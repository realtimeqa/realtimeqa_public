The Vatican goes into \"total lockdown\": the cardinals are unable to contact the outside world, and surrender all electronic devices on entry. The area is also \"swept for microphones and bugs\" to prevent any leaks.\n\nThe death of Pope Francis, who was laid to rest last month, has sparked a succession battle pitting conservatives against progressives. The cardinals who will vote for the next leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics are \"less predictable than ever before, with the vast majority having no experience of a papal conclave\", said The Guardian. \"A much wider geographic spread of cardinals adds to the uncertainty.\"\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber.

The longest in history took nearly three years with the election of Pope Gregory X in 1271 while Pope Francis was elected in just one day in 2013.\n\nHow is a new pope chosen?\n\nThe rituals surrounding the papal succession date back centuries, but the process has been given a modern revamp after a team of Catholic journalists and researchers compiled a new online guide to every cardinal who will choose the next pontiff.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe College of Cardinals Report — a \"slick, interactive website\", said Crux — features details of all 252 cardinals, including where they stand on issues such as ordaining female deacons, blessing same-sex unions and making priestly celibacy optional.\n\nOut of the 252 cardinals listed in the report, 135 of them are currently under the age of 80 and so eligible to participate in the conclave.\n\nAfter the death or resignation of a pope, the cardinals are called to convene in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, where they take an oath of secrecy and are isolated from the outside world. During this time, they can discuss the merits of likely candidates. Open campaigning is not allowed, said the BBC, but it is \"still a highly political process\".\n\nVoting is held through a series of secret ballots, with each cardinal elector writing a name of choice on a piece of paper. A two-thirds majority is required for any cardinal to win, although if the number of cardinal electors is not divisible by three, one additional vote is required. Four rounds of ballots are held each day until one man receives the required majority. Ballot papers are burnt after each session, giving off smoke that can be seen by onlookers outside. If the smoke is black, the cardinals have failed to reach a decision. White smoke signifies that a new pope has been chosen.\n\nWhat is the conclave?\n\nThe group of cardinals who form the conclave that selects next pope \"truly is is the world's most powerful electorate\" for its size, said the Financial Times. Francis – the first non-European pope since the eighth century – did a \"great deal to shape the choice\" of the upcoming conclave. Of the 133 cardinals under 80, the vast majority have been appointed by him, according to America magazine. The total number of electors is technically supposed to be capped at 120, but Francis is not the first pope to go over the limit.\n\nMost of the cardinals will have little inkling of the prospective papal candidates ahead of the conclave, said the College of Cardinals Report. Voting for a pope is not like voting in a political leadership contest, where the candidates are publicly scrutinised, often ad nauseam. A small number of the conclave will be curial cardinals, working in the Roman Curia that assists the pope in carrying out his governance of the Church, but the majority will be archbishops, serving in dioceses around the world.\n\nFrancis \"revolutionised\" the College of Cardinals by passing over large archdioceses like Los Angeles, Venice and Milan \"in favour of picking men from the peripheries who reflect his pastoral orientation and concern for the poor\", said America magazine. \"The result will be a conclave very different from the one that elected him. It will be less Italian, less European and less curial but will be more Asian and African.\"\n\nWhoever becomes the next pope, bookmakers believe there is a 50% chance he will be known as Francis II. Other names being touted include John Paul, Leo and John.\n\nWho are the front runners?\n\nFor many Catholic commentators, overt speculation on who the next pope might be while the current one is still alive is disrespectful. But following Francis' death, talks have been turbocharged on the potential papal candidates — known in Italian as the papabili. The front runners span a spectrum of backgrounds and ideological standpoints, so the conclave's eventual choice could well change the future direction of the Church.\n\nBut the unpredictability of the process, in which cardinals are sequestered for days of voting, means that all speculation is flawed, said US Catholic. They \"do a lot of praying to the Holy Spirit, who is full of surprises\".\n\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, Italy: A \"consummate Vatican diplomat\", 70-year-old Italian cardinal Pietro Parolin served as Pope Francis' secretary of state and is the current favourite to succeed him. He is known for brokering both the US-Cuba thaw, 10 years ago, and the 2018 Vatican-China agreement. Given current geopolitical volatility, the cardinal electors might well see the need for a diplomat, said US Catholic. For 11 years he has survived Francis' \"regular savage reshuffles\", said Damian Thompson in The Spectator. \"He is regarded as a moderate who would be able to repair the damage caused by his boss's outbursts and vendettas.\"\n\nCardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, Philippines: Filipino cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, 67, has long been a leading papabili among Vatican watchers and bookmakers. He is \"media-savvy, charismatic, and joyful\" said US Catholic. If elected, he would be the first Asian pope and the \"first truly fluent English-speaking pope in history\" (at least since Adrian IV, who was born in Hertfordshire and held the office in the 1150s). Cardinal Tagle is comfortable showing emotion and has a playful, folksy manner, said the College of Cardinals Report. His left-leaning politics are similar to Pope Francis' relatively progressive views on social justice issues.\n\nCardinal Peter Turkson, Ghana: Multilingual biblical scholar Cardinal Peter Turkson, 76, has been described as charming and softly spoken and has long been considered a front runner. However, his relatively liberal views on homosexuality, ecology and social justice put him at odds with some fellow cardinals as well as bishops in his own country of Ghana. While there is enthusiasm for electing a pope from Africa, where the Catholic population is growing, Cardinal Turkson is not generally seen as a unifying candidate.\n\nCardinal Péter Erdő, Hungary: An award-winning scholar and intellectual, Cardinal Péter Erdő, 72, is more conservative than the current pope and is seen as a potential \"consensus choice\", said US Catholic. He was brought up under a communist regime — his family fled Hungary with just the clothes on their backs when invading Soviet troops burned down their house in 1956 — and he has since overseen his country's church while Hungarian democracy slides into autocracy, \"a possibly applicable skillset these days\".\n\nCardinal Matteo Zuppi, Italy: The 69-year-old Archbishop of Bologna is a \"progressive who is regarded as having been close to Francis\", said The Telegraph. His extensive experience of conflict resolution saw him named Francis' peace envoy for the war in Ukraine. However, his relative youth \"may count against him\" as cardinals \"could be wary of appointing someone whose papacy could last for many years, concerned that the direction he takes the Church would become too entrenched\".\n\nCardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Italy: The 60-year-old Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem was only appointed a cardinal in 2023, but \"has gone from a left field option in the conclave to one of the favourites\", said The Independent. Fluent in Italian, Hebrew and English, he has spent decades leading Catholics in the Middle East, putting him in the spotlight at a time when events in Israel and Gaza are at the forefront of world and Church politics. \"As well as being a heroic figure with a keen ability as a diplomat he is also a leading Biblical scholar\", but his election as pope would be a \"significant geopolitical statement by the Church, especially at a time it has been highly critical of Benjamin Netanyahu's government\".\n\nAnd the wild card…\n\nCardinal Mykola Bychok, Ukraine: The 45-year-old Eparch of Saints Peter and Paul of Melbourne was made a cardinal by Pope Francis last year. He has \"spoken eloquently about the suffering of his fellow Ukrainians in the current war with Russia, and his Australian flock is largely composed of Greek Catholic refugees from the Balkan War and the conflict with Russia that broke out in 2014\", said Daniel Gallagher, a former Latin Secretary to Popes Benedict XVI and Francis and now lecturer in literature and philosophy at the US' Ralston College, in Crisis magazine.

Leo, who became the church's 267th pope, also spoke in Spanish but not English in his brief address.\n\nPrevost, 69 and originally from Chicago, has spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and has dual Peruvian nationality. He became a cardinal only in 2023 and less than two years later will officiate his first Mass as pope Friday, May 9, in the Sistine Chapel at 11 a.m. local time, 5 a.m. ET.\n\nLeo thanked Pope Francis and repeated his predecessor's call for a church that is engaged with the modern world and \"is always looking for peace, charity and being close to people, especially those who are suffering.\"\n\nHe wasn't one of the names mentioned frequently as top contenders to succeed Francis, who died April 21.\n\nHe had attracted interest from his peers because of his quiet style and backing of Francis' 12-year papacy, especially his devotion to social justice issues. Leo is considered a centrist, so perhaps a compromise choice, but is not seen as open to the LGBTQ+ community the way Francis was.\n\nRead the full transcript of Leo's first message to supporters around the world\n\nLeo appeared on the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica on May 8 after white smoke had billowed from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signifying the 133 cardinal electors had chosen a new leader for the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church.\n\n\"Peace be with you,'' he told the adoring crowd, pointing out those were the words Jesus Christ used to greet his disciples after his resurrection.\n\nYou can read the full text of his remarks here.\n\nLeo XIV pays homage to reformer with 25-year tenure\n\nWhile Francis picked a name that had never been used by a pontiff as he honored St. Francis of Assisi, the newest pope took a more traditional route.\n\nThirteen previous leaders of the Catholic Church had gone by the name Leo, though none since the election of Leo XIII in 1878. During his 25-year tenure, the fourth longest on record, Leo XIII became known as a reformer who advocated for diplomacy and scientific progress while positioning the church as a defender of human rights.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni told reporters the newly installed pope chose his name as a nod to the last pontiff named Leo. Margaret Thompson, an associate professor of history at Syracuse University, called that a \"powerful choice.''\n\n“Leo XIII is considered the father of Catholic social teaching,’’ Thompson said. “This signals a potential emphasis on justice, labor and the church’s role in the modern world.”\n\nHow to watch Pope Leo XIV’s first mass\n\nLeo's first Latin Mass will be broadcast live on Vatican News's YouTube channel.\n\nLeo's debut wardrobe was different than Francis'. Here's what changed.\n\nUpon his arrival to St. Peter's Basilica balcony on May 8, the newly elected Leo wore a bright red shoulder cover and ornately decorated stole, a contrast from the stark white attire the late Francis wore while stepping out on the balcony more than a decade ago.\n\nWhile Leo XIV's attire may have appeared lavish compared to Francis', the new pontiff actually took a more traditional approach, Rev. Bruce Morrill, a theology professor at Vanderbilt University, told USA TODAY on May 8.\n\nFor centuries, newly elected popes have worn a white cassock (ankle-length clerical coat), white zucchetto (skull cap), red pellegrina (shoulder cover), red and golden stole, and a pectoral cross (large cross worn as a necklace), Morrill explained. Each piece of the ensemble holds an important meaning in the Catholic faith.\n\nThe pellegrina, or shoulder cape, is attached to the cassock and is not limited to popes. Cardinals, bishops and priests can also wear the piece of clothing, which is why new popes often wear a red one.\n\nThe red and gold stole Leo wore on May 8 features ornate illustrations of the four gospels in the New Testament − Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, Morrill said.\n\n– Greta Cross\n\nJD Vance, nation's most senior Catholic official, congratulates new pope\n\nVice President JD Vance, 40, congratulated Leo in a post on X, saying, \"I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church.\"\n\n\"May God bless him!\" the vice president added.\n\nVance was baptized Catholic and received his first communion in 2019 at St. Gertrude Priory, which is attached to a Dominican parish in Cincinnati. He visited with Francis in Vatican City last month, one day before the former pope's death.\n\nWhile the vice president had tussled with Francis in the past over immigration, he called it an honor to meet with him and said his \"heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world\" after Francis' death.\n\n– Francesca Chambers, Grace Tucker\n\nAn 'extremely joyful day' for US Catholics\n\nThe stunning news of the Catholic Church's first American pope gave way to excitement for Catholics across the United States, who greeted the announcement that Leo had been named the global church's leader with delight.\n\n“I’m thrilled,” said Moises Rodrigues, a longtime city councilor in Brockton, Massachusetts. “Imagine, for the first time in our history having an American pope. Someone who understands American issues. And he’s also a friend of Pope Francis. I’m in gaga land.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rev. Msgr. W. Ronald Jameson, the director of St. Matthew’s Cathedral in Washington D.C., said the selection “totally shocked” him.\n\n“I never thought in my lifetime I would see an American pope,” he said as he listened to Pope Leo XIV's first words through a cell phone. “Today is an extremely joyful day.”\n\nJameson, who leads operations at the mother church of the archbishop of Washington, applauded the selection and says he's hopeful the new pope will push for unity, peace and inclusivity as Francis had.\n\nBefore he was elected pope, Leo XIV was critical of Trump, Vance on social media\n\nJust an hour before Prevost was introduced as pope, a crowd that had stood watch for hours with eyes glued to the Sistine Chapel chimney roared in elation as white smoke poured into the sky and bells tolled across the plaza, signaling the selection of a new leader of the church’s 1.4 billion members.\n\nBefore being elected as the leader of the Catholic church, Leo XIV shared social media posts criticizing President Donald Trump's and Vance's stances on immigration.\n\nIn three posts, then-Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost of Chicago was critical of Vance's take on religion, shared an article critiquing Vance's statements on deportation of migrants and retweeted criticism of Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's response to the deportation of Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a resident of Maryland.\n\nOne post from Feb. 3, 2025, pointed to an article in the National Catholic Reporter titled, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\"\n\nVance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, had cited medieval-era Catholic teaching to justify the United States' new immigration policy under Trump.\n\nIn 2015, Prevost posted a link to a Washington Post opinion piece titled \"Cardinal Dolan: Why Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric is so problematic.\"\n\nFrancis, Leo's predecessor, clashed repeatedly with Trump and Vance, particularly over the administration's immigration policies. He was critical of their plans to deport millions of migrants from the United States, as well as widespread cuts to foreign aid and domestic welfare programs.\n\n– Sarah D. Wire and Francesca Chambers\n\nLGBTQ+ Catholic group welcomes new pope – hopes 'his heart and mind have developed more progressively'\n\nNew Ways Ministry, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics, said in a statement to USA TODAY that it \"welcomes\" Pope Leo XIV as the new leader of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe group also said it was disappointed to see reports that Leo has made statements criticizing the acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, including remarks in 2012 to a group of bishops.\n\n\"We pray that in the 13 years that have passed,12 of which were under the papacy of Pope Francis, that his heart and mind have developed more progressively on LGBTQ+ issues, and we will take a wait-and-see attitude to see if that has happened,\" said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nProminent Catholics Biden, Pelosi welcome first American pope\n\nTwo of the most most prominent Catholics in American politics celebrated the selection of the first pope from the United States, which was not certain to happen in their lifetimes.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden, 82, greeted the news with a post on X using the Latin term to announce a new pontiff has been chosen: “Habemus papam.’’\n\n“May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois,’’ Biden’s post continued. “Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.’’\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi, still a House representative for San Francisco, was more expansive in her own social media post, pointing out Pope Leo was “elected by one of the largest and most diverse conclaves ever.’’\n\nPelosi, 85, welcomed the new pontiff’s message of openness and unity, and she urged prayer for his success. “It is heartening that His Holiness continued the blessing that Pope Francis gave on Easter Sunday: “God loves everyone. Evil will not prevail,’” she wrote.\n\nWho are Robert Prevost's family members? Here are Pope Leo XIV's parents, siblings\n\nPope Leo XIV's family includes his father, Louis Marius Prevost, of French and Italian descent, according to a news release from the Vatican, and his mother, Mildred Martínez, of Spanish descent. The Chicago Sun-Times has reported his father was an educator and his mother a librarian.\n\nHe has two brothers, Louis Martín Prevost and John Joseph Prevost.\n\nRobert Prevost attended Catholic Theological Union in Chicago and Villanova University in Pennsylvania before earning a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.\n\nHow a Chicago native became pope: See Robert Francis Prevost's path to making history\n\nPrevost will succeed a groundbreaking, pioneering pope whose progressive positions, emphasis on inclusivity and ability to connect with people all over the world, from all backgrounds and across different faiths, made him a beloved religious figure, even in secular realms.\n\nPrevost was pastor of vocations and director of missions for the Augustinian order in Chicago and worked in Peru for several years teaching canon law. He also served as a parish pastor, diocesan official, seminary teacher and vicar. He served two terms as the head of the Augustinian order, until 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Francis appointed him to an administrative post in Peru, and became bishop there, as well as vice president of the Peruvian Bishops Conference until 2023.\n\nHis most recent position, prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, was a powerful one: He was responsible for selecting bishops. Prevost was elevated by Pope Francis to the rank of cardinal in September 2023.\n\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral bells echo along Manhattan skyscrapers\n\nAlong Manhattan's famed 5th Avenue, church bells echoed from St. Patrick's Cathedral between the skyscrapers. The papal flag fluttered next to the American flag at the cathedral's entrance.\n\nThe daily noon Mass was ending when the priest delivered the news of a new pope, said Helen Benicaso, 71, of West Orange, N.J. The congregation erupted in applause.\n\n\"'Once a Catholic, always a Catholic,''' as Bruce Springsteen says,\" Helen Benicaso, a retired school teacher, told USA TODAY as people gathered in front of the cathedral. \"You never stray because it's always there − the beliefs and moral code of living.”\n\nShe and her husband, Girard, 77, visited New York City to see a show at Carnegie Hall the night before. On May 8, the married couple of 43 years went to mass before heading home to New Jersey.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nChicago church officials 'happily shocked' with selection of American-born pope – and curious about his baseball allegiances\n\nLarry Sullivan, Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Chicago, said at a Thursday press conference, “It's a day of great excitement for Chicago, for the United States to have one of our own be elected as the pope to serve as the Holy Father.”\n\nSullivan said he has not worked with the new pope directly but knows many people who know him personally and are members of the Augustinian community.\n\n“I have been hearing wonderful stories about Cardinal Prevost long before there was any consideration that he might have been elected as pope,” Sullivan said.\n\nFather Gregory Sakowicz, Rector of Chicago’s Holy Name Cathedral, recounted a similar sense of surprise, saying he was “happily shocked,” before joking with reporters over a detail about the new pope he’s yet to learn.\n\n“Now one burning question I have is, the fact that the Pope Leo XIV, (former) Cardinal Prevost, was born in Chicago in the South Side, is he a Chicago White Sox fan?”\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nTrump, Obama, other US political leaders embrace first pope from the United States\n\nSeveral American political figures welcomed the unexpected emergence of the first pope from the United States.\n\nPresident Donald Trump offered his congratulations to Leo in a social media post, saying: \"What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!''\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, a native of Chicago, also congratulated their \"fellow Chicagoan'' through a post on the X platform. \"This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith,\" the posting said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement he was praying for Pope Leo to \"impart wisdom, strength, and grace\" in his new role.\"\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who is Catholic, said he was surprised and “emotional” to hear the new pope is an American. Kaine said the last pope named Leo was “really known as a working person’s pope,” and added of Prevost, “Taking that name really sends a message of where his heart lies.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers and Riley Beggin\n\nAt last, a U.S. pope: Robert Francis Prevost's path to becoming Pope Leo XIV\n\nNew pope selected: Who is Robert Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV?\n\nPrevost attended Villanova University and Catholic Theological Union in Chicago before earning a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.\n\nHe served as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops (formerly known as the Congregation for Bishops) and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America since 2023. He was also the Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru from 2015 to 2023, part of a nearly four-decade stretch when he went back and forth between serving in Peru and Chicago, starting in 1985.\n\nIn addressing the St. Peter's Square crowd Thursday, Leo sent a special greeting in Spanish \"to my beloved Chiclayo diocese in Peru.'\n\nAs a cardinal Prevost kept a low profile and granted few interviews. But he said in a 2023 Vatican press conference: \"Our work is to enlarge the tent and to let everyone know they are welcome inside the church.\"\n\nCardinals voted multiple times before the pope was chosen\n\nThe cardinals spent Thursday morning shut off from the world inside the Sistine Chapel, the historic sanctuary adorned with frescoes from Michelangelo and other Renaissance artists. The cardinals prayed for guidance and conducted two secretive votes, trying to determine new leadership for the world's 1.4 billion Roman Catholics.\n\nThe electors returned to their lodging quarters, Casa Santa Marta, for lunch and reconvened late Thursday afternoon.\n\nWhat happens after we see white smoke? How long did it take for a new pope to be announced?\n\nIt took about an hour between the time white smoke wafted from the Sistine Chapel chimney and the new Pope Leo was announced to the exultant crowd. There's no set schedule for such introductions.\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis was announced a little over an hour after white smoke plumed from the chimney, per previous reporting by The Daily Telegraph. In that hour, the elected cardinal chose his papal name before appearing on the Sistine Chapel balcony, greeting the world as pope for the first time.\n\n−Greta Cross\n\nMom waits to learn whether son will be next pope\n\nOver 350 miles from the conclave in Rome, Maria Tadini was focused on the small television in her modest home in the northern Italy town of Castel Liteggio. She later learned her son, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, did not become the next pope. Pizzaballa was one of a half dozen or more cardinals considered strong candidates.\n\n\"Here he is! There he is! Hello, my joy,\" she said when Pizzaballa appeared on the screen with other cardinals entering the Sistine Chapel. \"Pierbattista, come home!\"\n\nPizzaballa, 60, has served the church in Jerusalem since 1990. He drew global notice after the Hamas attack on southern Israel in 2023 when he offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the release of children taken by the militants.\n\nTadini, who will turn 90 next month, says she has visited her son in Jerusalem three times.\n\n\"If he has to (go to Rome), it's fine, but it's also fine if he goes back to Jerusalem,\" Tadini told the Italian media outlet Corriere della Sera. \"He spent many years there and did well. I wouldn't mind. If he stays in Rome, it's another task, but in the Holy Land he has always done his duty.\"\n\nCrowds back at St. Peter's Square for second day\n\nThousands of tourists, pilgrims and just interested Romans gathered in St Peter's Square for a second day Thursday, eager to see white smoke emerge from the chimney, signaling a successor to Francis had been selected. During the morning the smoke was black, meaning no candidate has received the necessary two-thirds majority. That changed at 6:06 p.m. local time.\n\nTom Barbitta, from North Carolina, is vacationing in Italy with his wife, Susan, and came to the square to see the smoke.\n\n\"Francis was a great guy, down to earth, humble,\" Barbitta told Reuters. \"I hope they will choose someone just like him.\"\n\nMany people in the square had scheduled their visits to Rome well before Pope Francis died or the conclave had been scheduled.\n\n“Being here during this conclave is a miracle,” Linda Perotti from Colorado, told the Associated Press. “I truly believe that the pope that they vote in will be a healer, will bring unity to this world.\"\n\nDean of cardinals sees 'need for an awakening'\n\nThere are more than 250 cardinals, but only those under age 80 are \"electors\" who can participate in the conclave. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the dean of the College of Cardinals, is 91 years old and thus has not been locked up in the Sistene Chapel with his colleagues.

Still, a record 133 cardinals from 70 countries were casting votes, up from 115 from 48 nations for the 2013 conclave that elected Francis. The increase in cardinals is a function of Francis' efforts to expand the reach of the church, and one result is that 80% of current voting cardinals were appointed by him.\n\nBlack smoke vs. white smoke: What does each color mean during conclave?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/04/21/who-will-be-next-pope-candidates/80000828007/", "title": "Who will be the next pope?

A two-thirds majority is needed. Votes are cast in the Sistine Chapel and cardinals are sequestered there.\n\nHere are some of the top candidates for Francis' successor.\n\nWho could become the next pope?\n\nCardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle\n\nPosition: Former archbishop of Manila\n\nFormer archbishop of Manila Nationality: Filipino\n\nFilipino Age: 67\n\n67 What else?

He was a math major at Villanova.\n\nHe is an Augustinian priest and Villanova is the lone Augustinian Catholic university in the United States.\n\n\"Today, we joyously celebrate the election of His Holiness, Pope Leo XIV, a moment of profound significance for the global Church. A Villanova alumnus, Pope Leo XIV is the first Pope from the United States and the first Augustinian friar to be elected,\" the university posted on X.\n\nPope Leo, in his opening address, made note that he is an Augustinian, saying that while that was his order he was a Christian and a bishop. “So we can all walk together,” he told the cheering crowd.\n\nBells rang out on the Villanova campus when the announcement was made, according to broadcast reports.\n\n“As an Augustinian Catholic institution, we celebrate this significant day for our University community and the global Church. Villanova, built on the teachings of St. Augustine, has always been grounded in advancing a deeper understanding of the fundamental relationship between faith and reason—between spirituality and wisdom,” said Villanova President Rev. Peter M. Donohue said. “With today’s election of His Holiness, Pope Leo XIV, I cannot help but reflect on what his Augustinian papacy will mean to our University community and our world. Known for his humility, gentle spirit, prudence and warmth, Pope Leo XIV’s leadership offers an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to our educational mission.\n\nWho is the new pope: At last, a pope from the U.S.: Robert Francis Prevost's path to becoming Pope Leo XIV\n\nWith eyes on the Sistine Chapel chimneys, the crowd erupted in cheers as white smoke poured into the sky and bells tolled across the plaza, signaling the new leader of the church’s 1.4 billion members.\n\nHis election came on the second day of the conclave that drew cardinals from 70 nations. The new pope after the election, must decide if he wants to fill the role and if so, choose a name. He dons papal vestments in a chamber in the chapel known as the Room of Tears – named for the emotional reactions of popes who realize their new responsibilities.\n\nThen the pope is taken to the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, where a senior cardinal announces \"Habemus Papam,\" the Latin term for \"We have a pope\" to the waiting crowd.\n\nThe pope then addresses the crowd, blessing them, the city and the world.\n\nBishop with Archdiocese of Philadelphia witnesses election of pope\n\nThe Archdiocese of Philadelphia shared a live video on its Facebook and Instagram pages from Christopher Cooke, an auxiliary bishop to the Archbishop of Philadelphia assigned to Bucks County, who was spending a few days in Rome for a priest pilgrimage.\n\nElated by the news, Cooke recorded his reaction as he stood in St. Peter's Square.\n\n\"We are so delighted to be here at St. Peter’s tonight and witness this amazing experience, this work of the Holy Spirit. So I offer prayers and congratulations to the whole church in celebration this evening. What a great night this is for the life of the church and blessings to everyone back home as our priest pilgrimage returns,\" he said.\n\nArchbishop of Philadelphia shares experience working with Pope Leo XIV\n\nShortly following the announcement of the new pope, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia issued a statement from Archbishop Nelson J. Pérez, who had worked and conversed with the incoming pope as a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America while the new pope served as its president during his tenure as a cardinal.\n\n\"I witnessed first-hand a wonderful, gentle, humble, and spiritual man of God who is a true gift to the world,\" Pérez said in part in a press release Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"Pope Leo XIV will be a pastor not just for Catholics, but for every person of good will. He is a man of deep faith and extraordinary intellectual ability who understands the pastoral needs of our richly diverse Church as well as the challenges of our modern society. I know that his papacy will be marked by a desire for genuine Christian encounter with all people and that it will be filled with the compassionate love of Jesus Christ.\"\n\nCardinals voted multiple times before the pope was chosen\n\nThe cardinals spent the morning shut off from the world, inside the historic chapel adorned with frescoes from Michelangelo and other Renaissance artists. They prayed for guidance and conducted two secretive votes, trying to determine new leadership for the world's 1.4 billion Roman Catholics.\n\nThe electors returned to their living quarters, Casa Santa Marta, for lunch and reconvened late Thursday afternoon.\n\nHow long until new pope is announced?\n\nThere isn't a set schedule for when the new pope will be introduced, following the eagerly anticipated white smoke. However, past conclaves help clue us in.\n\nIn 2013, Pope Francis was introduced a little over an hour after white smoke plumed from the chapel chimney, per previous reporting by The Daily Telegraph. In that hour, the elected cardinal chose his papal name. About 20 minutes after his name was announced as the new pontiff, Francis appeared on the Sistine Chapel balcony, greeting the world as pope for the first time.\n\n−Greta Cross\n\nWhat are the cardinals eating at the conclave?\n\nThe Italian news agency ANSA reported that foods that could be used to get messages into the papal conclave such as asparagus, ravioli and whole chicken are off the menu. It includes little wine and dessert only on Sundays, ANSA said.\n\nItalian nutritionist Giorgio Calabrese, who prepared the suggested menu for the cardinals, said it is specifically designed specifically to provide the necessary energy for the sedentary life they could be living for several days. Calabrese told the Catholic News Agency' that at breakfast the cardinals need the immediate energy of simple carbohydrates − sweet breakfast, with \"partially skimmed milk and toast with jam or honey\" instead of bacon and eggs, he said. His suggested lunch menu was light pasta or risotto, white meat or grilled fish and steamed or grilled vegetables.\n\nDinner should be cooked ham, lean beef, smoked salmon, bluefish, tuna or sardines and fresh cheeses. Calabrese said cardinals who desire wine should drink “only a glass.”\n\nMom waits to learn whether son will be next pope\n\nOver 350 miles from the conclave in Rome, Maria Tadini is focused on the small television in her modest home in the northern Italy town of Castel Liteggio. Tadini will soon learn whether her son, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, will become the next pope. Pizzaballa is one of a half dozen or more cardinals considered strong candidates.\n\n\"Here he is! There he is! Hello, my joy,\" she says when Pizzaballa appears on the screen with other cardinals entering the Sistine Chapel. \"Pierbattista, come home!\"\n\nPizzaballa, 60, has served the church in Jerusalem since 1990. He drew global notice after the Hamas attack on southern Israel in 2023 when he offered himself as a hostage in exchange for the release of chidren taken by the militants.\n\nTadini, who will turn 90 next month, says she has visited her son in Jerusalem three times.\n\n\"If he has to (go to Rome), it's fine, but it's also fine if he goes back to Jerusalem,\" Tadini told the Italian media outlet Corriere della Sera. \"He spent many years there and did well. I wouldn't mind. If he stays in Rome, it's another task, but in the Holy Land he has always done his duty.\"\n\nCrowds back at St. Peter's Square for second day\n\nThousands of tourists, pilgrims and just interested Romans gathered in St Peter's Square for a second day Thursday. They hoped to see white smoke emerge from the chimney, signaling a successor to Francis, who died April 21, had been selected. The smoke, just like Wednesday evening, was black, meaning no candidate has received the necessary two-thirds majority.\n\nTom Barbitta, from North Carolina, is vacationing in Italy with his wife, Susan, and came to the square to see the smoke.\n\n\"Francis was a great guy, down to earth, humble,\" Barbitta told Reuters. \"I hope they will choose someone just like him.\"\n\nMany people in the square had scheduled their visits to Rome well before Pope Francis died or the conclave had been scheduled.\n\n“Being here during this conclave is a miracle,” Linda Perotti from Colorado, told the Associated Press. “I truly believe that the pope that they vote in will be a healer, will bring unity to this world.\"\n\nDean of cardinals sees 'need for an awakening'\n\nThere are more than 250 cardinals, but only those under age 80 are \"electors\" who can participate in the conclave. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the dean of the College of Cardinals, is 91 years old and thus has not been locked up in the Sistene Chapel with his colleagues. Re was in Pompeii on Thursday but said he planned on returning to Rome.\n\n\"I hope that this evening when I return to Rome I will already find the white smoke,\" Re told Corriere della Sera.

There is no set time limit for the conclave, but recent conclaves have lasted only a few days. Since 1846, cardinals have taken two to five days to make decisions on the past 12 popes.\n\nIt was not always that fast. After Pope Clement IV died in November 1268, cardinals met in Viterbo, Italy, about 68 miles from Rome, for almost three years. The eventual winner, Gregory X, tightened up conclave rules. The longest conclave in modern times, in 1903, ended when Pope Pius X was chosen after five days.\n\nUS Cardinal Dolan on why conclave could take time\n\nA day before electors were sequestered to begin the conclave, an American cardinal shed light on the secretive process of electing a new pope, saying this one could take three or four days in part because there are many worthy candidates.\n\nNew York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, one of 10 U.S. cardinals participating in the vote, told SiriusXM’s Catholic Channel on Tuesday that participants consult with each other to learn more about contenders they might not know well.\n\n“We're not horse trading here,’’ Dolan said. “We're saying, ‘Tell me about this guy. You're from Latin America. Go through the list of bishops. Tell me some of these fellas. Am I right to be enchanted by this guy?’”\n\nAfrica seen as key to church's future\n\nRecent years have seen Catholicism’s geographic balance increasingly shift toward the global south. “The future of the Catholic church passes through Africa,” said Stan Chu Ilo, an associate professor of Catholic studies at Depaul University in Chicago. “The continent is a spiritual powerhouse.”\n\nAs of 2023, Africa accounted for 20% of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics, reflecting what the Vatican calls “a highly dynamic spread” of the faith; the continent’s Catholic population that year surged to 281 million, up from 272 million in 2022.\n\nCardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline of Algeria are all contenders to be the next pope.\n\n(This story has been updated to include more detail and visual elements.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/05/06/who-is-pietro-parolin-pope-candidate/83471799007/", "title": "Who is Pietro Parolin?

Follow USA TODAY's live coverage of the announcement of a new pope on Thursday, May 8.\n\nCould the Roman Catholic Church return to its long tradition of Italian popes? For the first time since the death of John Paul I in 1978, it could happen.\n\nPietro Parolin, a cardinal and longtime Vatican diplomat, is among the top contenders to succeed Pope Francis, who died April 21 at the age of 88.\n\nThe last Italian pope was John Paul I, who died suddenly just 33 days into his papacy. His successor, Pope John Paul II, was Polish, the first non-Italian pope in 455 years.\n\nWith the election of Parolin, the church would return to a long tradition of Italian popes. The 70-year-old is viewed by many as a moderate, less progressive than Francis, but not as conservative as Pope Benedict XVI, Francis' predecessor. Parolin most recently served as Francis' secretary of state, akin to a deputy pope, since 2013.\n\nHis extensive experience in international relations includes times as the Vatican's ambassador Venezuela, as well as the driving force behind the Vatican's rapprochement with China and Vietnam.\n\nA long career in diplomacy\n\nThe son of a hardware store manager and a teacher, Parolin began his training in diplomacy shortly after being ordained at the age of 25. His early work took him to Nigeria and Mexico before he was called back to Rome. He's fluent in French and Spanish as well as his native Italian and is proficient in English.\n\nParolin has been the Vatican's Secretary of State for 12 years, the pope's top diplomat and, essentially, the pontiff's second-in-command. That role means he's well known to all of the electors in the papal conclave, and is seen as a quiet pragmatist, and one who occasionally had to temper Francis' sometimes off-the-cuff remarks to the media.\n\nOrdained in 1980, Parolin's career has been spent almost entirely in Vatican diplomacy, in Rome and elsewhere. He's never led a diocese, though, a significant gap in pastoral experience that his supporters say is tempered by his work with the faithful as the pope's representative around the world.\n\nControversy over China, real estate investments\n\nSome conservatives in the U.S. and Asia criticized a 2018 Vatican agreement with China, giving Chinese authorities some say in who may serve as Catholic bishops in the country; Parolin was the agreement's architect but it had the support of both Francis and Benedict, a conservative.\n\nParolin was also leading the Vatican's diplomatic arm when it lost aboutt $140 million in a botched investment in a London property, leading to a corruption trial and conviction of one of Parolin's deputies for embezzlement and fraud.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/04/29/is-conclave-movie-accurate-pope-francis-death/83343702007/", "title": "How real is 'Conclave'? Pope Francis' death recalls the movie", "text": "April 29, 2025, 12:14 p.m. ET\n\nThe death of Pope Francis marks the end of an era for the Catholic Church, and paves the way for one of the most arcane, storied and secretive events in human history: the election of a new pope.\n\nFrancis died Easter Monday at 88, the Vatican announced. First elected in March 2013 as the 266th pope, his death now prompts the centuries-old process of choosing his successor, which will begin May 7.\n\nThat event is also known as a conclave, a term that lends its name to a 2016 Robert Harris book-turned-Oscar-winning movie. \"Conclave\" is set during a fictional meeting of red-cloaked cardinals who have flocked to the Eternal City to cast ballots for who will lead the world's roughly 1.4 billion Catholics.\n\nThe thriller is available to stream on Prime Video or to rent or buy on on-demand platforms such as Apple TV and Fandango.\n\nMany are familiar with the final moments of a conclave, when the white smoke famously rises from a chimney just outside the Sistine Chapel, sending the assembled faithful into a frenzy of cheers, followed by the appearance of the newly elected pontiff on the central balcony at St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nWhen will a new pope be chosen? Timeline of the papal conclave\n\nBut given that the Vatican doesn't really do Hollywood, one wonders how the filmmakers were able to capture the nuanced details − from elaborate clothing to Latinate voting oaths − shown in the movie, which stars Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow as at-odds cardinals, and Isabella Rossellini as an inquisitive nun.\n\n\"We were given a private tour of the Vatican, and they were quite welcoming, actually, quite helpful,\" says \"Conclave\" screenwriter Peter Straughan, speaking to USA TODAY ahead of the film's release in 2024. \"So it was a big research project, really. It's a fascinating and theatrical world, so you want to get those details right. It's a very sumptuous thing.\"\n\nVatican officials seemed OK with the shocking premise of the film, Straughan adds, as well as its portrayal of a conclave's political machinations. \"We didn't want to be toothless in our approach to the church, which has many faults, but we wanted to be respectful of the heart of the Catholic Church,\" he says.\n\nStraughan guides USA TODAY through the questions that surface when watching \"Conclave.\"\n\nDo the 235 Roman Catholic cardinals really get sequestered like juries until they choose a pope?\n\nYes. As shown in \"Conclave,\" once a Vatican official faces the assembled cardinals and says the words \"extra omnes\" (or \"everyone out\") the cardinals are allowed to interact only with each other. \"There isn't supposed to be any information coming in from the outside world, or going out, that could sway the election in any way,\" Straughan says.\n\nThere are, however, some officials who as needed can act as emissaries, even if the cardinals themselves cannot leave until a successful ballot is cast, meaning one cardinal receives two-thirds of the votes and is elected pope. \"While some people can go back and forth, I'm not sure they're used as detectives as they are in our story,\" Straughan says.\n\nDo cardinals who gather for a conclave sleep on the premises?\n\nThe cardinals stay at the Casa Santa Marta, a fairly simple dormitory on Vatican grounds. They are allowed to mix and mingle in nearby buildings and courtyards, and dine together in a cafeteria setting staffed by nuns.\n\n\"Visually you get this strange mix of absolute ancient beauty and tremendous scale, contrasting with this almost business conference center feel,\" Straughan says. \"You get this major stage feel, with the Sistine Chapel and these men deciding who will represent the world's Catholics, and then this almost modest backstage feel. Quite the contrast, which makes for a great setting.\"\n\nIs the voting process in a papal conclave as formal as shown in 'Conclave'?\n\nWhen cardinals assemble to elect a pope, they vote as often as four times a day, especially in the first day or two, to determine which candidates are most likely to garner a majority vote. As shown in \"Conclave,\" the balloting process is not a raucous affair but solemn and filled with ritual. \"Each time each cardinal votes, he must walk up to the bowl where his written vote will be placed and recite an oath (in Latin),\" Straughan says.\n\nOne by one, the cardinals place their folded ballots atop a round plate and slide it into an oval urn while reciting an oath. As \"Conclave\" shows, those ballots are sewn together with a needle and thread, and then burned with a chemical to send either black smoke, meaning a stalemate, or white, signifying \"habemus papam\" − \"we have a pope.\"\n\nHow much of 'Conclave' was actually filmed at the Vatican?\n\nNone. \"You can't film at the Vatican, ever,\" says Straughan. \"We had to come up with alternatives.\"\n\nMost of those alternatives were in fact in Rome, which is packed with marble-encrusted buildings from centuries past that can double for many of the chambers, staircases and hallways featured in \"Conclave.\" (One notable exception: The instantly recognizable interiors of the Sistine Chapel were re-created on a soundstage, and Michelangelo's famous ceiling is a computer-generated replica of the real thing.)\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)\n\nContributing: Taijuan Moorman and Kim Willis", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/05/04/could-there-be-american-pope/83385288007/", "title": "Will we see first-ever American pope?

There have been 266 popes, and 217 of the have been Italian. Francis made history as the first pope from Latin America, and there has never been one from the U.S.\n\nStill, two Americans drawing attention are Cardinal Raymond Burke, 76, a critic of Francis' progressive actions whom Francis removed as the Vatican's high court justice in 2014, and Cardinal Joseph Tobin, 72, archbishop of Newark, N.J., who was named a cardinal by Francis.\n\nMelissa Wilde, a sociologist of religion and inequality and chairperson of the Department of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, acknowledged it is difficult to predict what the cardinals will decide when the conclave gathers. But she shared her perceptions based on geography with USA TODAY.\n\n\"It will not be another Latin American, it will most likely not be an American, but this could be the wild card,\" she said. \"I would say Asian or African, if not one of them, American, if not one of them, an Italian.\"\n\nThe Rev. James Bretzke, a theology professor at John Carroll University in Ohio, indicated he believes Americans may fall further down the list. Burke, for example, might claim a few votes in the early rounds \"then disappear totally from the tallies after that\" as cardinals who backed him switch to other conservatives gaining more momentum, Bretzke said.\n\nPope has role as global diplomat\n\nBretzke says a pope is a diplomat who must be accepted globally, and the papacy must appear to represent a cross-section of the world. In the past, Italians were viewed within the church as diplomats, so they were more acceptable across ethnic groups − although this appears to be less important now, he said.\n\n\"However, these considerations will continue, in my opinion, to prevent any American from being elected the next pope, even if otherwise he might be well qualified,\" Bretzke said. \"America’s image in the world simply is too powerful − and to be blunt, ugly.\"\n\nThe Rev. Patrick Flanagan, associate professor of theology and religious studies at St. John’s University in New York, says he has seen various reviews of the “elite eight, fabulous four, and the latest May Madness chart.\" But he emphasized the adage “in pope, out cardinal,\" meaning anyone who goes into a conclave thinking they will become pope usually exits the conclave still a cardinal.\n\nTrump makes a papal pitch\n\nTrump on Tuesday joked he’d like to be the next leader of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n“I’d like to be pope,” Trump told reporters outside the White House. “That would be my No. 1 choice.”\n\nIn response to Trump’s remarks, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham jokingly wrote on X that he was “excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope.”\n\n“This would truly be a dark horse candidate, but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this possibility!” he wrote. “The first Pope-U.S. President combination has many upsides. Watching for white smoke…. Trump MMXXVIII!”\n\nTrump also made what appeared to be a playful pitch for Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, saying there was someone in New York who is \" very good, so we’ll see what happens.\"\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/faith/2025/04/21/pope-conclave-process-archbishops-cardinals/83191273007/", "title": "Would Cardinal Seán O'Malley be considered for pope? It's possible.", "text": "Updated April 21, 2025, 9:04 a.m. ET\n\nPope Francis died Monday, the Vatican announced.\n\nA new pope will be selected through a process called the conclave, which consists of a vote by members of the College of Cardinals.\n\nTwo U.S. archbishops are considered papabile, or frontrunners for pope. One of them is Boston's former archbishop Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley.\n\nPope Francis, 88, a humble reformer who sought to make the Catholic Church more inclusive much to the ire of some conservatives, has died, the Vatican said Easter Monday.\n\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, Camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, announced the pope's death from the Casa Santa Marta, according to Vatican News.\n\nWith the pope's death, a new pope will be selected through a process called the conclave, which consists of a vote by members of the College of Cardinals.\n\nTechnically, any baptized Roman Catholic male can be elected pope, including archbishops from the United States, like Boston's current Archbishop Richard Henning and former Boston Archbishop, Cardinal Seán Patrick O'Malley. But, traditionally the pope is selected from the College of Cardinals.\n\nHere's a look at how the process works and the individuals who could be favored to be the next pope.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nCould a U.S. archbishop be the next pope?\n\nWhile any baptized Catholic male is technically eligible to be elected pope, traditionally, the pope has been chosen from the College of Cardinals since 1378, according to Religion News Service.\n\nThat means a U.S. archbishop could be chosen as pope, but it's not likely unless they are also a cardinal. Henning, who became archbishop of Boston last year, is not a cardinal.\n\nThere are currently 17 cardinals from the United States, and 10 of them are eligible to vote in the next conclave — meaning they are under the age of 80. A cardinal can be chosen as pope even if they are above the age of 80.\n\nItaly, which currently has 51 cardinals, is the only country with more than the United States.\n\nWho is 'papabile' or leading candidate to be pope?\n\nEdward Pentin, the National Catholic Register's longtime senior Rome correspondent, released a book in August 2020 called \"The Next Pope: The Leading Cardinal Candidates.\"\n\nIn it, he lists 19 cardinals he considers papabile, or \"popeable\" frontrunners for the role.\n\nAmong them, Pentin notes Cardinal Seán Patrick O'Malley, former archbishop of Boston, as a possible choice for the next pope.\n\nO'Malley retired as the Boston's archbishop over the summer, at the age of 80, but has remained on the Pope's Council of Cardinals. If he's still in the running, his age will likely be a point of discussion. The oldest pope on election was Pope Clement X in 1670 at the age of 79.\n\nThe other American on Pentin's list is Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who was previously archbishop of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nCardinals voting in the conclave may not necessarily choose a pope from among those seen as papabile. However, both Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI were considered papabile before being chosen, according to many Vatican experts.\n\nHow does the conclave process work?\n\nThe papal election, which is called the conclave, occurs when the pope resigns or dies and the College of Cardinals selects a new pope.\n\nAccording to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, cardinals typically gather 15 to 20 days after a papal vacancy to partake in the conclave process.\n\nThe cardinal electors, which consists only of cardinals under the age of 80, vote by secret ballot at the Sistine Chapel. Four rounds of voting take place every day until a candidate receives a majority two-thirds of the vote.\n\nMelina Khan is a trending reporter for the USA TODAY Network - New England, which serves more than a dozen affiliated news organizations across New England.

Bets are flying on who will be the next pope", "text": "May 3, 2025 Updated May 7, 2025, 11:00 a.m. ET\n\nThe wagers fly as the highest-ranking leaders of the Catholic Church converge in Rome to pick the next successor to St. Peter's throne. Bettors play the numbers as bookmakers set odds like it's the ides of March Madness. \"The people of Italy are in a state of excitement that is indescribable,\" the screaming headlines exclaim.\n\nThat was in 1878, but it could well have been today. Betting on the pope's election is a pastime that goes back at least 600 years, and while it may not be exactly legal in the United States, bets are being laid down in Britain and beyond as the conclave to pick Pope Francis’ successor gets set to begin on May 7.\n\n“Gamblers will seek to place wagers of any type, whether it’s football or popes,” said Bill Ordine, author of “Fantasy Sports, Real Money: The Unlikely Rise of Daily Fantasy\" and a now-retired former national writer for Gambling.com. \"This is a lot harder to pick than, say, the number one pick in the NFL draft.\"\n\nPapal betting is a gray area in the world of gambling. You can't plop down an official bet at a casino in Las Vegas and there are few if any U.S.-based web sites that will accept bets on the next pope. But there are numerous sites that spell out the odds. From that point, it's up to people to figure out how to place a bet. Many times in the U.S., the bets are informal, made with poker buddies or neighbors.\n\nR. Andrew Chesnut, chair in Catholic studies at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said betting on the pope is part of \"a larger culture of betting on everything. You can even bet on the deaths of celebrities. Everything’s become bettable these days, so it’s no surprise that this would, too. It’s something of interest to billions.”\n\nThat doesn't mean the church doesn't consider the practice bad sport. As Father Paul Keller of the Diocese of Columbus recently wrote in the Catholic Times: \"It’s not smart to place bets on who the next pope will or should be. It is not only indecorous, it’s indecent and shameful, because it compares a most holy office and man with a horserace or roulette wheel.\"\n\nNevertheless, as the Sistine Chapel gathering of papal electors approaches, pundits and punters alike are weighing in on their potential choice.\n\nWill it be Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, the former archbishop of Manila dubbed the “Asian Francis,” who would be the first Asian pope in history? Or will it be Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the longtime Vatican diplomat who could mark a compromise between Catholic progressives and conservatives?\n\nCould it be former contender Peter Erdo, the theological conservative from Hungary? Or American Cardinal Joseph Tobin, the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey? Will the next pope be Italian, or might he represent the growing Catholic stronghold of Africa?\n\nOddsmakers are closely monitoring the shifting sands, with sites such as Britain’s Online Betting Guide offering updates and capsules of the front runners. With the passing of Pope Francis on April 21, the site noted, Tagle and Parolin emerged as the early favorites, with Parolin moving into the lead and maintaining it ever since.\n\n“The move to make Parolin the new favorite reflects both his deep roots within the Vatican and his status as a diplomatic heavyweight,” wrote Josh Ashton, the site’s senior news editor and current affairs betting expert. “While Tagle still has strong support, bettors may now be looking for someone who can unify more traditional elements within the Church.”\n\nAlong with who the next pope might be, bettors can wager on what name the new pontiff will pick and what nation he will represent. While Italy is deemed the most likely individual country from which the next pope will originate, the favorite among oddsmakers is currently “a country that has never had a pope,” with a 60% likelihood.\n\n“I’m old enough to remember that if the guy wasn’t Italian, he wasn’t going to be the pope,” Ordine said.\n\nMore than 200 of the Catholic Church’s 266 popes have been Italian in origin, but the last several papal elections have seen the church buck that norm.\n\nIn 1978, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland became Pope John Paul II; in 2005, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany became Pope Benedict XVI; and in 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina became Pope Francis, the church’s first pontiff from the Americas.\n\nNow, along with Italy, this cycle’s papabile – those considered most “pope-able” – includes front-runners from Africa and Asia. As of May 1, according to British bookmaker William Hill, Italy’s Parolin is a 9/4 favorite, followed by Tagle of the Philippines at 3/1. Ghanian prelate Peter Turkson and Matteo Zuppi, the Italian archbishop of Bologna, follow at 6/1.\n\n“Everybody thinks they know about sports, but who knows about picking popes?” Ordine said. “It’s not an event about which a lot of people bring a lot of knowledge to. Like, who’s thinking, ‘Which of these cardinals has the most ecclesiastic chops to be the pope?’ It’s the kind of wager people would make lightheartedly. You’re basically throwing darts.”\n\nBreeding a climate of 'rumor and turmoil'\n\nHistorians say papal gambling dates back at least to the 1400s and was rampant in 16th-century Rome. And the bets weren't just about papal elections, either.\n\nA paper published in 2015 by the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas notes: \"For example, throughout the entire first half of 1584, Rome remained stirred by the possibility that Gregory XIII would make an important trip to his hometown of Bologna. Brokers took bets on whether he would go or not, when he would go, and for how long he would go.\"\n\nThe era foretold the betting-obsessed culture of today, wrote John Hunt, the paper’s author and an assistant professor of history and political science at Utah Valley University in Orem. Romans even wagered on women’s pregnancies, with sensali, or brokers, seeking out local expectant mothers and underwriting bets on what the sex of the child would be.\n\nVatican happenings were no different, as Romans put money down not only on conclave selections but cardinal appointments and papal activities as well. In 1588, \"Brokers also took bets on whether Sixtus V wouldmake a trip to Loreto to visit its popular Marian shrine.\"\n\nA Venetian ambassador’s report in 1550 described what could be called an early instance of insider trading after the death of Pope Paul III, with the situation “more than clear that the merchants are very well informed about the state of the poll, and that the cardinals’ attendants in the conclave go partners with them in wagers.”\n\nThat’s likely why cardinals refrained from denouncing the practice despite the “rumor and turmoil” it stirred up, Hunt wrote: “On one hand, they could condemn the pernicious effects it had on the election; on the other, many actively participated in the wagering.”\n\nBy 1591, the newly installed Pope Gregory XIV had had enough of the cardinal sinning, banning the practice under penalty of excommunication. The edict was abrogated in 1918, according to canon law expert Edward Peters of Detroit’s Sacred Heart Major Seminary.\n\nAnyway, such threats only served to push the practice underground, at least for a few centuries. A National Bureau of Economic Research paper published in 2008 noted press coverage of betting activity around Vatican conclaves in 1878, 1903 and 1922.\n\nWith the passing of Pope John Paul II in 2005, “the chance to bet on the papal election seemed to catch the imagination of the whole world,” Irish bookmaker Paddy Power told the BBC, calling it “the biggest non-sports betting market of all time.”\n\nIn 2013, Pope Benedict XVI resigned his papacy citing age and ailing health. Ghana’s Peter Turkson, the initial favorite at 11-4, ultimately saw the throne of St. Peter go to a 33-1 longshot, Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina.\n\n“This is one of the most unpredictable markets in betting,” wrote Online Betting Guide's Ashton. “Surprises can and do happen during a conclave.”\n\nConclave betting options limited in U.S.\n\nCompared to the United States, sports gambling is much more accepted in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where the activity is much more entrenched, Ordine said.\n\n“European sportsbooks are way out in front in terms of maturation of that industry,” he said. That has begun to change: In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) banning sports betting outside of Nevada, opening the door for sites such as FanDuel and DraftKings.\n\n“Betting in generally has become more culturally acceptable and more in the mainstream than it was when Pope Francis was selected,” Ordine said. “The rise of online sports betting has done a lot to change the view of gambling in America.”\n\nBut while papal elections offers “the patina of sports gambling,” similar to predicting the top pick in the NFL draft, “these types of events are not the kind of proposition that casinos take bets on,” Ordine said. “You can’t gamble on elections in this country.”\n\nAccording to Sportsbook Review, a sportsbook and betting analysis website, betting on the papal conclave is among events that “fall squarely outside the scope of regulated sports betting,” an area restricted to athletic competition as well as certain awards and entertainment-related situations.\n\nJim Strode, an associate professor of business at Ohio University in Athens, said while pro sports leagues have rules to prevent information leaks, “states that allow for sports betting do not include betting on any markets outside of sports, as there are so many uncertainties and potential inside-information-sharing that cannot be controlled.”\n\nThat’s not to say speculators are necessarily out of luck, though the options are not without controversy. Prediction market platforms such as Kalshi and crypto-based Polymarket act more as betting exchanges for current events rather than licensed sportsbooks; users purchase contracts, similar to buying stocks, instead of making wagers.\n\nBoth sites have made inroads in the U.S. after a federal appeals court ruled in October that Kalshi could allow Americans to bet on the 2024 election, though some states have since struck back with cease-and-desist letters. Meanwhile, sports business site Sportico quoted the American Gaming Association as saying such platforms “appear to circumvent state regulatory frameworks.”\n\nStill, Ordine thinks most wagering on the conclave is likely to happen informally among friends, similar to the squares people play for the Super Bowl.\n\n“It’ll be next to nothing, relatively speaking,” Ordine said. “In terms of comparison to the Super Bowl or March Madness where billions of dollars are at stake, this is really going to be nickels and dimes. With the Super Bowl, people are even betting on the color of Gatorade poured on the coach at the end of the game. Picking the pope is not going to be anywhere near that.”\n\nIn 2013, Religion News Service conducted a “Sweet Sistine” bracket competition that let readers choose the favorite of 16 top candidates, none of which was Pope Francis.\n\nWhich just goes to show it’s anyone’s guess.\n\n“It’s the type of wager people can make without investing a lot of ego into it,” Ordine said. “When you’re betting on football games, you’re putting your knowledge on the line and when you don’t do well it’s a reflection on you. But putting a couple of dollars down on the next pope – it’s not as if you’ve suffered a dent in your ego if you’re wrong.”\n\nKenneth Pennington, professor emeritus of ecclesiastical and legal history at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., said if he were a betting man, he would lay odds on Erdo, of Hungary.\n\n“He had dinner at our home in D.C. a few years ago, and I would love to brag about that,” Pennington said. “But he is a very long shot.”\n\nAnother trending candidate has been Cardinal Robert Sarah of Nigeria, a favorite of American conservatives whose odds are listed as 8-1 by William Hill Sportsbook.\n\nHowever, Chesnut, of Virginia Commonwealth, doubts Sarah or any other major conservative has much chance given that Pope Francis, a liberal reformer, handpicked 80% of the conclave’s voting cardinals.\n\n“Twelve years ago, I was the only major papal observer who called (that it would be) a Latin American pope,” Chesnut said. “I even got hate mail: ‘What does Chesnut know?’ But actually, I thought it was going to be a Brazilian.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/03"}]}

In 1966, the NFL and the American Football League (AFL) agreed to have a big playoff game between the best teams of each league (think DC superheroes vs. Marvel superheroes but with a football).\n\nIn 1967, they held the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, continuing the fine American tradition of \"world\" championships limited to the United States. Within a few years, the game became known as the Super Bowl and it just got bigger and bigger.\n\nAfter the two leagues merged in 1970 to become the current NFL, it then split into two conferences, the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference. Two teams from the old NFL (Steelers and Colts) moved into the AFC. There is also the United Football League, another pro league with no affiliation which started in its current form in 2024, but they're not involved here.\n\nThe winning team gets the Vince Lombardi trophy, named after the coach of the Green Bay Packers, the team that won the first two Super Bowls.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs (AFC winner) face off against the Philadelphia Eagles (NFC winner).\n\nThe Chiefs have red helmets, the Eagles' helmets are green, if that helps.\n\nThis will be the Chiefs’ third-straight Super Bowl appearance (they won the last two) and a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years ago.\n\nWhen is the 2025 Super Bowl?\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl will take place on Sunday, February 9, with kickoff scheduled at 6:30 p.m. EST, but with hours of pregame coverage before then.\n\nSuper Bowls were traditionally held in January but got moved to the first Sunday in February due to an expanded season. Since 2002, Super Bowls are played on the second Sunday in February.\n\nAs of Sunday night, the cheapest Super Bowl ticket on StubHub a seat in section 649, row 19 for $5,346. Ticketmaster has four seats listed at $64,900 each (before fees) that would put you at the front barricade of section 146 behind the Eagles' sidelines.\n\nSo, somewhere between those.\n\nWhat channel is the Super Bowl on in 2025? Can I stream the Super Bowl?\n\nIt will be aired on Fox and Fox Deportes.\n\nThe game will be live-streamed on FoxSports.com and the Fox Sports app. Live TV streaming services YouTube TV and Hulu Plus Live TV will also feature the Super Bowl via Fox. Super Bowl 59 also can be streamed live on fuboTV, DirecTV Stream and Sling TV.\n\nWhere is Super Bowl 59 being held?\n\nThe Super Bowl in 2025 will be played at the home of the New Orleans Saints: Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.\n\nWho was in the Super Bowl last year?\n\nThe 2024 Super Bowl featured the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers. The game was an overtime thriller, with the Chiefs coming out on top.\n\nWhy do people keep asking if Taylor Swift was at the game today?\n\nThe mega-pop star is dating Travis Kelce, the Chiefs’ tight end.\n\nShe has shown up at a lot of his games, including Sunday’s victory that put them into the Super Bowl again. Her interest in supporting her boyfriend has resulted in a surge of new interest in the sport from a whole class of fans who hadn’t been watching before.\n\nWhy is it called the Super Bowl, anyway?\n\nBig football playoffs started to be referred to as \"bowls\" after the Pasadena Tournament of Roses in 1923 was held at the new Rose Bowl Stadium which, yes, looked like a bowl. (Not everything in football is complicated).\n\nThat particular game became known as the Rose Bowl, and other football contests — the Orange Bowl in Miami, the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, and more — started using the name to exploit the Rose Bowl's popularity because marketing was a thing then, too.\n\nBut first it was the \"AFL–NFL World Championship Game,\" and in that first year the execs were already looking for a less-cumbersome name for it. Lamar Hunt, then-owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, called the game the Super Bowl in meetings and when talking to the press.\n\nIn a memo to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, he wrote, “I have kiddingly called it the Super Bowl, which obviously can be improved upon.”\n\nRozelle didn't like it. But a local newspaper quoted Hunt, the name caught on, advertisers and fans loved it, and by the third year \"Super Bowl\" had become the official name.\n\nHunt later said he was probably thinking of the Super Ball toy his daughter was playing with, which is why (this is true) if you go to the Pro Football Hall of Fame you'll see a toy rubber ball proudly on display.\n\nWhy do Super Bowls use Roman numerals? What does LIX mean?\n\nThat was Lamar Hunt's idea, too. According to the NFL: \"The Roman numerals were adopted to clarify any confusion that may occur because the NFL Championship Game — the Super Bowl — is played in the year following a chronologically recorded season. Numerals I through IV were added later for the first four Super Bowls.\"\n\nAnd they added pomp and gravitas and a gladiatorial feel, which Hunt liked, something that helped establish this unknown new game as a major event.\n\nRemember hearing about Roman numerals in high school and then never ever thinking about them again, except maybe while watching movie credits? L stands for 50, X means 10, and I is one (but in roman numerals the I before the X makes it 10 minus one, or 9), so this means this year's game is Super Bowl 59.\n\nWhy not just call it Super Bowl 59? Too late now, the tradition is locked in.\n\nHow many people watch the Super Bowl?\n\nIt is impossible to overestimate the popularity and cultural impact of the Super Bowl.\n\nLast year's Super Bowl had an estimated 123.7 million viewers on CBS, the biggest audience in history for a single network, with another 2.3 million watching on Univision and 1.2 million on Nickelodeon.\n\nAccording to the NFL, over 202.4 million people tuned in for some part of Super Bowl LVIII when you add in streaming viewers, and that's just counting the legal ones. In comparison, the Apollo 11 moon landing had an audience of 125-150 million.\n\nIt's also one of the biggest sources of absenteeism in the U.S. In a 2021 report, the Workforce Institute estimated that 16.1 million employees said they planned to miss work on the Monday after Super Bowl LV, with 8.8 million taking paid time off and 4.4 million admitting they were already planning their sick day.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, a company that has been measuring television audiences since the 50s, 27 of the 30 most-watched single-network television broadcasts of all time have been Super Bowls.\n\nThis explains the ads.\n\nWhy are Super Bowl ads so popular?\n\nFor a lot of people the whole purpose of the Super Bowl each year is to provide a venue and excuse for the Super Bowl ads.\n\nBecause of the massive audience, networks can command the highest rates for advertising (and they do). In return, advertisers take the opportunity to present their strangest, funniest, sexiest, most heartwarming and above all most-sharable ads before, during and after the Super Bowl. The ads, often shot with production values rivaling movies and filled with A-list celebrities, have become a cultural icon of their own, with people searching out the commercials on YouTube and media sites.\n\nThis year Fox is charging a record $7 million for a 30-second ad, according to Sports Illustrated, or $233,000 a second, and the available slots sold out a week after Halloween.\n\nFans can expect to see Drew Barrymore and Orlando Bloom talking about MSC Cruises, Marvel stars Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt advertising Meta’s Smart Glasses, Willam Defoe and Catherine O’Hara playing pickleball with athletes for Michelob Ultra, rapper Doja Cat expounding on her love of Taco Bell, a hinted-ad reunion of “When Harry Met Sally” stars Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, and more.\n\nWho's performing at Super Bowl 2025?\n\nEven people who hate football will tune in for the halftime show, which famously brings in some of the world's biggest stars for the biggest one-show audience most of them will ever have. Previous halftime performers have included the Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga, U2, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Madonna, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Michael Jackson, and Prince.\n\nThis year, Grammy and Oscar award-winner Jon Baptiste will perform the national anthem and nine-time Grammy award-winner Kendrick Lamar will perform at halftime with SZA.\n\nWhat is the Superb Owl?\n\nThe annual Superb Owl migration has two sources.\n\nEvery year, as the big game approaches, people googling for information often put the space in the wrong place and searches for \"superb owl\" spike in the beginning of February, providing puzzled football fans everything they ever wanted to know about the nocturnal avian creatures. In previous years Google has capitalized on this, offering Super Bowl information anyway with owls added to team logos.\n\nAnd the NFL cracks down hard on any sources (besides media and sports coverage) that try to use their heavily trademarked, copyrighted \"Super Bowl\" name for, well, practically everything. Advertisers trying to get the attention of football fans instead call it The Big Game or the Championship Game to avoid dark-suited people with menacing briefcases.\n\nIn 2014 Stephen Colbert used \"Superb Owl\" coverage in his ongoing sports segments on \"The Colbert Report\" but it was already a social media inside joke for people mocking the NFL's heavy-handed cease & desist letters. The \"Superb Owl\" Reddit group (/r/superbowl), created in 2011 and now boasting over 400,000 members, limits all posts to be owl-related. \"Superb Owl\" was even a Jeopardy category in 2019.\n\nNow every February your Twitter feed will slowly fill with owl pictures. Just accept it.\n\nWhat are Super Bowl squares? How do Super Bowl squares work? How do you play?\n\nWhen the biggest football game of the year just isn't interesting enough, you can add your own game to it. Super Bowl squares is random, gives you something to talk about during the slow bits, and you can win money at it.\n\nSuper Bowl squares is a game played with a 10x10 grid of 100 squares with a different team's name on the left side and the top. Each square has a price. If it's a buck per, $5 lets you put your initials on five squares, $10 gets you 10, and so on. At this point, no one has any idea what numbers will end up on which square so no actual skill or football knowledge is required.\n\nNow randomly assign the numbers 0-9 to the tops of all the columns and the side of each of the rows (just pick 'em, or use one of the many random number generators online). You now have a grid where every square is the intersection of two numbers.\n\nAt the end of the game, check the score. For example, if you initialed a box that lined up at Chiefs 6 and Eagles 2, and the score ended in Chiefs something-6 and the Eagles something-2 (only the last number of the score counts), you win the pot. You also can split it up by checking score at the end of every quarter with part of the payout going to that winner.\n\nJames H.

After a busy weekend at his private club, Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, President Donald Trump took Air Force One to Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome stadium in New Orleans with some of his family members in tow. Donald Trump is the first sitting U.S. president in history to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nHis appearance at the Super Bowl is not the only Trump-Super Bowl tie: Every year, Donald and Melania Trump host a Super Bowl watch party at his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course, Trump International Golf Club. It includes big screens galore for the game, food, drinks, entertainment and typically musical performances from Florida Atlantic University.\n\nIn his first term, Trump returned to Palm Beach each Super Bowl weekend where he attended his Super Bowl watch party at Trump International Golf Club, 3505 Summit Blvd., West Palm Beach.\n\nWas First Lady Melania Trump at Super Bowl 2025 in New Orleans?\n\nNo, First Lady Melania Trump did not attend Super Bowl LIX (aka Super Bowl 59 or Super Bowl 2025) in New Orleans, Louisiana, with her husband, President Donald Trump.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., eldest son of Donald Trump and the late Ivana Trump, attended Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, according to his Instagram feed. He shared video of the Caesars Superdome stadium field before the start of the Philadelphia Eagles-Kansas City Chiefs game as an Instagram Story and Instagram Reel to his 8.8 million followers. After he briefly livestreamed the Super Bowl Half-time show, Donald Trump Jr. posted photos on Instagram of three of his five children with ex-wife Vanessa Trump: Donald Trump III, Spencer Frederick Trump and Chloe Sofia Trump. The Instagram Live and some of the Instagram photos feature Donald Trump Jr.’s new girlfriend, Bettina Anderson.\n\nMeanwhile, Kimberly Guilfoyle, former fiancee of Donald Trump Jr. and a member of Donald Trump's inner circle − he appointed the former Fox News host as the U.S. ambassador to Greece − also attended the Super Bowl. Guilfoyle, who dated Donald Trump Jr. for six years before their breakup in 2024, snapped a photo with several celebrities in the VIP box: Academy Award winning actor Kevin Costner, \"Saturday Night Live\" actor Pete Davidson and actor Jaleel White, who played Steve Urkel in \"Family Matters.\"\n\nGuilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. lived together in the exclusive Admiral's Cove neighborhood in Jupiter, Florida. News reports suggest the couple split in 2024. Photos surfaced online in December 2024 of Donald Trump Jr. kissing and holding hands with model socialite Bettina Anderson of Palm Beach, Florida. Guilfoyle was appointed her ambassadorship days after the Bettina Anderson-Donald Trump Jr. photos were published on tabloid sites.\n\nDid Bettina Anderson attend the Super Bowl with Donald Trump Jr.? The model, who has almost 64,000 followers on Instagram as of Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 9, 2025, posted photos on her Instagram Story of the Caesars Superdome field and a \"bathroom selfie.\" Her selfie/Instagram Story \"football fit\" photo post tagged Balmain, Alive + Olivia and Forever 21. It also had a play on words for the Trump family: \"Make bathroom selfies great again (OK hand emoji)\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr.’s photos of Anderson and his children on his social feed marks the first time the president’s son has posted about his romantic relationship with her — a phenomenon called “Instagram official.” The couple has attended high-profile events such as Donald and Melania Trump’s New Year’s Eve 2024 party at Mar-a-Lago or Inauguration Day festivities in Washington, D.C., but his Super Bowl Sunday photos with Anderson and his children in the Trump VIP box are the first he has publicly posted.\n\nWas Ivanka Trump at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans?\n\nPresident Donald Trump's oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, attended Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans and stood next to her father in the VIP box.

A former senior adviser to Donald Trump during his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021, Ivanka Trump, who's married to Jared Kushner, brought their youngest son, Theodore James Kushner, to the Super Bowl. The proud mom posted on her Instagram Story on Super Bowl Sunday video of her youngest playing football: \"Theo gearing up for tonight's big game by showing off his wheels! Quarterback keeper to the house!\"\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner are parents to three children, Arabella Rose Kushner, Joseph Frederick Kushner and Theodore James Kushner.\n\nWas Eric Trump at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans?\n\nYes.

It was the most powerful hurricane to ever strike the island nation, bringing torrential rains and damaging winds, which left hundreds of thousands without power, destroyed homes and scattered fields with debris. It next made landfall in Cuba as a Category 3 storm before going through the Bahamas and passing near Bermuda.\n\nThe death toll in the Caribbean climbed to more than 60 on Nov. 1, after the Jamaican government confirmed 28 deaths on the island in an X post shared by Prime Minister Andrew Holness. Deaths also were reported in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, including in areas that did not experience a direct landfall, but saw severe flooding from the slow-moving storm. In a statement, Jamaican officials said additional reports of possible fatalities are still being verified.\n\n\"Every single life lost is a huge tragedy,\" said Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaican minister of education, skills, youth and information, at a news conference on Oct. 31. \"We have never had a Category 5 hurricane in our country. The devastation in the west is unimaginable.\"\n\nThe storm, which dissipated to a post-tropical cyclone on Oct. 31, was passing by the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, early in the morning of Nov. 1, the Canadian weather service said.\n\nDeath toll rises to over 50 from ex-Hurricane Melissa\n\nMore than 50 deaths have been blamed on Melissa as of the morning of Nov. 1.\n\nDixon, the minister in Jamaica, said on Oct. 31 that 19 deaths have been confirmed there, but that number is expected to increase as authorities confirm additional reports of deaths.\n\nAt least 31 people were killed in Haiti, which wasn't hit directly by Melissa but which suffered extensive flooding and heavy rainfall for days. At least 23 of those deaths, including 10 children, were the result of flooding in the coastal town of Petit-Goâve, where a river burst its banks.\n\nAt least two deaths were reported in the Dominican Republic, including one person who died before the storm made landfall, according to the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nJamaica surveys Melissa's devastation: 'Apocalyptic'\n\nOn Oct. 31, authorities in Jamaica said they were working to deliver food and other aid to people devastated by Melissa and recover the bodies of additional people reported dead, using helicopters to reach areas with impassable roads. The country's works department had made some progress clearing thoroughfares, Dixon said.\n\nSome 462,000 people remained without power, she said.\n\nDesmond McKenzie, the country's minister of local government and community development, said communications were still knocked out in five parishes on Oct. 31. In Falmouth, the capital of the Trelawney Parish along the northwestern coast, \"it is not a pretty reading,\" he said.\n\n\"The municipal building has been destroyed. The infirmary: destroyed. The roads and works department: destroyed. The courthouse: destroyed,\" McKenzie said.\n\n\"The situation on the ground is what can only be described as apocalyptic,\" World Food Programme Caribbean director Brian Bogart said at a news conference in Black River, Jamaica, near Melissa's landfall. \"It appears as if a bomb has gone off in that community and people are still in shock.\"\n\nHospitals destroyed, health care workers traumatized in Jamaica\n\nJamaican health officials said the nation's health care system has been severely impacted in the storm. Five major hospitals had to halt or relocate many services after sustaining major damage, including one in St. Elizabeth that suffered a roof collapse, according to Christopher Tufton, the minister of health and wellness of Jamaica.\n\nHealth care workers who were on duty while the hurricane passed have been marooned in and in some cases cut off from their home communities, Tufton said.\n\n\"Health workers have been victims of this tragedy also,\" he said. \"Some of them had to man their stations, not knowing what was happening to their homes, to their loved ones.\"\n\nHospitals that weren't as seriously impacted are seeing an influx of patients coming from areas with hospitals that are inoperable or seriously limited, Tufton said. As Jamaicans work to recover from the devastation and clean up damage, they are also coming into emergency departments with injuries from falls off roofs or ladders or nails penetrating their feet.\n\n\"They're really trying to pick up the pieces and in doing so, it’s creating some accidents,\" he said.\n\nTufton also put out a call for desperately needed blood donations and warned that officials are concerned about illnesses related to food contamination as people go without electricity and refrigeration. Also a concern: contaminated water and an increase of mosquitoes and rodents due to standing water.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver and Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/10/31/hurricane-melissa-caribbean-live-updates/86995237007/", "title": "Death toll climbs to 50 in the Caribbean as remnants of Hurricane ...", "text": "Oct. 31, 2025 Updated Nov. 1, 2025, 11:18 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's note: This page summarizes Hurricane Melissa news for Friday, Oct. 31. For the latest news on Hurricane Melissa, please visit USA TODAY's coverage for Saturday, Nov. 1.\n\nCommunities across the northern Caribbean are reeling in the aftermath of former Hurricane Melissa on Friday after the storm left a trail of devastation as it tore through the region as one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record.\n\nThe ex-hurricane brought torrential rains and damaging winds, which left hundreds of thousands without power, destroyed homes and scattered fields with debris. Though rescue and recovery operations were underway, efforts continued to be hindered by widespread power outages and blocked roads.\n\nIn Jamaica, local authorities said crews and residents were working to assist with relief support. Desmond McKenzie, the country's minister of local government and community development, previously said over 170 communities across six parishes were moderately or severely affected by the storm.\n\n\"We have never had a Category 5 hurricane in our country. The devastation in the west is unimaginable,\" said Jamaican Minister of Education, Skills, Youth and Information Dana Morris Dixon at a news conference Friday.\n\nIn Cuba and Haiti, heavy rainfall caused extensive damage. According to Francisco Pichon, resident coordinator for Cuba at the United Nations, more than 200 communities remained isolated and without communications due to flooding and landslides. The former hurricane unleashed catastrophic flooding in Haiti, damaging homes and forcing thousands of people into emergency shelters.\n\nOfficials across the region said they expected the death toll to rise as they continued to verify reported deaths and search for missing people. By Thursday night, at least 50 deaths had been attributed to the storm. In Jamaica, 19 deaths have been confirmed but the number is expected to increase, Dixon said Friday.\n\nAt least 50 deaths reported in Haiti, Jamaica, Dominican Republic after ex-Hurricane Melissa\n\nAuthorities in Haiti, which was not directly hit by the former hurricane but was battered with days of rainfall, said Thursday that at least 30 people were killed in the storm and 20 more were missing. At least 23 people, including 10 children, died due to floods in Petit-Goâve, a coastal town about 40 miles west of the capital, where a river burst its banks.\n\nIn Jamaica, at least 19 people were killed in the storm, officials confirmed Friday, but the death toll is expected to rise as authorities confirm additional death reports. Local officials previously said they had dedicated a helicopter to the recovery of bodies and authorities were continuing search and rescue efforts.\n\n\"These are Jamaicans who we are so devastated to know that they have lost their lives. Every single life lost is a huge tragedy,\" Dixon said.\n\nAt least two deaths were reported in the Dominican Republic, including one person who died before the storm made landfall, according to the Pan American Health Organization. Before landfall, authorities also reported the storm caused three deaths in Jamaica and three in Haiti.\n\nMelissa weakens and retreats from Bermuda\n\nFriday morning, Melissa barreled away from Bermuda after making its closest approach at about 2 a.m. ET, reaching about 150 miles north-northwest from land as a Category 1 storm with hurricane-force wind gusts reaching Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBy 11 a.m., Melissa was downgraded to a \"powerful\" post-tropical cyclone packing 85 mph winds and retreating to the northeast at 48 mph.\n\nMelissa is expected to make a gradual slowdown and turn to the east-northeast over the weekend and weaken further over the next few days.\n\nJamaica works to deliver food, clear roads\n\nJamaican officials said on Friday its works department had made progress on clearing key roads to allow first responders to access communities hit by Melissa.\n\nAdditional resources, including helicopters, have arrived in Jamaica that will be used to deliver food and other aid to impacted communities that are difficult to reach, Dixon said. Dixon previously pledged the Jamaican government would continue working until it reaches every person who needs help.\n\n\"There are many individuals who are not hearing from their families because of the communication break,\" she added.\n\nMelissa to impact Atlantic Canada, Northeast US next\n\nPost-Tropical Cyclone Melissa is expected to pass to the south of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, Canada, on Friday night, the hurricane center said. It will also reach about 580 miles from Nantucket, Massachusetts, later Friday.\n\nSwells generated by the storm will impact the Northeast U.S. coast and Atlantic Canada and persist into the weekend, bringing life-threatening rip currents and surf conditions, forecasters said.\n\nMelissa will bring \"significant risks to lives, property and business operations\" in Newfoundland, AccuWeather reported.\n\nFormer Hurricane Melissa is influencing North Carolina ocean conditions\n\nLong period waves from ex-Hurricane Melissa are forecast to bring large surf to North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Friday.\n\nA significant wave run up may result in the ocean reaching past the dunes in vulnerable locations, said the National Weather Service in Morehead City.\n\nOnly isolated road closures are expected, the weather service said.\n\nFive houses collapsed in Buxton, North Carolina, this week and officials at Cape Hatteras National Seashore has reported other homes remain at risk.\n\nA high risk of rip currents is forecast along the Outer Banks and North Carolina coast on Friday from North Topsail Beach to Duck.\n\nBecause of Melissa’s angle as it moves away into the North Atlantic, its swell is not expected to affect the New England coast, said Joe Dellicarpini, a meteorologist with the weather service in Boston.\n\nDozens of health centers impacted by Melissa, organization says\n\nClinics and hospitals in Jamaica sustained \"extensive damage\" when Melissa roared through the island nation, and dozens of health centers in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic were impacted, according to a report from the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nThe hardest-hit hospitals were all in the western half of the island, according to the report. Black River Hospital in St. Elizabeth, Jamaica, is inoperable with its roof collapsed, walls damaged and extensive flooding, the report said. Falmouth Hospital in Trelawny was severely damaged from storm surge flooding, while Noel Holmes in Hanover and Cornwall Regional in St. James were both damaged and had services relocated.\n\nFive hospitals in Jamaica have reopened for full services and several other health centers began delivering services during limited hours on Thursday, government officials said in an update. Other hospitals are in \"emergency mode,\" providing critical and life-saving care only.\n\nHere's how you can help Caribbean nations devastated by Hurricane Melissa\n\nHumanitarian organizations have begun mobilizing to provide immediate relief and prepare for long-term recovery after the storm.\n\nYou can help with donations and other forms of support for organizations, including American Friends of Jamaica, the American Red Cross, Americares, CARE, Global Giving, the Salvation Army, and several others.

For the latest news on Hurricane Melissa, please visit USA TODAY's coverage for Friday, Oct. 31.\n\nParts of the Caribbean are conducting search and rescue operations and surveying the extensive destruction Hurricane Melissa brought to the region, leaving dozens of people dead and drawing an outpouring of support from the international community.\n\nMelissa tore through the Caribbean as one of the most powerful storms in recorded history and made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a deadly Category 5 hurricane. By Thursday, the storm had further weakened as it moved over the southeastern Bahamas and toward Bermuda, about 500 miles off the U.S. East Coast.\n\nThe hardest-hit areas include Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti, where damaging winds and severe flooding from storm surge and days of rainfall destroyed homes and tore down utility poles.\n\nRescue and recovery operations are hampered by widespread power outages, communications failures, and blocked roads. The death toll is growing — with more than 50 deaths attributed to the storm in Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic — as authorities continued to verify reported deaths.\n\n\"There are entire communities that seem to be marooned and also areas that have been flattened,\" said Jamaican Minister of Education, Skills, Youth, and Information Dana Dixon. \"We are trying to get to the areas that have been marooned. We will get there... we are going to get to every single Jamaican and give them support.”\n\n“The entire Jamaica is really broken because of what has happened, but we remain resilient,\" Dixon said.\n\nCountries, including the United States, have pledged support in the form of cash, food aid, and rescue teams. On Thursday, an Urban Search and Rescue team from Fairfax, Virginia, posted photos on social media as the team flew out to Jamaica as part of the U.S. State Department's post-hurricane response to the country.\n\nSee satellite images: Hurricane Melissa's devastation in Jamaica\n\nOver 50 deaths reported in Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic\n\nAuthorities in Haiti, which was battered with days of rain, said Thursday that at least 30 people were killed in the storm and 20 more were missing. At least 23 people, including 10 children, died due to floods in Petit-Goâve, a coastal town about 40 miles west of the capital, where a river burst its banks.\n\nIn Jamaica, officials said they had dedicated a helicopter to the recovery of bodies. The country's information minister told Reuters on Thursday that at least 19 people were killed in the storm.\n\nDesmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of local government and community development, acknowledged during a news briefing earlier in the day that there were casualties and the number was expected to rise. He urged the public to wait for official confirmation from local authorities.\n\nAt least two deaths were reported in the Dominican Republic, including one person who died before the storm made landfall, according to the Pan American Health Organization. Before landfall, authorities also reported the storm caused three deaths in Jamaica and three in Haiti.\n\nNo deaths were reported in Cuba as of Thursday, but authorities said the island had suffered severe damage. According to Francisco Pichon, resident coordinator for Cuba at the United Nations, more than 200 communities are entirely cut off by flooding and landslides, so more information about potential casualties would be forthcoming as responders access them.\n\nPower outages, widespread damage reported in hard-hit Jamaica\n\nOver 70% of electrical customers in Jamaica remained without power as of Thursday morning, said the country's Energy Minister Daryl Vaz. Many schools remained without power or water, officials said.\n\nAerial footage and photos showed downed power lines strewn across the island's roadways. More than 130 roads remained blocked by trees and debris, authorities said.\n\nMembers of the Jamaica Defence Force cleared roadways on foot into isolated areas as ambulances followed close behind. One road in the hard-hit coastal town of Black River was swamped with more than four feet of sand stretching over a mile, according to officials.\n\nIn a neighborhood of the island's Montego Bay, 77-year-old Alfred Hines waded barefoot through thick mud and debris as he described his narrow escape from the rising floodwaters.\n\n\"At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape,\" he told Reuters. \"I just want to forget it and things come back to normal.\"\n\nSearch and rescue teams from the United States were heading to Jamaica on Thursday to assist in recovery efforts, authorities said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was prepared to offer \"immediate humanitarian aid\" to the people of Cuba.\n\nDelivery of relief supplies, access for emergency vehicles\n\nJamaican officials are using helicopters to deliver relief supplies and transfer patients to other hospitals, Dixon and others said during a news conference. In some locations, helicopters have been unable to find clear spots to land, she said.\n\nDixon also described grueling work being done in some locations to clear roads to allow access for emergency vehicles, such as crews using machetes to cut through bamboo plants.\n\nOfficials also described a great anxiety and uncertainty among island residents who have been unable to contact family members in some of the hardest-hit and flooded areas. Some airports were reopened on Thursday for relief flights.\n\nBermuda prepares for Hurricane Melissa's approach\n\nBermuda was preparing on Thursday for Melissa to pass nearby to its west overnight. Hurricane- and tropical storm-force winds extend far out from its center and will still reach Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nConditions are expected to \"rapidly deteriorate\" in Bermuda through the evening on Thursday, with strong winds, hazardous seas, and dangerous rip currents. At 11 p.m. ET, Melissa had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and was centered about 160 miles west-southwest of Bermuda, the hurricane center said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect, and forecasters warned that \"preparations should be rushed to completion\" before tropical storm-force winds reach Bermuda.\n\nThe country expected to close its causeway Thursday night and shutter schools and ferries on Friday \"out of an abundance of caution,\" National Security Minister Michael Weeks said in a statement. \"I implore all residents to remain vigilant while we navigate another natural threat to our way of life,\" he said.\n\nA statement from the Bermuda Tourism Authority emphasized the country's track record of hurricane resilience and advised tourists to follow official updates and contact travel providers with questions about any changes in operations. The Bermuda Hotel Association offers a ‘Hurricane Guarantee’ for travelers that offers penalty-free cancellations when itineraries are disrupted by hurricanes, the authority stated.\n\nEven as Bermuda battened down for its own brush with Melissa, Premier David Burt pledged the country’s support for Jamaica, which he termed “a resilient country with a proud history” and a strong connection to Bermuda.\n\n“The path to recovery and rebuilding will be a long process and we will continue to work with the Government and people of Jamaica to help where we can,” Burt stated. “We will play our part as that resilience is tested and join the regional and international effort to aid the recovery.”\n\nMelissa could graze Canada on its way out to sea\n\nAfter zooming by Bermuda, Melissa will continue northeast, passing the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland on Saturday morning as an \"extratropical\" hurricane-strength storm, according to Houston-based meteorologist Matt Lanza on his blog \"The Eyewall.\" That means it won't be classified as a hurricane.\n\n\"On the current track, forecast impacts would be mostly minor to moderate in southeast Newfoundland and the Avalon Peninsula, with the worst of the storm remaining offshore,\" he said. \"If for some reason the storm tracks closer to Atlantic Canada, impacts would worsen in Newfoundland. As of now, this looks like a manageable storm, albeit one with the usual hazards from gusty winds to heavy rain to rough seas and high tides in Newfoundland.\"\n\nUS East Coast could see 'life-threatening' surf from Melissa\n\nDespite being far out to sea, Melissa could still impact beachgoers along the U.S. East Coast.\n\nOcean swells generated by Melissa are \"likely to reach the coast of the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada Friday and persist into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nMeteorologist: Climate change likely a factor in Melissa's rapid intensification\n\nMelissa rapidly intensified last weekend from a tropical storm to a ferocious major hurricane in less than a day, which many scientists say is a clear signal of human-caused climate change due to the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nWhy is this? Climate change increases the rapid intensification of hurricanes by making ocean waters warmer, which provides more fuel for storms. Hurricanes gain strength as they move over warm seawater.\n\n\"Increasing the amount of heat in the ocean increases the odds of rapid intensification, with the largest increases in peak intensification rates occurring for the most extreme cases,\" noted meteorologist Jeff Masters on the Yale Climate Connections blog in August.\n\nIn addition, air that's warmer holds more moisture and warmer oceans reduce wind shear, allowing storms to strengthen more quickly and become more powerful.\n\nAll of this leads to a higher probability of rapid intensification and a greater number of more intense hurricanes.\n\nOne study from 2024, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the world’s most intense hurricanes are growing even more intense, fueled by rising temperatures in the ocean and atmosphere.\n\nAmerican tourist remains stranded in Jamaica\n\nTourists who were unable to leave Jamaica before Melissa hit experienced the storm’s full force and are now stranded on the island due to flight cancellations.\n\nJen Eley, a teacher from Silver Spring, Maryland, was on vacation at the RIU Aquarelle resort in Falmouth, Jamaica, when the storm hit. Falmouth is in northwestern Jamaica.\n\n\"I went to Jamaica with a friend to celebrate her birthday,\" she said via text on Thursday. \"We arrived on Thursday and were set to leave on Monday.\n\n\"Once the storm finally started, there was a lot of wind and rain. We boarded up the balcony door/window in our room with the bed's box spring, the dresser, and couch. During the storm we heard a lot of commotion in the hallways, I'm assuming from the wind and debris.\"\n\nShe said that at one point, everything went silent for about 90 minutes, then the wind picked up again \"and we could feel the building swaying. After the rain stopped, there was a strange howling sound from the wind that was loud, constant, and all night long.\"\n\nEley said she's still not sure when she'll return to the United States – spotty cell service and internet access have made it difficult to book another return flight.\n\nState department issues declaration of humanitarian need for Cuba after Hurricane Melissa\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement on Thursday regarding Melissa’s devastation of eastern Cuba. The Trump administration “stands with the brave Cuban people who continue to struggle to meet basic needs,” stated Rubio, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba in 1956.\n\nAs in neighboring communities, the state department is issuing a declaration of humanitarian need for Cuba and is prepared “to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and via local partners who can most effectively deliver it to those in need.”\n\nAlthough the U.S. has an economic embargo against Cuba, there are exemptions and authorizations for private donations of food, medicine, other humanitarian supplies and disaster reply, according to the department’s statement. Anyone who wants to directly support the Cuban people should contact the state department if there are questions or issues at CubaHumanitarian@state.gov.\n\nThe strained relationship between the U.S. and Cuba for more than 60 years has produced a mixed record on offers and acceptance of aid between the two countries.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush's administration declined Cuba’s offer to send doctors to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nAfter Gustav in 2008, the US provided $100,000 in immediate emergency assistance to non-governmental organizations working in humanitarian relief in Cuba. The U.S. also committed to providing up to $5 million in relief assistance to Cuban hurricane victims. But a day after the assistance was offered, the Cuban government declined the offer. Cuba has maintained relief partnerships with other countries.\n\nAfter Category 5 Hurricane Irma struck the island in 2017, the U.S. sent response teams to other Caribbean islands, but did not send a team to Cuba. That's because the smaller country had not made a required request for assistance, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAfter Hurricane Ian in 2022, Cuba’s government requested emergency assistance after the entire island lost electricity. The U.S. said it would provide $2 million for emergency relief through the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nHurricane Melissa has wreaked havoc: Here's how you can help.\n\nHow you can help Caribbean nations devastated by Hurricane Melissa\n\nHumanitarian organizations have begun mobilizing to provide immediate relief and prepare for long-term recovery after the storm.\n\nYou can help with donations and other forms of support for organizations, including American Friends of Jamaica, the American Red Cross, Americares, CARE, Global Giving, the Salvation Army, and several others.

The storm is expected to move northeast out of the Caribbean over the next 5 days and not directly hit the U.S. mainland.\n\nIt's \"looking quite likely we will have several days of flooding and then potentially a devastating core impact near or directly over the island,\" said Andrew Hazelton, an associate scientist at the University of Miami's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, in an Oct. 24 X post.\n\n“Melissa is evolving into a slow-motion disaster,\" said AccuWeather hurricane expert Alex DaSilva on Oct. 24. \"Millions of people are at risk of catastrophic impacts. We are increasingly concerned about the threat of a humanitarian disaster unfolding.”\n\nCaribbean nations at risk\n\nJamaica is expected to see heavy rain. \"Precipitation totals from multiple models suggest that storm totals exceeding 24 inches and localized amounts above 30 inches are quite possible,\" said meteorologists Bob Henson and Jeff Masters in their blog Eye on the Storm.\n\nIn addition, the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola, where Haiti and the Dominican Republic are located, could see flash flooding and landslides into early next week, according to the National Hurricane Center morning discussion on Oct. 25.\n\nIn Jamaica, the National Hurricane Center warned of a multi-day period of damaging winds and heavy rainfall beginning the night of Oct. 25. These effects could cause flash floods and landslides, followed by increasing risks of life-threatening storm surge early next week.\n\nA day earlier, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said residents should prepare to evacuate flood-prone areas. He harkened back to the effects of Hurricane Beryl, which passed south of Jamaica and drenched the island nation.\n\n\"You have been given enough notice that this weather event is coming and it could be disastrous,\" Holness said in a special news briefing. \"Take all measures to protect yourself.\"\n\nHurricanes hit Jamaica about once every 10 or 11 years, on average based on historical data, according to the Jamaican government. Hurricane Gilbert was the strongest recorded to hit Jamaica in 1988, which made landfall as a high-end Category 3.\n\nFifth hurricane of the season\n\nMelissa is the fifth hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, joining Erin, Gabrielle, Humberto and Imelda. A typical season sees seven hurricanes.\n\nIf it becomes a major hurricane (Category 3 and above) as predicted, it will be the fourth such storm this year. Additionally, if it reaches Category 4 strength, it would be the 4th of the first 5 hurricanes of 2025 to become Category 4+, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach on X.\n\nThat's a rare occurrence: \"Only 3 other times on record have 4 of the first 5 Atlantic hurricanes reached Category 4+: In 1932, 1999, and 2010,\" he said.\n\nMost preseason forecasts predicted a busier-than-average season, which hasn't quite panned out as of late October. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season would feature 6-10 hurricanes, of which 3-5 would be major hurricanes.\n\nColorado State University forecasters said that 8 hurricanes would form in 2025, of which 3 would be major.\n\nTrack Hurricane Melissa's path\n\nCould this be the last hurricane of the year? Will the US be spared?\n\n\"With no new storms on the horizon into early November, we can hope Mother Nature has finally given the U.S. a pass after 9 consecutive years of hurricane hits,\" said WPLG-TV hurricane specialist Michael Lowry in a Substack post.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/10/28/hurricane-melissa-jamaica-live-updates/86937563007/", "title": "Hurricane Melissa slams Jamaica, now heading to Cuba: Updates", "text": "Oct. 28, 2025 Updated Oct. 29, 2025, 8:05 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's note: This page summarizes developments on Hurricane Melissa for Tuesday, Oct. 28. For the latest news on Hurricane Melissa, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Wednesday, Oct. 29.\n\nThe center of catastrophic Hurricane Melissa was moving off the Jamaican coast on Tuesday evening, pushing toward Cuba with dangerous winds and storm surge while still pummeling Jamaica in a relentless swath of destruction.\n\nMelissa slammed into the coast near New Hope, about 40 miles south of Montego Bay, with its center marking an official landfall at about 1 p.m. Melissa struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane, with sustained wind speeds of 185 mph and higher gusts, earning a spot in history as one of the most intense storms ever to make landfall in the Atlantic.\n\nIn Jamaica, the entire island \"felt the brunt of Melissa,\" Desmond McKenzie, the island's minister of local government and community development, said during an evening news conference. “Almost every parish is experiencing blocked roads, fallen trees, and utilities poles and excess flooding.\"\n\nThe storm's journey across the island disrupted the hurricane's structure, with a clear eye no longer visible on satellite. The still powerful hurricane had weakened to a Category 4, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 145 mph and higher gusts, according to a 5 p.m. update from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nAfter further weakening to 125 mph as it moved offshore of Jamaica, Melissa had regained sustained winds of 130 mph by 11 p.m. It appeared to be on a re-strengthening trend, and its eye appeared to be growing better defined again, the hurricane center stated.\n\nThe storm, centered about 110 miles southwest of Guantanamo, and about 300 miles south of the Central Bahamas, was expected to strike Cuba within hours. Melissa is expected to sweep across the southeastern and central Bahamas on Oct. 29.\n\nA hurricane warning remains in effect for the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Holguin, and Las Tunas, as well as the central and southeastern Bahamas. By early on the morning of Oct. 31, Melissa is forecast to pass over or near Bermuda with 100 mph winds as it travels quickly to the northeast in the Atlantic.\n\nCuban authorities said they had evacuated about 500,000 people from areas vulnerable to winds and flooding, Reuters reported. \"Melissa will arrive with force, and there's great concern about what it could destroy in its wake,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a message published in state newspaper Granma. He urged people in vulnerable areas to evacuate.\n\nIn the Bahamas, Prime Minister Philip Davis has ordered evacuations for people in the region that could be impacted by Melissa.\n\n'One of its worst periods'\n\n\"Jamaica is going through what I can call one of its worst periods,\" McKenzie said during the news conference. \"Our infrastructure has been severely compromised.\"\n\n“The parish of Saint Elizabeth is under water,” McKenzie said. The parish, known as the country's breadbasket, had \"taken a beating,\" and damage was extensive, he said.\n\nSections of Clarendon Parish were also experiencing severe conditions, and 50 residents of a Santa Cruz infirmary, where care is provided to the poor and needy, had to be relocated, he said. At least three hospitals across the island had been affected by high winds, storm surge, and high water.\n\nSeveral families had been marooned, he said. \"When the parish of Saint Elizabeth was under severe weather, with water as deep as my waist and roofs flying off,\" McKenzie said, a firefighter went to offer assistance, \"but got caught and could not get out.\" At least one of those families had received assistance, but he indicated officials were awaiting further updates. McKenzie said they were praying for no deaths on the island but conditions were still too severe for assessments to be completed.\n\nHurricane Melissa set records See how it compares with historic storms\n\nShortly before landfall, Jamaican electric utility JPS said power outages had affected more than a third of its customers. In its worst-hit parishes, utility provider JPS said some three-quarters of customers lost power, Reuters reported.\n\nJamaican officials said they had made arrangements to bolster the island's communications framework, while health authorities in southeastern Jamaica warned residents to watch out for crocodiles that could be displaced from swamps and rivers.\n\nAt least seven deaths were attributed to Melissa even before its landfall in Jamaica, including three as residents in the island nation prepared for the storm. Torrential downpours were expected to cause flooding and deadly landslides in the island's mountains, where wind speeds were forecast to be as much as 30% higher than at sea level locations.\n\nAs Melissa approached Jamaica on Tuesday morning, the hurricane center had issued a dire warning: \"LAST CHANCE TO PROTECT YOUR LIFE.\"\n\nImpacts 'near the top of what is possible on this planet'\n\nWith its fierce intensification, Melissa became the strongest tropical cyclone of 2025 globally, \"beating out the Western Pacific’s Typhoon Ragasa,\" meteorologist Jeff Masters wrote for Yale Climate Connections on Oct. 27. At least seven deaths in the Caribbean have been blamed on the dangerous hurricane as of Monday.\n\nMelissa's powerful winds left it tied \"with the heavy hitters\" in hurricane history for second strongest winds on record, Phil Klotzbach, a senior hurricane research scientist at Colorado State University, told USA TODAY.\n\nHurricane Melissa is “truly an unprecedented event for the Atlantic Basin, and particularly Jamaica,” said Jeff Waters, director of hurricane models at Moody’s.\n\n“While too early to comment on any economic or insured loss impacts, this will undoubtedly be a generational and humanitarian event for Jamaica and perhaps other impacted areas in the Caribbean,\" Waters said.\n\nWith winds near 250 mph being measured just above the surface, stronger winds would likely impact higher terrain as the eye moves across the island, said Alan Gerard, a retired NOAA meteorologist, in an update on the afternoon of Oct. 28.\n\nWhen Gilbert made landfall on the island in 1988, it \"left areas of completely denuded landscape,\" said Gerard, who expected Melissa's damage to be similar or worse.\n\n\"It is not hyperbole to say that western Jamaica is currently experiencing tropical cyclone impacts near the top of what is possible on this planet,\" he said.\n\nCongresswoman and Jamaican ambassador say U.S> government to be key in island's recovery\n\nThe \"potential for devastation is unmatched and couldn’t be underestimated,\" Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-New York, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, said in a post on X on Oct. 28. The Brooklyn congresswoman pointed to anxiety and fear Caribbean American families are experiencing with the storm.\n\n“For many of us with roots in the Caribbean, hurricanes are a familiar threat,” she said.\n\nOn Oct. 27, Antony Anderson, the Jamaican ambassador to the United States, and Clarke discussed the importance of nongovernmental organizations responding in hurricane preparedness and recovery efforts, according to Jessica Myers, a spokesperson for Clarke. But the two officials agreed the largest player in the hours and weeks ahead will be the American government.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nPresident Trump, Miami Heat, others pledge support\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One en route to Gyeongju, South Korea, and said they were watching the situation closely and would be prepared to offer humanitarian assistance to Jamaica. \"We're prepared to move,\" the president said.\n\nHe expressed surprise at Melissa's high winds. \"I've never seen numbers like that. I saw it a little while ago. 195 mile an hour wind,\" he said. \"I guess it can get that high, but I've never seen it.\"\n\n\"And it's literally just, you know, knocking down everything in front of it,\" he said.\n\nHours before its Oct. 28 game against the Charlotte Hornets, the Miami Heat NBA team announced that, in partnership with the Micky and Madeleine Arison Family Foundation and Carnival Cruise Line, it would make a $1 million donation to assist with recovery efforts following Hurricane Melissa.\n\nIn Miami, where many residents trace their roots back to Jamaica and Cuba, officials posted support and concern on social media this week, including City Commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins. \"As a first-generation American with both parents and all siblings born in Jamaica, my heart aches for what’s to come,\" Cohen Higgins posted on X on Tuesday afternoon. \"I will help in any and every way I can.\"\n\nAn 'insane flight' into Melissa\n\nHurricane Melissa tied the 1935 Labor Day hurricane in the Florida Keys for the lowest pressure at landfall in the Atlantic, said Andy Hazelton, an associate scientist at the University of Miami's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies.\n\nHazelton posted this on X shortly after landing after a morning reconnaissance flight on a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Hazelton called it \"an absolutely insane flight,\" saying he couldn't believe the data coming from one of the pieces of equipment they dropped into the storm, when it reported winds of 219 knots just above the surface. That converts to a 252 mph gust.\n\nA U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter mission was forced to return to its operating location on the morning of Oct. 28, after experiencing \"forces stronger than normal due to turbulence,\" the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron announced in a post on X.\n\nSafety procedures require an inspection before returning to normal procedures. It was the second day in a row that turbulence inside the hurricane had forced a reconnaissance flight to end its mission early.\n\nHurricane Melissa makes most powerful landfall in Jamaica history\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph – maximum speeds measure winds at the surface, but gusts are higher and winds are stronger at higher elevations.\n\nMelissa breaks the old strongest Jamaican hurricane landfall record set by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 (130 mph winds).\n\nIt's the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall since Dorian (2019), according to Colorado State University's Klotzbach. Dorian also made landfall with 185 mph winds when it hit Abaco Island in the Bahamas.\n\nConditions to pick up 'very quickly' as Hurricane Melissa approaches Jamaica\n\nIn an 11:15 a.m. update, Michael Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said Hurricane Melissa was poised to make landfall within \"an hour or two.\"\n\n\"A very dangerous scenario is now starting to play out in the next few hours as the eye of Melissa moves across Jamaica,\" Brennan said.\n\nWind gusts over 200 mph are possible in some of the high mountains across Jamaica, Brennan said.\n\nBecause Melissa's eye is only 10 miles across, Brennan cautioned that winds and dangerous conditions will pick up \"very quickly\" as the backside of the eye moves through.\n\nHe urged people not to go outside during the brief clearing as the eye passes.\n\n\"We are starting to experience quite a few impacts of this system,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Meteorological Service, Jamaica, during an update on Oct. 28.\n\n“We have been experiencing rainfall over much of the island, especially in the west and south,\" Thompson said.\n\nHow to protect yourself from catastrophic Hurricane Melissa winds\n\nThe National Hurricane Center urged Jamaica's residents to act now to protect their lives before the eye of Melissa moves over the island.\n\n\"THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION! TAKE COVER NOW!\" the center said at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nTo protect yourself from wind, put as many walls as possible between you and the outside, moving to an interior room without windows and where you can avoid falling trees, the center said. You can also cover yourself with a mattress and wear a helmet.\n\nLife-threatening winds from Hurricane Melissa will be even worse in the mountains\n\nWithin the catastrophic winds of the eyewall, \"total structural failure is likely, especially in higher elevation areas where wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains could be up to 30% stronger\" than the winds at the surface, the hurricane center warned.\n\nIf the estimated sustained winds at the surface remain at 185 mph, that would put wind speeds at Jamaica's higher elevations well over 230 mph.\n\nHaunting video shows what's inside Hurricane Melissa\n\nBreathtaking video from the eye of fearsome Hurricane Melissa emerged from a Hurricane Hunter flight with the U.S. Air Force Reserve, clearly showing the inner workings that turned it into one of the most powerful storms in the history of the Atlantic hurricane basin.\n\nIn the videos taken on Monday, clusters of clouds swirl around the hurricane's \"eye.\" At times, the clouds show bright white, highlighted by the sun. The relatively calm \"eye\" gives a hurricane its structure and intensity. A storm's most intense winds reside in a ring just around that center known as the eyewall. Read more.\n\nHurricane Melissa to become first Category 5 hurricane to strike Jamaica\n\nJamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness and other officials urged Jamaicans to seek safe shelter and to stay off the roads until the worst of the hurricane passes over. The island's residents were also encouraged to be prepared for impacts they have not experienced with previous hurricanes.\n\n\"Hour by hour, it is becoming apparent that the impact of Hurricane Melissa will be greater than the impact of Hurricane Beryl, certainly in terms of rainfall and flooding,\" Holness said.\n\nMelissa was expected to be the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island. That's the highest category possible on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. It's also forecast to bring up to a 13-foot storm surge, topped by large battering waves, on the south coast of Jamaica, and a surge almost as high where it's forecast to strike the southeastern coast of Cuba, the hurricane center said.\n\nTracking Hurricane Melissa See Melissa's path as it's set to make landfall in Jamaica\n\nTorrential rains had already been falling for days, and tropical storm-force winds and rain in Melissa's outer bands had begun to batter Jamaica earlier Monday. The hurricane was forecast to make landfall near the Black River and begin increasing in speed.\n\nThe storm could cause \"extensive infrastructural damage, long-lasting power and communication outages,\" isolating communities, the center said.\n\nEven if the hurricane's fiercest winds begin to wane as the hurricane approaches land, the hurricane center warned there is little difference in the destructive power of winds that are Category 4 (130-156 mph) as opposed to Category 5, (greater than 157 mph).\n\nMelissa powered up over the warm waters in the Caribbean last week, its winds increasing by 65 mph in one 15-hour period. Its low barometric pressure and high winds moved Melissa into a rarified group of the most dangerous hurricanes in the Atlantic basin, researchers said.\n\nAfter Jamaica, Hurricane Melissa will take aim at Cuba and the Bahamas\n\nAfter battering Jamaica, a slightly weakened Hurricane Melissa is forecast to continue to move to the northeast and take aim at Cuba late Tuesday and on Wednesday.\n\nTropical storm conditions were expected to begin in eastern Cuba in the afternoon.\n\n\"We continue to see strong support for a landfall just to the west of Santiago de Cuba, the second largest city in the country,\" said Houston-based meteorologist Matt Lanza in his blog The Eyewall Tuesday morning. \"I would anticipate that a category 3 or 4 storm is likely to hit Cuba tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. This looks worse than Sandy and potentially the worst on record in eastern Cuba.\"\n\nOnce across Cuba, Melissa will weaken a little more, entering the southeast Bahamas likely as a Category 2 hurricane, he predicted. Hurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central Bahamas on Wednesday, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe center of the storm and worst winds will likely pass near Long Island and Crooked Island in the Bahamas, while impacts will be felt over a wider area, including portions of the Turks and Caicos Islands, according to Lanza.\n\nAfter tearing through the Bahamas, Melissa will accelerate into the Atlantic Ocean, potentially impacting Bermuda by Thursday and Friday.\n\nDeaths, injuries reported in the islands as Hurricane Melissa approaches\n\nAt least three people died in Jamaica as they were preparing for Hurricane Melissa, Christopher Tufton, the country’s minister of health and wellness, said on Monday.\n\nThe deaths, which occurred in the parishes of Hanover, Saint Catherine and Saint Elizabeth, happened while trees were being cut down, Tufton said. Two people died after trees fell on them, including one health worker who was airlifted to a hospital and later died of his injuries. The third case involved a person who was also electrocuted, the health minister said.\n\nAnother 13 people were injured, according to Tufton, most after falling from ladders or roofs while trying to prepare for the storm.\n\nAt least four deaths also had been reported in Haiti and the Dominican Republic by late Monday, according to Reuters.\n\nWhat's keeping Hurricane Melissa away from the United States?\n\nA series of weather systems has contributed to heavy rain and dangerous surf across parts of the Southeast, especially in Florida, but the well-timed systems are also part of a weather pattern that's forecast to help spare the mainland U.S. from any direct impacts from powerful Hurricane Melissa.\n\nOn Sunday, \"multiple feet\" of water were reported in the lobby of a Boca Raton resort after heavy rains, according to the National Weather Service in Miami, Florida. In Central Florida, more than 19 inches of rain were reported within 24 hours in Eustis, in Lake County, while more than 16 inches of rain were reported in multiple locations elsewhere in the county, according to the weather service office in Melbourne, Florida. Read more.\n\nHurricane Melissa's coastal impacts on the US\n\nMelissa could briefly bring a swell and rough seas to the U.S. East Coast after it passes the Bahamas later in the week, but because of the angle and speed at which it's moving off into the Atlantic, David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, said any coastal impacts should be short-lived.\n\nAlthough storms passing offshore, including tropical systems and a nor'easter, have caused erosion and beach impacts several times this hurricane season, the only Atlantic system to make landfall in the mainland U.S. so far was Tropical Storm Chantal, which moved over the South Carolina coast and through North Carolina on July 6.\n\nHurricane Melissa is a dangerous storm\n\nAs Melissa's pressure dropped and winds increased on Monday and Tuesday, it began working its way into the history books. It's the third Category 5 hurricane of the Atlantic season.\n\nBarometric pressure is a measure of the air pressure in Earth's atmosphere. Low pressure is often associated with bad weather, while high pressure is typically linked to good weather.\n\nThe lower the pressure, the more powerful the hurricane, Klotzbach, the senior hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, said in a post on X.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, its pressure plummeted to 892 millibars in a 10 a.m. update on Tuesday, putting it third on Klotzbach's list of hurricanes with the lowest recorded pressures:\n\nWilma (2005): 882\n\nGilbert (1988): 888\n\nMelissa (2025): 892\n\nMilton (2024): 895\n\nRita (2005): 895\n\nAllen (1980): 899\n\nKatrina (2005): 902\n\nOnly five other hurricanes with winds of 111 mph or higher have made landfall in Jamaica, according to historical records, said Phil Klotzbach, a senior hurricane research scientist at Colorado State University. Hurricane Gilbert, which made landfall with maximum winds of 130 mph in 1988, is the strongest storm on record to make a direct landfall on the island.\n\nTurbulence in the eye of the powerful hurricane forced one reconnaissance flight with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to depart the eye of the storm early on Monday, according to the hurricane center.\n\nHurricane Melissa promises feet of rain in Jamaica. How it measures up\n\nA forecast for several feet of rain is rare, but not unheard of during fall storms in Jamaica.\n\n2010 – Hurricane Nicole matched that, but in less time, dropping 37.42 inches of rain at Belleisle, Jamaica, over five days, the hurricane center reported. Most of the island received 1 to 2 feet of rain during the same period. More than 13 people died, and damage to the country's infrastructure was reported at roughly $235 million.\n\n2001 – During the last few days of October and the first few days of November in 2001, slow-moving Hurricane Michelle helped cause widespread heavy rains over Central America and Jamaica, according to the hurricane center. Rainfall totals over 10 days were as high as 37.44 inches at Comfort Castle, Jamaica. Two deaths were reported in Jamaica, and five deaths were reported in Cuba.\n\n1963 – Hurricane Flora reportedly dropped 60 inches of rain in Silver Hill, Jamaica, and 100.39 inches in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, according to a historical report by David Roth, a NOAA meteorologist.\n\n1909 – Historical records, including a monthly review by the U.S. Weather Bureau, show a record of 135 inches of rain at Silver Hill over eight days from Nov. 4 to Nov. 11.\n\nContributing: Swapna Venugopal, USA TODAY, and Reuters\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, has written about hurricanes, tornadoes and violent weather for more than 30 years.

The storm knocked out two of the Caribbean's biggest cruise stops, St. Thomas and St. Maarten — the Dutch side of the island of St. Martin. It also caused significant damage to several other cruise destinations including Key West, Fla.; St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands; Barbuda; St. Barts; and Tortola in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nIn many cases, the ships that are scheduled to visit Dominica starting next month also were scheduled to visit the islands hit hardest by Irma. An Oct. 30 sailing of Seabourn's 450-passenger Seabourn Odyssey out of Miami, for instance, is scheduled to visit the British Virgin Islands and St. Barts in addition to Dominica.

Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda Thursday and Thursday night.\n\n: Rainfall : Melissa is expected to bring an additional 6 to 12 inches across Jamaica, where storm total amounts will be between 12 to 24 inches. Isolated areas near 30 inches will be possible over mountainous terrain. Ongoing catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides will continue through Tuesday night. For eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches is expected through Wednesday, with local amounts to 25 inches expected over mountainous terrain. This will cause life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides. Over the Southeast Bahamas, storm total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected through Wednesday, which will result in areas of flash flooding. For the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected. Heavy rain may begin to affect Bermuda Thursday night. Over southern Hispaniola, additional rainfall of 2 to 6 inches is expected through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima of 40 inches possible.\n\n: Storm surge: On the northwest coast of Jamaica, near Montego Bay, there is the possibility of 2 to 4 feet of storm surge above ground level. Storm surge flooding on the southern coast of Jamaica should subside tonight. There is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast coast of Cuba late today or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights could reach 8 to 12 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the east of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Minor coastal flooding is possible in bays and inlets along the north coast of eastern Cuba. Storm surge of 5 to 8 ft above normally dry ground is possible in the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday, and 2 to 4 ft above normally dry ground in the Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday. Minor coastal flooding is expected along the coast of Haiti.\n\nSurf: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of Hispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the next day or two, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Bermuda later this week. Please consult products from your local weather office.\n\nHurricane Melissa: What you need to know\n\nAt 5 p.m., the center of Hurricane Melissa was located near latitude 18.5 North, longitude 77.7 West.\n\nMelissa is moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph. A turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected this evening, followed by a faster northeastward motion on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nOn the forecast track, the core of Melissa will move away from western Jamaica this evening. After that, the center is expected to move over southeastern Cuba later tonight and early Wednesday morning, move across the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday, and approach Bermuda Thursday and Thursday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 145 mph with higher gusts. Melissa is a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nMelissa is expected to reach southeastern Cuba as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, and it could still be a major hurricane when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas.\n\nNOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft will be investigating Melissa this evening.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 921 mb.\n\nHurricane Melissa spaghetti models, trajectory, projected path\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal.

A hurricane warning is in effect for Bermuda, as Melissa is forecast to pass to the northwest of the island later Thursday into Thursday evening. Forecasters said some slight strengthening is possible before weakening begins on Friday, Oct. 31.\n\nOver the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, an additional inch of rain is possible, bringing storm total maximums up to 10 inches in the Bahamas. Across Bermuda, outer bands of Melissa's track may bring up to an inch of rain throughout the day Thursday.\n\nAdditionally, swells generated by Melissa will continue to affect portions of Hispaniola, Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the next couple of days, and will spread toward Bermuda later Thursday, causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, the NHC said in the advisory.\n\nHurricane Melissa live updates: At least 30 dead as storm heads to Bermuda\n\nHurricane Melissa spaghetti models\n\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal.

On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States sent rescue and response teams to areas impacted by the hurricane.\n\nHow do hurricanes form?\n\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\n\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen & Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

In addition, \"the intensity forecast is also more uncertain than usual, in large part related to the track uncertainty.\"\n\nAnd with the chances of a monstrous Category 5 storm still in play, the potential is there for Melissa to be \"the most impactful storm of the 2025 season,\" said Houston-based meteorologist Matt Lanza in a Substack post on Oct. 22.\n\nIndeed, if Melissa does end up turning west over the Caribbean south of Jamaica (like some model forecasts show), \"I don't think it's hyperbolic to say we will likely get a Category 5, and quite possibly one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic,\" Andrew Hazelton, an associate scientist at the University of Miami's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, said on X Oct. 22.\n\nJamaica in the crosshairs\n\nForecasters from the hurricane center on Thursday, Oct. 23 said that in the short term, Jamaica will likely see the worst of the storm's fury: \"Due to Melissa’s slow motion, the risk of a prolonged multi-day period of potentially damaging winds, heavy rainfall resulting in life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides, and coastal flooding continues to increase for Jamaica.\"\n\n\"Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, since strong winds and flooding rains could begin in Jamaica by Friday (Oct. 24) or Saturday (Oct. 25),\" the hurricane center warned.\n\nHazelton added on X that he's \"becoming increasingly concerned for the possibility of a close pass or direct hit on Jamaica from Melissa. Overnight hurricane models have trended closer and all show impacts on the island.\"\n\nWorst-case scenario for the Caribbean\n\n\"The worst case is that (Melissa) sits close enough to one or several of the mountainous Caribbean islands and dumps feet of rain,\" Fox Weather hurricane expert Bryan Norcross told the USA TODAY Network via email. \"Three or four feet are not out of the question.\"\n\nThe heavy rain could trigger life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in some areas, the hurricane center said. Areas like Hispaniola are especially prone to catastrophic flash floods due to the island’s complex and mountainous terrain, noted WPLG-TV meteorologist Michael Lowry in a Substack post. \"Flooding is historically the deadliest calling card of tropical systems in this part of the world, and the threat Melissa brings will be no exception.\"\n\nLanza said, \"this could be catastrophic in some places, including portions of Jamaica and Haiti or the southern Dominican Republic as well. Just really bad news with a slow-moving Melissa.\"\n\nIn addition, next week there is some possibility of it becoming a very strong hurricane before it makes its move to the north, Norcross said. \"In that case, direct impacts of a major hurricane are possible on Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, and/or somewhere in the Bahamas.\"\n\nWorst-case scenario for the US\n\nNone of the reliable computer models show Melissa having any direct impact on the United States mainland.\n\nBut forecasters say there is still a small chance of a U.S. impact: \"Chances of some direct effect on Florida aren't zero, but they are extremely small,\" said Norcross via email Oct. 21.\n\n\"The only way it could happen would be for Melissa to drift into the extreme western Caribbean before a dip in the jet stream moving across the U.S. came along to scoop it north,\" Norcross said. \"There is no indication of that in the current reasonable track scenarios, however. Still, a track over Cuba and the Bahamas is not out of the question.\"\n\nAccuWeather's DaSilva clarified further: \"Even if Melissa reaches the western Caribbean, that doesn’t guarantee direct impacts in Florida; many models still show it moving over central Cuba and then out to sea. For now, there’s nothing immediate to worry about, but it’s definitely worth monitoring closely over the coming days.\"\n\nMap shows Melissa forecast track\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nCould Melissa become a Category 5 storm?\n\nMelissa is going to move slowly over the next five to seven days over some of the warmest, deepest warm water in the Atlantic Basin, Lanza said.\n\nHurricanes power up when they move over warm, deep ocean water of at least 80 degrees.\n\n\"Intensification into a hurricane and major hurricane seems likely at this point, with a high-end category 4 or 5 in the realm of the possible,\" Lanza said.\n\nThe hurricane center's official forecast shows Melissa reaching Category 4 strength, with winds of 130 mph, by the weekend.\n\n\"It is becoming increasingly likely that Melissa will become a large and dangerous hurricane,\" the hurricane center said on the afternoon of Oct. 22.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information and to add a video.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2017/09/29/caribbean-cruises-what-you-need-know-wake-irma-maria/712755001/", "title": "Caribbean cruises: What you need to know after Irma, Maria", "text": "Updated Sept. 29, 2017, 9:35 a.m. ET\n\nBooked on a cruise to the Caribbean in the next few months? The devastation wrought by hurricanes Irma and Maria in the region probably has you worried. The storms and their aftereffects already have forced cruise lines to cancel or adjust dozens of sailings, and more changes are in the works.\n\nStill, the situation may not be as bad as you think. Most destinations in the Caribbean were unaffected by the storms, and a large percentage of cruises this fall will go ahead exactly as they were planned. Others only will see small adjustments.\n\nHere, answers to some of the most common questions that cruisers have been asking.\n\nIs my Caribbean cruise out of Florida still on?\n\nIn most cases, yes. Cruise lines canceled more than a dozen Caribbean and Bahamas voyages out of Florida as Irma approached, but nearly all sailings out of the state now are departing on schedule. The exception: Trips to the Bahamas on Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line’s Grand Celebration. The West Palm Beach, Fla.-based, 1,900-passenger ship has been chartered to FEMA through late December to serve as a floating hotel for relief workers, and all of its sailings through Dec. 23 have been canceled.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nWhat if I’m cruising from San Juan?\n\nThe outlook for cruises out of San Juan is in flux. It’s increasingly clear that Puerto Rico suffered widespread devastation from Maria, and a massive recovery effort is just ramping up. The two lines with ships based in San Juan at this time of year, Carnival and Royal Caribbean, already have canceled departures for the coming weekend, and Carnival also has canceled its Oct. 8 sailing from the city. Carnival said its pier in San Juan suffered extensive damage that will take weeks to repair. As of now, Carnival’s Oct. 15 sailing out of San Juan still is listed as on its schedule, and Royal Caribbean has yet to cancel its Oct. 7 sailing out of the city. But changes to these trips could be coming. A travel alert posted on Carnival's website Thursday said revisions to the line's Oct. 15, 22 and 29 voyages out of San Juan are in the works. Royal Caribbean, meanwhile, is using its San Juan-based ship, Adventure of the Seas, to evacuate thousands of people from Puerto Rico and St. Thomas to the U.S. mainland.\n\nEven if the ships are sailing, aren’t a lot of the ports they visit closed?\n\nNot at all. Most were unaffected by Irma and Maria. The storms knocked two of the region's busiest cruise ports — Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas and Philipsburg, St. Maarten — off cruise schedules for weeks and maybe months. Several other less-visited cruise destinations including Tortola in the British Virgin Islands also are closed to ships for now. But as big as they were, Irma and Maria only affected a small slice of the vast Caribbean Sea. While they left a trail of destruction across a string of Eastern Caribbean islands, the storms didn't touch the Western Caribbean — home to more than a dozen cruise ports including Cozumel, Mexico and Harvest Caye, Belize. Nor did they affect Southern Caribbean cruise destinations such as Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. Also relatively unaffected were the big ports of The Bahamas, which are among the biggest destinations for cruise ships sailing from Florida.\n\nMore: Is your Caribbean cruise destination open? A port-by-port look | St. Thomas could open to ships by late October | Cruise lines extend relief efforts\n\nWhen will the affected islands reopen to cruise ships?\n\nThe short answer: Sooner than you think. Officials on hurricane-ravaged islands such as St. Thomas have made the return of cruise ships a priority as spending by cruisers will provide an economic boost that is critical to recovery efforts. The governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands has set late October as a target to have ships back in St. Thomas and St. Croix, even as many hotels in the territory are expected to remain closed for at least six months, and basic infrastructure such as power remains down in many locations. Other hard-hit destinations such as St. Maarten — the Dutch side of the island of St. Martin — are pushing to reopen to ships before the end of the year.\n\nI’m on a ship scheduled to visit St. Thomas in the coming weeks. If St. Thomas still is closed to cruise vessels, where will it go?\n\nCruise ships scheduled to visit hard-hit islands in the coming weeks are being redirected to other destinations as substitutes. Some vessels scheduled to visit St. Thomas and St. Maarten instead are going to nearby St. Kitts and Antigua. Others are sailing to ports in the Western Caribbean.\n\nBut I really wanted to see St. Thomas. If my ship isn’t going there, can I cancel the trip?\n\nYou can cancel, but you might not get all of your money back. The fine print in cruise line contracts allows them to change ports for any reason. If your trip is months away, you generally can cancel for a full refund (in some cases, you’ll lose a non-refundable deposit). But if you cancel a soon-to-depart sailing, you’ll only get a portion of your money back. The “final payment” deadline that triggers cancellation penalties varies by line. At Carnival, it’s 75 days before departure for seven-night sailings. If you cancel a seven-night Carnival cruise from 75 to 56 days in advance of departure, the penalty is the deposit amount. After that, the penalty jumps to 50% of the total fare, and it continues to rise as the sailing date approaches.\n\nIf my ship does go to one of these hard-hit islands will anything be open?\n\nIn the wake of hurricanes in the Caribbean, port area shops and restaurants often are among the first businesses to reopen, long before residential areas return to normal. Officials in St. Thomas say merchants along Main Street in Charlotte Amalie, where cruise ships arrive, already are ready for tourists to return. St. Thomas also is racing to get top attractions such as the Magens Bay beach area cleaned up and ready for visitors in the next few weeks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/29"}]}

She planned to send the image her mother, who could not attend.\n\nFor Megan Hartman, the Sept. 10 killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event on the campus of Utah Valley University, was deeply personal. She has been in mourning.\n\n\"I wish we could be here under more pleasant circumstances. I hate we have to meet like this. I'm so happy that you are all here to honor Charlie and his memory,\" she told the crowd, which she later estimated at \"a couple thousand.\"\n\nHartman heard Kirk speak on the Springfield campus in October 2023.\n\n\"It just changed my life and I got the opportunity to meet him afterward and he was just the kindest person you could ever meet, even if people hated people, even if they screamed at him, he was always just awesome,\" she said.\n\n\"He liked to preach kindness and the truth and respect and it cost him his life.\"\n\nKirk, 31, in 2012 co-founded Turning Point USA, an organization that pushes for conservative politics on high school and college campuses.\n\nKirk was a polarizing figure, beloved by many conservatives but criticized by others who have highlighted his comments on race, religion, politics, gender and other topics and described them as divisive and hateful.\n\nThe killing of Kirk has been widely condemned by leaders from across the political spectrum in Missouri and the U.S. They have also condemned the increased political violence.\n\nSecurity was highly visible at the Sept. 22 candlelight vigil organized by the chapter at Missouri State with support from the chapters at Glendale High School and Drury University.\n\nThere were families, including mothers pushing babies in strollers, students carrying \"Jesus is King\" and \"Build Back Biblical\" signs and women wearing red \"Make American Godly Again\" hats.\n\nPolice and campus safety officers were posted on the edges of the crowd and on rooftops. Barricades limited the flow of traffic near the vigil.\n\nA handful of protestors carried signs and waived the Palestinian flag but their arrival prompted the crowd to chant \"USA.\" Kirk supporters moved into place, carrying their own signs and the American flag.\n\nMixed with the students, there were community members, church groups and elected officials. U.S. Rep. Eric Burlison was present along with Springfield school board member Maryam Mohammadkhani.\n\nAs the skies darkened, members of the crowd lit their candles and then shared the flames with their neighbors.\n\n\"Tonight we stand together under the soft glow of candles to honor the memory of Charlie Kirk, a man whose voice, passion, unyielding spirit has touched so many of our lives,\" said John Osborne, vice president of the Turning Point group at Missouri State.\n\n\"The past 12 days, our heart has been heavy, weighed down by palpable grief, creating a kind of tired that sleep can't fix.

He was killed at Utah Valley University in Orem during one of his popular campus events, where he encouraged free debate with anyone who wanted to question him.\n\nI mourn another instance of awful political violence, stressing the fabric of our country. A man was killed for fighting for what he thought was right, and he leaves behind a wife and two young children. That should sadden us all.\n\nAmerica is better off as a place where people can exchange ideas freely, without fear of being killed or otherwise persecuted. Charlie understood this ideal and fought for it. If his death leads to anything, it should reinforce that feeling in us all.\n\nYoung conservatives will miss Charlie Kirk\n\nCharlie is one of the most influential figures in right-wing politics for my generation. At just 31 years old, he built Turning Point USA, a massive conservative activist network. Through that effort, he has registered thousands of young voters and was a key influence on the shape of campus conservatism.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nDespite our differences of policy and approach on many issues, I always respected Charlie for his commitment to honest debate. There are a few people who have the bravery to go in front of massive crowds on hostile turf and debate political ideas.He gave young conservatives like me a role model of someone who was not afraid of speaking his mind despite whatever accusations or threats were thrown his way. He was routinely met with threats of violence and continued to do what he did, knowing that there was always a chance someone would act against him.\n\nYoung conservatives will feel this loss for years to come\n\nWithout Charlie, there is a massive void left among young conservatives. Charlie was one of the voices who sparked my interest in politics when I was a young conservative on campus, and I know I am far from the only one. He always encouraged young conservatives to be unapologetically true to themselves, and we still must be.\n\nWe cannot allow this killing to discourage others from advocating for our beliefs. Being a conservative on campus is already extremely hard as it is, and the looming threat of violence only adds to that stigma. I hope that young conservatives become more emboldened from this, not more reluctant.\n\nAmericans should be sad today, for Charlie and his family, but also for what this means for the future. I don’t want to live in a place where this violence is a common occurrence. Young conservatives have to show that violence is not an effective way to silence us. Young conservatives on campus have the unfortunate responsibility now to become louder, not quieter, in response. We need more young leaders like Charlie, not fewer.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/09/16/turning-point-usa-group-at-glendale-high-to-charlie-kirk-vigil-at-msu/86192179007/", "title": "Turning Point USA group at Glendale to join Charlie Kirk vigil at MSU", "text": "Sept. 16, 2025 Updated Sept. 17, 2025, 1:41 a.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary A candlelight vigil for conservative activist Charlie Kirk will be held on the Missouri State University campus.\n\nThe vigil is a combined effort by the Turning Point USA chapters of Glendale High School and Missouri State.\n\nThe killing of Kirk has been widely condemned by political leaders across the U.S.\n\nA Springfield high school chapter of Turning Point USA announced it will participate in a Sept. 22 candlelight vigil for conservative activist Charlie Kirk on the Missouri State University campus.\n\nKirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed Sept. 10 while addressing an outdoor crowd on the campus of Utah Valley University.\n\nGlendale High School's Turning Point USA chapter initially planned to host its own vigil this week on the high school parking lot.\n\nThe event was postponed \"due to overwhelming community support.\"\n\nRather than reschedule, the Glendale chapter will join the vigil organized by the Turning Point USA chapter at Missouri State.\n\nThe event is 7 p.m. Monday, Sept. 22 in front of the Plaster Student Union.

As diverse as our opinions may be, we can agree to disagree and we can thank each other.\"\n\nBaljit Singh Sandhu, a Stockton resident, said he attended the vigil with his children, who follow Kirk's work.

That's what it means to say, 'I am Charlie,'\" Sandhu said, referring to a phrase seen on shirts and posters. \"You be a good father, be a good husband, be a good citizen ... if you do that, Charlie never dies.\"\n\nThroughout the vigil, several local religious leaders led the audience in shared prayers and music. They included Deacon Michael Wofford of Cathedral of the Annunciation, Rabbi Jason Gwasdoff of Temple Israel, Bishop Dwight Earl Williams of New Genesis Outreach Ministries and Pastor Brad Stahl of First Baptist Church of Stockton.\n\n\"What happened in the past few days, past few weeks, is totally unacceptable and must be condemned,\" Williams said. \"Violence of any kind is wrong, especially when you're talking about a matter of opinion. I have every right to my opinion, and here's the beauty of it: So do you. Everybody should be respected.\"\n\nWofford said he believed all moral and civil ideologies are built on the knowledge and acceptance that all people have unconditional dignity.\n\n\"Dignity must be afforded to all people,\" Wofford said. \"Regardless of their characteristics, their citizenship, their personal or social status, Democrats or Republicans, housed or unhoused, incarcerated or paroled, clean or addicted, those with physical, mental or emotional challenges ... we are all created in the image and likeness of God.\"\n\nThe religious leaders' remarks were interrupted by a woman on a bicycle who approached Gwasdoff as he held the microphone. The woman shouted, \"Are we allowed to remember this dude for everything he said?\"\n\nSeveral audience members shouted back, \"Get out of here!\" and followed the woman, pushing her to another area of the park. She continued to circle the vigil for several minutes, yelling, \"America is greater than racism!\" and \"The Civil Rights Act was not a mistake!\"\n\nAccording to a 2024 Wired story, during America Fest, Turning Point's annual conference in December 2023, Kirk said, \"We made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s.\" The landmark law signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.\n\nAs the woman protested against Kirk's remarks, vigil attendees began to chant \"USA!\" while others sang \"God Bless America.\"\n\nStockton police officers, who observed the vigil from across the street, handcuffed the woman following a brief confrontation with a vigil attendee.\n\nOfficer Omer Edhah, a spokesperson for the Stockton Police Department, said the woman was arrested for misdemeanor simple battery.

Some 30% blamed Democrats and 23% were \"not sure.\"\n\nSenate Democrats won't approve a Republican government spending plan, demanding the GOP restore Trump cuts that will push 10.9 million people from Medicaid and Obamacare.\n\nConstruction of a new $200 million White House ballroom, funded by private donors, continued amid the shutdown.\n\nOut-of-office emails at the Education Department blamed Democrats for the shutdown, mirroring partisan messages from other government agencies.\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ The federal government shutdown reached day two on Thursday as President Donald Trump said he would decide which \"Democrat Agencies\" to close and congressional Republicans and Democrats showed no signs of ending their impasse over funding the government.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt later said Trump would use the shutdown to cut “agencies and programs that do not align with the Administration’s policies and values.”\n\nTrump has already frozen federal transit and green energy funding for Democratic-leaning states and has threatened mass firings of federal workers. \"I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,\" he said on social media.\n\nWhat federal jobs are at risk? Here's who is furloughed.\n\nHanging over the stalemate is Trump’s threat to cull federal workers. White House officials warned mass firings are “imminent” under a shutdown. Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Republican lawmakers in a private call on Oct. 1 that mass reductions in force will begin in “a day or two.”\n\nThe main sticking point remains Democratic demands to restore funding to Medicaid and Obamacare after cuts Trump signed into law this year that the Congressional Budget Office says will leave 10.9 million people without health insurance. Republicans want to keep the government operating at existing funding levels, but they lack a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate despite their majority.\n\nTrump doubles down on threat to fire workers, cut programs\n\nPresident Donald Trump doubled down on his threats to cut federal programs and fire workers across the federal government if the shutdown continues.\n\n“There could be firings – and that’s their fault,” Trump, referring to Democrats, said in an interview with the conservative television network OAN. “And it could also be other things. We could cut projects that they wanted, favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”\n\nThe interview, which was conducted Wednesday, aired Thursday evening. Earlier on Thursday, Trump said he planned to meet with Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, to decide which “Democrat agencies” of the federal government to close.\n\n“A lot of people are saying, ‘Trump wanted this.’ That I wanted this closing,” Trump said in the television interview. “And I didn’t want it. But a lot of people are saying it because I’m allowed to cut things that should have never been approved in the first place. And I will probably do that.”\n\n--Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House ballroom work continues amid shutdown\n\nGovernment shutdown or not, construction on President Trump’s pet project, a 90,000-square-foot ballroom replacing a large part of the East Wing, is continuing apace.\n\nThe $200 million dollar project, unveiled in July, will feature gilded interiors and seat 900 people.\n\nA White House official told USA TODAY that because the project is being sponsored by Trump and private donors, it is not impacted by the shutdown.\n\nConstruction began in September and is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s term in 2028.\n\n--Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nGovernment out-of-office emails blame Dems for shutdown\n\nOfficial email accounts at the U.S. Department of Education began sending out-of-office messages are pointing fingers at Democrats for the funding crisis.\n\n\"Thank you for contacting me,\" said one message. \"On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations.\"\n\nThe automatic response is the latest example of the Trump administration using the formal levers of government in new, controversial ways to pressure Democrats to end the shutdown. Other federal agencies have crafted similarly partisan messages from the typically apolitical civil service amid a legislative standoff largely over disagreements related to health care cuts.\n\n--Zachary Schermele\n\nSenate will vote to end shutdown but outcome is uncertain\n\nThe Senate will vote again Oct. 3 on whether to end the shutdown and reopen the government.\n\nA series of votes is scheduled at 1:30 p.m., including one on the measure to extend funding temporarily until Nov. 21.\n\nBut two previous votes of 55-45 on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1 failed to advance the legislation, which needs a 60-vote majority.\n\nThree senators who caucus with Democrats – John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine – joined Republicans in supporting the bill. But GOP needs five more Democrats.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWhither the Smithsonian Panda Cam?\n\nThe Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, D.C., is still running its Giant Panda Cam, a live broadcast featuring pandas Bao Li and Qing Bao, on its website despite the government being shut down.\n\nThe camera shows images of the pandas' living quarters as well as occasional appearances of the animals themselves. The camera is live from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. eastern time daily, according to the Smithsonian’s website.\n\nThe Smithsonian, a federal government entity, says on its website that it will use money from the last fiscal year’s budget to stay open at least through Monday, Oct. 6.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi and Erin Mansfield\n\nHUD Secretary not 'at all' worried partisan messages break the law\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development’s aggressive messaging about the shutdown on its website, blasting the “radical left,” has drawn complaints from Democrats about its legality.\n\nBut HUD Secretary Scott Turner told NewsNation he’s not “at all” worried.\n\nThe 1939 Hatch Act limits the political activities of federal employees. Democrats have pointed to the law to criticize the Trump administration for using official government channels to blast a highly partisan message.\n\n\"I’ve heard all the cries and the outcry and people saying this is propaganda, that it’s a violation of the Hatch Act,\" Turner said, calling the criticism an effort by \"Democrats and the far left\" to distract from their \"irresponsible actions.\"\n\nThe HUD website currently states: “The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.”\n\n--Zac Anderson\n\nMore Americans blame Trump and GOP for shutdown, poll says\n\nClose to half of Americans blame President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans for the government partially shutting down, according to a new poll.\n\nIn a survey conducted by the Washington Post on Oct. 1 – the first day of the shutdown – 47% said they blamed Trump and Republicans in Congress for the ongoing impasse that has left thousands of federal workers without pay and halted various government activities.\n\nAnother 30% blame the crisis on congressional Democrats, and 23% said they were \"not sure\" when asked who they think is \"mainly responsible\" for the shutdown.\n\n--Kathryn Palmer\n\nHow does the government shutdown impact WIC?\n\nIf the shutdown continues, the WIC nutritional program will likely run out of funding within one or two weeks, National WIC Association President and CEO Georgia Machell said in a Sept. 30 news release.\n\nUntil then, WIC will continue operating under available funding, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) contingency plan.\n\nWIC is a federal nutrition program that provides food, education and counseling to nearly 7 million at-risk pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding mothers, as well as infants and children up to 5 years old.\n\nWIC can \"recover and reallocate unused grant funds from the previous fiscal year\" for state-level activity, but federal activities will cease once funding is unavailable, the plan says.\n\n--Greta Cross\n\nWhat's behind White House claims of 'illegal' immigrants on Medicaid?\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified the Trump administration’s opposition to immigrants participating in Medicaid after entering the country temporarily.\n\nLeavitt said the Biden administration allowed in millions of immigrants under humanitarian “parole” or under temporary programs for economic or environmental crises in their home countries.\n\nHow the government shuts down and what it means for you\n\nAdministration officials have referred to these immigrants as “illegal,” but they were admitted under formal government programs.\n\n“It was a complete abuse of our immigration system,” Leavitt told reporters Oct. 2 at the White House. “They slapped a Band-Aid. They called it Temporary Protected Status.”\n\nThe Biden administration admitted about 3 million immigrants under parole and 1.4 million from 16 countries were granted acceptance into Temporary Protected Status, according to House testimony and the Judiciary Committee.\n\nWhat is Trump's approval rating? Here's what polls said before the government shutdown\n\n“You know who would like free benefits? Hard-working Americans who work their butts off every day,” Leavitt said. “That is fundamentally unfair and this administration is not going to support it.\"\n\nBut immigrants admitted under parole of less than a year, those seeking asylum and those under Temporary Protected Status are generally barred from Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nWhile undocumented immigrants are barred from receiving federal health benefits, eligible immigrants who are in the country legally make up 6% of the total enrollment in Medicaid and the CHIP child health care program, according to the health policy nonprofit KFF.\n\nSenate Democrats are refusing to fund the government until majority Republicans restore cuts to Medicaid and Obamacare that the Congressional Budget Office says will end health insurance from 10.9 million people.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump has power to fire workers, shutter agencies: Speaker Johnson\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said President Trump was given “the keys to the kingdom” to lay off federal workers and close agencies during the shutdown.\n\n“This is the way the system works,” Johnson, R-Louisiana, told reporters Oct. 2. “When Congress turns off the funding, and the funding runs out, it’s up to the commander in chief, the president of the United States, will determine how those resources will be spent.”\n\nJohnson was asked if it was appropriate for Trump to target political opponents with spending cuts, after the administration halted $18 billion in funding for two New York City transit projects, a Second Avenue subway and Hudson River tunnel. New York is home of both congressional Democratic leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.\n\n“When they are tasked with determining what the priorities are, obviously they are going to follow their principles and priorities and not the other team,” Johnson said of Trump and the administration. “That’s the results of an election that everyone voted in.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nShutdown unlikely to end today\n\nThe Senate does not have votes scheduled Thursday in observance of Yom Kippur.\n\nIt is scheduled to return Friday, when Senate Majority Leader John Thune of North Dakota is expected to make his next attempt at passing the GOP spending bill.\n\nThough the House is also expected to return Friday, the chamber has already passed the GOP bill and all action is expected to be on the Senate side of the Capitol building.\n\n--Sarah D. Wire\n\nSpeaker Johnson urges colleagues to ignore sombreros\n\nGOP House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he urged his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, to ignore social-media memes he called “games” and “sideshows” to help reopen the government.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had posted a clip of Jeffries at the White House wearing a fake sombrero and mustache, which Jeffries called racist. The White House ran the clip on a loop in the briefing room for hours on Oct. 1.\n\nJohnson said all lawmakers become the butt of internet jokes. Johnson noted that California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted a meme of the speaker as a cartoon Minion.\n\n“To my friend Hakeem: ‘Man, just ignore it,’” Johnson added. “Gavin Newsom was trolling me last night. He painted me like a Minion. He painted me yellow with big glasses and overalls. I thought it was hilarious. You don’t respond to it.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nProlonged shutdown could have a big impact on child care\n\nFederal dollars and programs support child care facilities across the country, including Head Start and Child Care and Development Block Grants. Head Start programs with grant cycles that begin in October will likely experience disruptions in the short term, according to First Focus on Children, a bipartisan advocacy nonprofit focused on supports for women and children. A prolonged shutdown could mean shuttered classrooms.\n\nMost federal Head Start programs are not likely to be impacted, said Sydney Petersen of the National Women’s Law Center. “But that could change if the shutdown drags on.” There are few Head Start programs – impacting roughly 6,500 children and families – that have funding cycles that began Oct. 1.\n\nFirst Five Years Fund, another organization building federal support for early childhood learning programs, posted about the shutdown on Oct. 1 saying there is “cause for watchful concern but not for panic.” There’s unlikely to be disrupted child care services in the short term, the analysis reads, but “the longer a shutdown continues, the more likely it is that Head Start programs could see a disruption.”\n\nWorking caregivers are especially vulnerable to the effects of a government shutdown, according to research from the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\n-- Madeline Mitchell\n\nWhat’s open during a government shutdown?\n\nThere are some services that still remain open despite the government being shut down.\n\nThese include the U.S. postal service, banks, air-traffic control and courts. Federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, DEA and prison staff, will remain operational. The Secret Service and Coast Guard will continue their duties.\n\nAll active-duty personnel stay on the job, but nearly half of the Department of War's 741,477 civilian employees could face furloughs.\n\nIn general, national parks will remain open “park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,\" according to the Department of Interior's contingency plan.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi, Natalie Neysa Alund and Saman Shafiq\n\nSome lawmakers request their pay be withheld while shutdown continues\n\nLawmakers will continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown under Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution, which protects Congress' pay.\n\nBut some members have said that they’ve requested that their pay be withheld until the shutdown is over. Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan wrote on X that she did not take a salary during the last government shutdown and won’t take one now.\n\nTexas Republican Rep. Chip Roy and Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Chris Deluzio posted images of letters they each wrote addressed to Catherine Szpindor, the chief administrative officer of the House, asking for their pay to be withheld.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted Democratic lawmakers who continue to accept their salary while the shutdown will delay paychecks for 1.3 million active-duty military troops, 150,000 federal law enforcement officers and 13,000 air-traffic controllers until the spending dispute is resolved.\n\n“I saw some Democrat members today saying they are still going to accept their paychecks because they have three kids at home and they have mouths to feed,” Leavitt told reporters Oct. 1. “Well, so do these federal workers who those same Democrats just voted to shut down the government and turn off their pay. We think that’s very unfair.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi and Bart Jansen\n\nTrump looks to cut 'Democrat agencies'\n\nPresident Donald Trump he would meet with Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought to determine which “Democrat Agencies” to eliminate to save money during the shutdown.\n\nTrump has warned of “irreversible” cuts during the shutdown and “vast” layoffs will be easier to accomplish during the shutdown because there is no congressional spending legislation in place to fund the government. Vought helped draft a Project 2025 report with recommendations and widespread agency cuts.\n\n“I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,” Trump said in a social media post Oct. 2.--Bart Jansen\n\nDOJ asks to delay court cases in shutdown\n\nThe Justice Department has begun asking federal courts to delay pending litigation during the shutdown by arguing that lawyers and other staffers are mostly forbidden from working even on a voluntary basis.\n\nBut lawyers opposing the government in at least two of the cases opposed the requests. One case involves Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant fighting deportation to Eswatini. The other case involves DC trying to block President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in the federal city.\n\nUntil Congress reaches a funding compromise to reopen the government, Justice lawyers and employees of federal defendants “are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis” except in “emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,” according to a filing led by Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate.\n\nBut he noted Garcia opposes the request.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland set a hearing Oct. 24 to hear arguments about either blocking the deportation or dismissing the case – unless she grants the government’s request for a delay.\n\nIn the DC case, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb set a series of filing deadlines this month Shumate asked to postpone. But DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb said the department’s shutdown guidance allows working on motions to block government actions despite a lapse in appropriations.\n\n“This case is a poor candidate in which to make an exception from that approach,” Schwalb wrote in a filing. “More than 2,300 armed National Guard troops are currently patrolling the District unlawfully. That unprecedented deployment is inflicting irreparable harm to the District’s sovereignty, its economy, and public safety.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump takes back seat on first day of shutdown\n\nTrump made no public appearances on the first day of the shutdown, with the White House instead deploying Vice President JD Vance to address the media. Vance blamed the “Chuck Schumer-AOC wing” of the Democratic Party for what he called a “Democrat shutdown.”\n\nVance called for Democrats to vote to reopen the government before and then engage later in separate negotiations over health-care policy. But Democrats in Congress continued to demand the reversal of Medicaid cuts that Republicans passed this year and the extension of health care subsidies be included in a funding measure.\n\n“Donald Trump and Republicans shut the federal government down because they don’t want to provide health care to working-class Americans,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.\n\nTrump and Republicans have countered by accusing Democrats of wanting to provide health care for immigrants who are in the country illegally. Democrats have called the claims a lie, noting that undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible for payments from Medicare, Medicaid, or the Affordable Care Act.\n\n‒ Joey Garrison\n\nWhat government services are impacted by a shutdown? Is Social Security at risk?\n\nSocial Security checks will still be delivered during the shutdown. Medicare and Medicaid benefits also will still be paid, but many other aspects of the federal government have halted during the shutdown.\n\nAll federal agencies and services that officials do not deem \"essential\" must stop working during a shutdown.\n\nAbout 750,000 \"nonessential\" federal employees ranging from workers at national parks to financial regulators could be furloughed each day under a shutdown, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, withholding about $400 million in daily compensation.\n\nFederal workers in essential services such as the Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security services, air-traffic control and the military will continue to work but won't be paid until the government reopens.\n\nWhite House keeps trolling Jeffries with sombrero video\n\nTrump has no plans to meet with Democratic congressional leaders again following their meeting earlier in the week. And in a sign of the divide, the White House keeps trolling Jeffries with videos portraying the Democratic leader in a fake mustache and sombrero.\n\nTrump posted the AI-generated videos on his social media accounts ahead of the shutdown. By Wednesday afternoon, the White House was playing the controversial ads on loop on televisions in the press briefing room.\n\nVance brushed off criticism from Jeffries and other Democrats who have called the videos racist. The videos also include made up audio of Schumer making derogatory comments about immigrants, as mariachi music played in the background.\n\n“The president's joking,” Vance said Wednesay when asked about the videos. “And we're having a good time.”\n\nThe vice president added: “Hakeem Jeffries said it was racist, and I know that he said that, and I honestly don’t even know what that means. Like, is he a Mexican-American that is offended by having a sombrero meme?”\n\n‒ Joey Garrison\n\nMass layoffs of federal workers to begin imminently, White House says\n\nVought, the White House's budget chief, told House Republicans in a private call Wednesday that mass layoffs of federal workers will begin in \"a day or two,\" according to a lawmaker on the call.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, during a briefing with reporters, did not elaborate on which federal departments could be affected, or how many workers could be fired. But she said layoffs are \"imminent.\"\n\nHistorically, nonessential federal workers are placed on furloughs during government shutdowns, but they are not part of widespread federal workforce layoffs. Trump has also said he might use a government shutdown to eliminate federal programs he opposes. \"A lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" Trump said on Sept. 30. \"We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want.\"\n\nTrump's threats come after his administration has already fired tens of thousands of federal workers as part of his Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to downsize the federal government.\n\n‒ Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/02"}]}

At least 90 people have died in the flooding, according to latest tallies on Monday, July 7.\n\nWhen the flash flood struck early on Friday, about 700 children were in residence at Camp Mystic, according to Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. The camp lies on the banks of the Guadalupe River. Heavy rains hit central-west Texas early Friday, leading to flash flooding in the area around the camp as the river surged nearly 30 feet in less than an hour, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nHere's what we know about the summer camp for girls, as crews continue to pick through the wreckage more than three days after the disaster struck.\n\nWhere is Camp Mystic in Texas?\n\nCamp Mystic for Girls is in Texas, about 6 miles south of Hunt, Texas, in Kerr County. That's within Texas Hill Country, an 11-million-acre region of central-west Texas spanning several counties and cities, named for its grassy and rolling hills, and known as an especially flood-prone area. The original camp sits alongside the Guadalupe River, and a second camp nearby opened in 2020 is near Cypress Lake. Both are bisected by Cypress Creek.\n\nWhat is Camp Mystic? A centuries-old camp for girls.\n\nThe nondenominational Christian camp for girls was founded in 1926 by Edward \"Doc\" Stewart, who was a coach at the University of Texas, according to the camp's website. Except for a short period during during World War II when it served as a \"rehabilitation and recovery camp\" for veterans, it has been in operation ever since.\n\nThe camp, described on its website as \"nestled among cypress, live oak and pecan trees,\" operates three sessions each summer, offering classic summer camp activities including archery, canoeing, arts and crafts, swimming and horseback riding. The girls can also participate in cooking, dance, basketball, lacrosse, soccer and yoga, and religious activities such as Bible studies, Saturday evening Catholic Mass and Sunday morning devotionals along the river.\n\n\"Campers and counselors join together to sing songs, listen to scripture, discover ways to grow spiritually, and learn to apply these lessons to their daily life at camp and back home,\" according to the site.\n\nThe camp has a storied history in the state, and has hosted girls from some of Texas' most famous political families.\n\nThe daughters of three former Texas governors summered at the camp, according to Texas Monthly, and three generations of girls in former President Lyndon B. Johnson's family also attended, the Texas Tribune has reported. A current Republican Congressman announced Saturday two of his daughters were among those evacuated over the weekend, and former First Lady Laura Bush was once a camp counselor there.\n\nJenna Bush Hager speaks about Mystic: 'Texas camps are institutions'\n\nOne of the former first lady's daughters, Jenna Bush Hager, spoke about her connection to Camp Mystic on NBC's \"Today\" show on July 7.\n\n\"My mom was a counselor there, but also so many of my friends were raised at this camp,\" she said. \"Texas camps are institutions, as you just heard, where were many family members − generations − this camp was 100 years old, so grandmothers, mothers, kids have all gone there.\"\n\nHager said her mother was a drama counselor at the camp, and that many of her friends had their kids at Camp Mystic as recently as last week.\n\n\"The stories that I heard over the last couple days were beautiful and heartbreaking,\" she said. \"Texas has a type of resilience where they're generous people, where people want to reach out and help.\"\n\nCamp Mystic director died during Texas floods\n\nCamp Mystic director Richard \"Dick\" Eastland is among those who died during the flooding.\n\nHe and his wife, Tweety, had been running the camps for decades and lived on the property. A former camper and family friend to Eastland, Paige Sumner, wrote about the director in a column in the Kerrville Daily Times published July 5. She said he died while trying to rescue campers.\n\n\"It doesn’t surprise me at all that his last act of kindness and sacrifice was working to save the lives of campers,\" Sumner wrote. \"He had already saved so many lives with the gift of Camp Mystic.\"\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann and Mike Snider, USA TODAY.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

For the latest news on the Texas flooding, read USA TODAY's coverage for Saturday, July 12.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he’d never seen destruction from a disaster as bad as what he saw in Texas after he surveyed the damage of catastrophic flooding that tore across the state's Hill Country and as authorities and volunteers continued to search for the missing.\n\nDuring a roundtable after meeting with victims' families and local officials, Trump recounted how the Guadalupe River overflowed – “a little narrow river becomes a monster.”\n\n\"This is a tough one,\" Trump said. “It’s hard to believe the devastation.\"\n\nThe president applauded emergency officials for their response and rejected concerns about whether communities along the Guadalupe River were adequately prepared for the disaster.\n\n\"Only a very evil person would ask a question like that,\" Trump said.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump said she was moved by meeting with victims' families.\n\n\"We are grieving with you,\" she said at the roundtable. \"Our nation is grieving with you.\"\n\nOver 120 people have been recovered since heavy rainfall overwhelmed the Guadalupe River and flowed through homes and summer camps in the early morning hours of July 4. Ninety-six of those killed were in the hardest-hit county in central Texas, Kerr County, where the toll includes at least 36 children.\n\nState officials vowed to continue searching for over 160 people still missing but have acknowledged the dwindling chances of finding survivors alive a week after the disaster. The last time rescue teams made a \"live rescue\" was on the day the flood broke out.\n\nThe president, first lady and a host of lawmakers and cabinet members made the trip to Texas Friday as questions linger over what could have been done to save more lives from one of the deadliest floods of the last 25 years.\n\nTrump praises 'competence' and 'unity'\n\nTrump dismissed a reporter’s question about whether emergency alerts went out in time before the flooding surged to crisis levels and said people should instead focus on the \"unity” and “competence” displayed after the floods.\n\n“I think everybody did an incredible job under the circumstances,” Trump said. “Only a very evil person would ask a question like that.”\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it a once-in-a-1,000-year flood. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said the reporter's question was \"ridiculous.\"\n\n“We’ll figure out how to make our systems the best they can be,\" he said. Roy said the \"enduring images\" of the flood will be of girls from Camp Mystic singing as they evacuated the scene. “That’s who the people of Texas are,\" he said.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, described a horrifying scene at Camp Mystic, where the water line on a cabin showed the floodwaters rose 8 feet, blowing out the windows and sweeping away the girls inside.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything more horrible in my life,” said Cruz, who said he broke down and wept.\n\nMore potential flooding? Abbott activates state emergency response\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott activated emergency response resources July 11 at the Texas Division of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Texas continues to stand ready to deploy all necessary resources to support Texans as severe storms move across our state,” said Governor Abbott. \"I urge Texans to remain weather-aware and heed the guidance of state and local officials to ensure the safety of themselves and their loved ones.\"\n\nEmergency resources include swiftwater rescue team boats capable of rescuing people swept up in floodwaters.\n\nAbbott activated emergency resources in response to heavy rainfalls the National Weather Service predicted for parts of Northwest Texas, far West Texas, North Texas, the Big Country, Permian Basin, Concho Valley and the Hill Country, the same area devastated by the Fourth of July floods.\n\nRainfall is expected to begin overnight and continue through the weekend, Abbott said.\n\nOfficials vow to rebuild\n\nJohn Dunn, the longtime owner of The Hunt Store in Kerrville, told Trump he planned to rebuild the beloved spot despite concerns from patrons that it was a total loss.\n\n“I’m absolutely going to bring it back,” Dunn said of the store he sold earlier this year. “We’re going to get it opened very quickly.”\n\n“We will rebuild the Hunt Store right here,” Gov, Greg Abbott said, doubling down on Dunn's remarks. “We are going to rebuild this community.”\n\nMore than 12,000 volunteers have flocked to Kerrville County to help with search and recovery efforts and 19 states have sent resources, Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas division of emergency management, told Trump.\n\nTexas flags fly at half-mast from Alamo\n\nOfficials at the Alamo fort in San Antonio lowered the Texas state flag to half-mast, according to videos shared by staffers on social media.\n\n“Our hearts are with the families and communities of the Hill Country,” fort staffers said in a post from the official Alamo X account.\n\nThe fort is a U.S. National Historic Landmark and UNESCO World Heritage Site, according to the National Park Service.\n\nAmong Texans it holds a deeply symbolic significance. A small group fighting for independence from Mexico was “annihilated” there in 1836, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. The death of figures at the fort, including former Tennessee congressman David “Davy” Crockett, became a rallying cry for the state: “Remember the Alamo.”\n\nTrump spoke with families of victims\n\nThe president arrived at a roundtable discussion with first responders late Friday afternoon after meeting with the relatives of the flood victims. Trump sat behind a black banner marked with the phrase “Texas Strong.”\n\n“I think this is a good reason to be late,” Trump said, sitting behind a black banner that read “Texas Strong.”\n\nThe first lady said young girls gave her a bracelet they made to honor victims of the floods and vowed to return to Texas' Hill Country.\n\n\"We are here to honor them,\" she said of the campers and counselors who passed away.\n\nTexas man threatens Trump: ‘I won’t miss’\n\nA San Antonio man was charged July 10 for allegedly threatening President Donald Trump, the Justice Department announced.\n\nRobert Herrera, 52, commented on a San Antonio news outlet’s Facebook post pertaining to Trump’s planned visit to the Texas Hill Country, according to court records.\n\n“I won’t miss,” Herrera allegedly posted, along with a picture of Trump surrounded by Secret Service agents immediately after the July 13, 2024, assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter an exchange with another poster, Herrera allegedly posted a picture of an assault rifle with loaded magazines.\n\nHerrera was charged with making threats against a president and making interstate threatening communications. He faces a maximum five years in prison on each charge if convicted.\n\n“To be clear, these types of threats will not be taken lightly, and we will always take a swift, aggressive approach, as was done here,” U.S. Attorney Justin Simmons said in the Western District of Texas.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump talks with first responders in Kerrville, Texas\n\nShortly after Trump arrived in Texas, his motorcade stopped near the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, where an overturned tractor trailer and numerous downed trees littered the area, according to reporters traveling with him.\n\nSimilar debris was visible throughout the president's drive from the Kerrville-Kerr County airport to the river. Pockets of residents standing in strip-mall parking lots waved as the president drove by them.\n\nAt Louise Hays Park, Trump, the first lady and Gov. Greg Abbott stood next to a red-and-white engine from the Kerrville Fire Department as they listened and nodded to a 10-minute briefing. Trump shook hands with about 30 emergency workers after the briefing and posed for pictures.\n\nTrump and the first lady then met with dozens of federal, state and local officials at the Happy State Bank Expo Hall in Kerrville, where he later hosted a round table. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and GOP Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz were among the attendees.\n\n- Bart Jansen and Joey Garrison\n\nHouse Democrats request comms related to Texas flood response\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee have called on multiple government agencies to produce documents and communications about the lead-up and response to the deadly Texas floods.\n\nIn a series of letters, Texas Reps. Greg Casar and Jasmine Crockett – backed by ranking member Robert Garcia, of California, – expressed concern over FEMA's response to the crisis and the potential impacts of DOGE cuts on the National Weather Service.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned not only that Secretary Noem may have effectively crippled the agency’s ability to respond to this crisis, but also that she failed to personally act to ensure a timely response,\" the members wrote in a letter to FEMA. Other letters were sent to the Department of Commerce Inspector General and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe White House on Friday said that FEMA has $13 billion in reserves that it can draw on to assist victims of the Texas floods.\n\nHow many deaths from Texas flooding?\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Texas flooding death toll, according to county officials:\n\nKerr County: 96\n\nTravis County: 8\n\nKendall County: 8\n\nBurnet County: 5\n\nWilliamson County: 3\n\nTom Green County: 1\n\nAbbott announces crisis line for Texas flood victims\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday announced a 24/7 crisis support line for residents impacted by the deadly floods that pummeled the state one week ago.\n\nThe Texas Flooding Emotional Support Line will provide callers with professional crisis counseling at no cost, according to the governor's office. Counselors will also help residents review their disaster recovery options and provide referrals to other programs. \"This new statewide crisis support line will ensure survivors, families, and first responders have access to emotional support and crisis counseling as they work to heal and recover,\" Abbott said in a statement.\n\nPresident Trump departs for Texas Hill Country\n\nAboard Air Force One, Trump left Washington Friday morning en route to Texas, where he plans to meet with family members of flood victims, first responders and local officials.\n\nAccompanying Trump on the trip are Republican Texas U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner and Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler.\n\n\"Nobody can even believe it, such a thing,\" Trump said before boarding Air Force Once. \"That much water that fast – without a dam break. You’d think a dam would have break for it to happen. A terrible thing.\"\n\nOver $30 million in donations received by Kerr County flood relief fund\n\nThe Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country has received more than $30 million in donations through the Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, organizers announced Friday.\n\nTexas Rep. Chip Roy thanked those who've donated to the fund and said he expects the donation totals to grow in the coming days as recovery operations continue across the region. He urged more people to donate to the relief fund, citing a challenging road to recovery.\n\n\"We're going to rebuild and we're going to be back better than ever,\" he said.\n\nWhite House says FEMA has enough money for Texas flood relief\n\nAhead of Trump’s Friday visit to Texas, the White House’s budget chief told reporters the Federal Emergency Management Agency has the funding to assist in flood recovery efforts even as the Trump administration has talked about eliminating FEMA.\n\nRuss Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said FEMA has about $13 billion in its reserves to pay for necessary expenses in Texas.\n\n“The president has said to Texas, anything it needs it will get,” Vought said, adding that, “We also want FEMA to be reformed. We want FEMA to work well … The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of his agencies.\"\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday continued her call for FEMA to be eliminated in its current form. Her push comes as FEMA has deployed specialists and distributed supplies to the flooded areas in Texas.\n\n\"Federal emergency management should be state and locally led, rather than how it has operated for decades,\" Noem said.\n\n\"It has been slow to respond at the federal level. It's even been slower to get the resources to Americans in crisis, and that is why this entire agency needs to be eliminated as it exists today, and remade into a responsive agency.\"\n\nKerr County was denied money to upgrade flood warning system\n\nNearly a decade before disastrous floods ravaged the Texas Hill Country, the state’s Division of Emergency Management denied requests from Kerr County for a $1 million grant to improve its flood warning system, records show.\n\nIn 2017, Kerr County requested the funds to build a flood warning system that would have upgraded 20 water gauge systems, added new water level sensors and posts, and created software and a website to distribute the information to the public in real-time.\n\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management denied Kerr County’s initial application, meeting minutes show. Kerr County applied again the following year, in 2018, when more federal funding became available after Hurricane Harvey. But meeting minutes indicate that Texas’ emergency authority again did not approve it.\n\nThe Division of Emergency Management did not answer USA TODAY's specific questions about why the county's applications were rejected.\n\n– Kenny Jacoby\n\nFAA issues flight restrictions over Texas Hill Country amid search effort\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary flight restriction for counties in the Texas Hill County where search teams are traversing mangled riverbanks to recover victims of the deadly floods. The order restricts the use of aircrafts and drones operating without permission over the search area.\n\nWhile drones have enabled rescuers to scour parts of the disaster zone that are otherwise inaccessible, unauthorized aircraft have hindered recovery efforts.\n\nOn Monday, July 7, a drone illegally operating in restricted airspace crashed into a helicopter involved in emergency operations. The helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing and is out of service “until further notice,” according to Kerr County. No injuries were reported.\n\nOfficials urge residents not to touch large debris piles amid search\n\nKerr County officials asked residents to avoid large debris piles until they've been searched thoroughly by crews scouring for flood victims.\n\n\"We are still looking for victims. If a pile is large enough to need heavy equipment to clean ... have the city send a search team to check the pile first,\" read a statement on the flood taskforce website. \"This applies to big tangles where a person could be. Smaller piles are fine to be cleaned up.\"\n\nThis week search crews have shifted their focus to untangling towering mounds of wreckage along the Guadalupe River and throughout Kerr County, where at least 96 people have been killed.\n\nWhat we know about the Texas flood victims\n\nA director of a Texas summer camp for girls who was known as the \"heart and soul\" of the program. Two grade-school age sisters found together after being swept away. A 23-year-old Texas police officer celebrating the Fourth of July with his family.\n\nThese are some of the more than 120 people killed by the disastrous floods that swept across the Texas Hill Country one week ago. Flooding-related deaths have been reported in at least six counties. The victims include summer camp directors, teachers, grandparents, parents and dozens of children.\n\nRead the stories of those who lost their lives here.\n\nTrump says expresses support for alarm system after Texas floods\n\nIn an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on Thursday, Trump said the Texas flood was a \"once-in-every-200-year\" event and said he supported the installation of an alarm system to warn of such emergencies.\n\n\"After having seen this horrible event, I would imagine you’d put alarms up in some form,\" Trump told NBC’s Meet the Press on Thursday ahead of the trip, noting, \"local officials were hit by this just like everybody else.\"\n\nQuestions remain about what more could have been done to warn residents of the flooding, which surged the Guadalupe River nearly 30 feet in less than an hour. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's legislative agenda for an upcoming special session includes discussions on flood warning systems, communications and natural disaster preparation and recovery.\n\nWhat we know about Trump's Texas visit\n\nTrump plans to visit the area on Friday, July 11, and meet with family members of flood victims and first responders during his trip, according to a White House official. Trump will also participate in a briefing and roundtable from local elected officials, the official said.\n\nTrump and the first lady will land in Kerr County at 12:20 p.m., according to an official schedule.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, Kathryn Palmer, Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/07/10/texas-flood-relief-nfl-teams-donations/84542537007/", "title": "Texas flood relief: List of NFL teams contributing donations", "text": "July 10, 2025, 9:41 p.m. ET\n\nThe NFL is coming together to donate to the relief efforts in Texas.\n\nKerr County and the Texas Hill Country saw catastrophic flood waters from the Guadalupe River sweep through their area during the early morning hours of July 4.\n\nHeavy rainfall overwhelmed the area, damaging homes and youth camps – including Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp that lost at least 27 campers and counselors. At least 120 people have been confirmed dead, with more than 160 still unaccounted for, according to officials.\n\nAs search and recovery efforts continue, the region is getting a boost from teams on the gridiron, who have pledged their support.\n\nThe Houston Texans were the first to announce their donations on Saturday, July 5, with more coming throughout the week. The Dallas Cowboys and the NFL Foundation joined the Texans on Sunday, July 6, with each contributing $500,000 in a $1.5 million total donation.\n\nTeams from other leagues have gotten involved as well, hoping to help the community in the aftermath of the tragedy.

Hunt, who also owns Major League Soccer's FC Dallas, joined Austin FC, Houston Dynamo FC and MLS as part of the group donation.\n\n“Our family is devastated by the tragedy in Central Texas,” Hunt said in a statement. “Our hearts go out to those grieving – in particular, to the parents who lost children, those who lost family members, and the far-too-many who have lost friends, neighbors, and loved ones.\n\n“This has shaken our community to its core. Today, along with our MLS partners, my brother and I are humbled to support those directly assisting the victims of this unimaginable tragedy.

For the latest news on the Texas floods, read USA TODAY's coverage for Monday, July 7.\n\nAuthorities on Sunday were in a desperate search to find those still missing after historic flash floods swept across central Texas — including 10 children from a beloved all-girls camp — as the death toll rose and forecasters warned of more rain.\n\nState and local authorities said at least 81 people have died in flooding triggered by unrelenting rain Thursday night into Friday. As of Sunday afternoon, Sheriff Larry Leitha of Kerr County, where the worst of the flooding occurred, said authorities had recovered the bodies of 40 adults and 28 children.\n\nAmong those still missing were 10 children and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp at the edge of the Guadalupe River, which surged over 26 feet in less than an hour as storms dumped six months' worth of rain over the Texas Hill Country.\n\nIt's unclear how many people were missing in the communities along the Guadalupe, where local officials say thousands of people came from out of town to celebrate Independence Day weekend. Forecasters expect several more inches of rain on Sunday and warned of additional flooding and a worsening of conditions on the ground.\n\nAt least 41 people were known to be missing across the state and areas affected by the flooding, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. The governor noted that search and rescue efforts were still underway.\n\n\"There were so many people who were just camping out — not children in camps — but adults camping out near the river, people in RVs and things like that,\" Abbott said. \"There are people who are missing, who are not on the known, confirmed missing because we don't yet know who they are.\"\n\nFor days, crews have been working around the clock to find the missing, traversing swollen waterways and scouring riverbanks littered with mangled trees and rubble. Rescuers have pulled residents from rooftops and found survivors clinging to trees. As of Sunday, about 650 people have been rescued, officials said.\n\n\"We will continue our search efforts until everybody is found,\" Leitha vowed.\n\nWhat Texas cities flooded? Here's where the most rain fell this weekend\n\nTrump deflects on FEMA's future\n\nAfter raising the prospect of abolishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency earlier this year, President Donald Trump deflected when asked if he wants to phase out the agency.\n\n\"FEMA is something we can talk about later,\" Trump told reporters. \"But right now they’re busy working so we’ll leave it at that.\"\n\nFEMA was activated in Texas after Trump declared a major disaster area in Kerr County following devastating flooding. The president said he plans to visit Texas later this week.\n\nWhile touring flood damage in North Carolina in January, Trump commented that \"I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away.\" In Los Angeles, which was devastated by wildfires, Trump added: \"I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government.\"\n\nCameron Hamilton, Trump’s former acting FEMA administrator, said during a congressional hearing in May that he opposed abolishing the agency. The Department of Homeland Security later announced that Hamilton was being replaced as the head of FEMA.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nReport: Granddaughters of ex-Detroit Free Press publisher among killed\n\nThe twin granddaughters of David Lawrence Jr., the former publisher of the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, were among the dozens killed during massive flooding in Central Texas, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nThe girls, both 8 years old, and their sister, 14, attended Camp Mystic in Kerr County, the newspaper reported Sunday. Officials said earlier in the day that ten campers and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp at the edge of the Guadalupe River, remain unaccounted for.\n\n\"It has been an unimaginable time for all of us,\" Lawrence told the Herald. \"Hanna and Rebecca gave their parents, John and Lacy, and sister, Harper, and all in our family, so much joy. They and that joy can never be forgotten.\"\n\n— Charles A. Ventura\n\nResidents urged to remain vigilant amid ongoing risk of flooding\n\nThe Williamson County Office of Emergency Management urged residents to remain vigilant amid the dangers of ongoing flooding. The agency said the county was under a flood watch through 10 p.m. local time on Sunday and advised motorists not to drive past barricades or through water flowing over a road.\n\nThe county confirmed on Sunday that two people died due to flooding. The first victim, identified as 22-year-old Kaitlyn Swallow, was recovered late Saturday by the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nFollowing another day of searching, the county said the body of another person was recovered and one person was still missing.\n\n\"My heart goes out to those who lost their loved ones in the devastating floods over the holiday weekend,\" County Judge Steven Snell said in a statement. \"We have a long way to go in this recovery phase, but I know Williamson County is a caring and resilient community. The outpouring of support from the public to those impacted is humbling.”\n\nTrump said he expects to visit Texas later this week after catastrophic flooding caused extensive death and destruction in the state.\n\n\"Probably on Friday,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday when asked about visiting the state. \"We wanted to leave a little time. I would’ve done it today, but we’d just be in their way.\"\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Trump signed a major disaster declaration for hard-hit Kerr County.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nKerr County officials continue search and rescue operations\n\nThe Kerr County Sheriff's Office said search and rescue operations continued on Sunday with a \"full response from local, state, and national first responders.\"\n\n\"We continue to have hundreds of officers, deputies, and support staff working every aspect of this emergency, along with air, water, K9, and other assets conducting search and rescue,\" the sheriff's office said in an update Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe sheriff's office noted that there was additional rain in the upper Guadalupe basin, leading to a rise in Johnson Creek that may result in a rise of 1 to 2 feet downstream when it enters the Guadalupe River in the small city of Ingram.\n\nAs of 1:30 p.m. local time, the sheriff's office said authorities recovered 68 bodies in Kerr County, including 40 adults and 28 children. Eighteen adults and 10 children are pending identification.\n\n\"We continue to offer our condolences to those affected, and we are working tirelessly to reunite families,\" the sheriff's office said. \"We know there are many people concerned and affected by this tragic situation.\"\n\nGov. Abbott warns of dangers for the next 24 to 48 hours\n\nAbbott and other state emergency officials held Sunday's news conference in the city of Austin due to the deadly storms that have swept across central Texas and more expected storms that will \"pose life-threatening danger over the next 24 to 48 hours.\"\n\nThe governor advised the public to remain \"extraordinarily\" cautious and follow safety guidelines as heavy rainfall and additional flash flooding were expected across the Concho Valley and near Kerrville.\n\n“If you’re in any of those regions, you need to realize, for one, you’re in an area that is already saturated with water,“ he added. \"But for another, when more water comes down, it could lead to rapid flash flooding events. Now, there's nothing expected at this time to the magnitude of what was seen in Kerrville. That said flash flooding can occur at lower levels of water than what happened in Kerrville.\"\n\nAuthorities search for missing people\n\nTexas officials urged the public and residents to contact local authorities to provide name identification and other information about a person who is suspected to be missing.\n\nThe missing included two people each in Williamson and Burnet counties, near Austin, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Director Freeman Martin. The two people missing in Burnet County were identified as Michael Phillips, chief of the Marble Falls Area Volunteer Fire Department, and a 17-year-old girl.\n\nMajor General Thomas Suelzer, with the Texas Military Department, said the department conducted a total of 525 rescues or evacuations, including 366 by air and 159 by ground, as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nA community ravaged: In Texas Hill Country, deluge leaves a heartbreaking toll\n\nWarnings for deadly Texas flash flooding came with little time to act\n\nFor the meteorologists and hydrologists tracking the weather patterns that led to the deadly Independence Day floods in the Texas Hill Country, the most urgent advisories weren’t deployed until it was almost too late, according to interviews and advisories.\n\nForecasters said they pushed out warnings as fast as they got the data. But the hilly terrain and the trickiness of predicting flash floods made forecasting — and alerting communities along the Guadalupe River in real time — particularly challenging.\n\n\"This is a problem that we are constantly trying to work on: how to better communicate,\" Greg Waller, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service’s West Gulf River Forecast Center in Fort Worth, told USA TODAY. \"We can issue the best forecast in the world, but if it's not put in the hands of the individuals so they can make the best decision, that forecast has little value.\" Read more here.\n\n– Rick Jervis\n\nFlood survivor: 'I could see the water coming in'\n\nKeri Patton awoke to the sound of water crashing through her San Angelo home. Seemingly without warning, 18 feet of floodwater quickly enveloped her house on the morning of July Fourth after the Lake View area saw a record-breaking 14 inches of rainfall in only a few hours.\n\n\"I could see the water coming in, gushing from every direction,\" Patton told the San Angelo Standard-Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. “I was like, 'I gotta get out.' Everything was underwater. And when I left, I couldn’t get the gate open from the water. When we finally got my truck out, (water) was up to the bottom of the doors.\"\n\nBefore Patton escaped, she called her sister Laura Debusk, who lives in Clovis, New Mexico. She found shelter at a nearby friend’s house while Debusk made the five-hour drive to San Angelo.\n\nWhen Debusk arrived at Patton’s house, the water level had reached its maximum height. The house was partially submerged in 4 to 5 feet of water.\n\n\"I’ve helped her build her dream house, and this is what it is,\" Debusk said. \"This is her life, and I’m doing everything I can to give it back to her.\"\n\n— Paul Witwer, San Angelo Standard-Times\n\nFEMA offers disaster assistance to Texas flood victims\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency announced disaster assistance for those who’ve been impacted by flooding in Kerr County.\n\nThe federal agency said assistance includes grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans, among other programs. The announcement came after President Donald Trump signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, the epicenter of the violent flash floods.\n\nTrump said in June that he plans to phase out FEMA after the hurricane season and floated eliminating the agency. He has criticized the agency as being ineffective and said he wants it to \"give out less money\" to states responding to natural disasters.\n\nGeorge W. Bush says he's 'heartbroken' over deadly Texas floods\n\nFormer President George W. Bush said he and his wife, Laura, are \"heartbroken by the loss of life and the agony so many are feeling.\"\n\n\"Those who have lost their precious children are facing a grief no parents should ever know,\" Bush, a former Texas governor, said in a statement. \"We are grateful to the first responders and volunteers who are working to find the missing and comfort the grieving at Camp Mystic and along the Guadalupe. We know our words cannot help, but we believe the prayers of so many Americans will.\"\n\nFormer first lady Laura Bush reportedly worked as a counselor at Camp Mystic while she was a student at Southern Methodist University, according to Texas Monthly.\n\nFlash flood advisories and warnings abound as Texas faces more rain\n\nMillions in central Texas were under flash flood advisories as forecasters warned of several more inches of rain, including in hard-hit parts of the state. The weather alerts stretched from San Antonio to the Fort Worth area.\n\nForecasters with the National Weather Service said flood watches have been extended until 10 p.m. local time in parts of Hill Country and the I-35 corridor as they anticipate widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches. The agency warned that excessive runoff may result in dangerous flash flooding of low-lying areas, rivers, creeks, and low water crossings.\n\nThe weather service in Austin and San Antonio advised the public to have multiple methods to receive warnings. Earlier on Sunday afternoon, the agency said scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms were expected with the heaviest activity located over the Hill Country.\n\nThe agency said in an update at 8 p.m. that thunderstorms with very heavy rainfall continued to push across the I-35 corridor.\n\nCongressman says his granddaughters' cousin died in Camp Mystic flood\n\nU.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Georgia, said his granddaughters’ cousin died in the flooding that tore through Camp Mystic over the weekend.\n\nCarter said in a post on X that his granddaughters were at the popular all-girls summer camp when the nearby Guadalupe River rose nearly 30 feet on Friday.\n\nHis granddaughters managed to escape, but their cousin, Janie, did not survive, Carter said.\n\n\"My granddaughters lost their cousin, Janie, and many other families are grieving loved ones,\" he said. \"Please join me in prayers for Texas. We must ensure that they have the resources they need to find those still missing and save lives.\"\n\nHow many people have died in the Texas flooding?\n\nBelow are the latest numbers of reported fatalities from state and local officials across central Texas.\n\nKerr County – 68 deaths\n\nTravis County – 5 deaths\n\nBurnet County – 3 deaths\n\nKendall County – 2 deaths\n\nWilliamson County - 2 deaths\n\nTom Green County – 1 death\n\nTrump signs disaster declaration for Kerr County after deadly floods\n\nTrump said in a statement Sunday that he signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, unlocking federal funding that the president says will ensure first responders \"immediately have the resources they need.\"\n\n\"These families are enduring an unimaginable tragedy, with many lives lost, and many still missing,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"The Trump Administration continues to work closely with State and Local Leaders.\"\n\nHe also praised the U.S. Coast Guard, which, together with state first responders, has rescued more than 850 people in central Texas since the disastrous flooding began. \"GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!\" Trump said.\n\nBeloved soccer coach, wife among dead; their children remain missing\n\nReece Zunker, the coach of a high school boys soccer team in Kerrville, and his wife, Paula, are among the dozens killed in the flooding that has ravaged central Texas. Their two children are reportedly missing.\n\nThe Tivy High School soccer team said in a statement that it was “heartbroken with the loss of our leader and inspiration.”\n\n“Coach Reece Zunker was not just a soccer coach, he was a mentor, teacher and a role model for our Kerrville kids,” the statement said, crediting him with rebuilding the school’s soccer program. “His passion for his players, students, co-workers, community and his family will never be forgotten.”\n\nMultiple local news outlets reported that the family’s two children are still missing. The family was spending Independence Day weekend at a house on the Guadalupe River between Camp La Junta and Camp Mystic, according to the Kerrville Daily Times.\n\nSan Angelo resident recalls waking up to record-breaking flooding\n\nLuis Maldonado heard rain around midnight Friday in San Angelo and thought nothing of it. But around 4 a.m., the father of three woke up and realized water was seeping through the family’s new carpet.\n\n\"I turn on the light, and I just hear a squishing as I keep stepping,\" Luis told the San Angelo Standard-Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"I turn on more lights, and I just see water all over the ground.\"\n\nLuis immediately woke up his wife. Then he opened his front door and saw a wall of water rushing through the neighborhood. Maldonado, whose truck and minivan were also flooded in the deluge, was one of many people filling out relief paperwork at a church in the west-central Texas city of San Angelo.\n\nLocal officials said over 12,000 homes have been damaged in the flooding, and one death in San Angelo has been tied to the storm.\n\n– Ronald W. Erdrich and Trish Choate, San Angelo Standard-Times\n\nPope Leo XIV offers condolences to families of flood victims\n\nPope Leo XIV issued a statement on social media offering his condolences to the families of those killed in the historic Texas flooding.\n\n\"I would like to express sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters, who were at the summer camp, in the disaster caused by flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States,\" the pope wrote on X. \"We pray for them.\"\n\nLeo, who was elected as the head of the Roman Catholic Church in May, is the first U.S.-born pontiff.\n\nAbbott visits 'ravaged' Camp Mystic, vows to find missing children\n\nAbbott said on X that he visited Camp Mystic and the nearby Guadalupe River and was stunned by the devastation.\n\nThe girls' camp was \"horrendously ravaged in ways unlike I’ve seen in any natural disaster,\" the governor said late Saturday, adding: \"The height the rushing water reached to the top of cabins was shocking.\"\n\nAbbott, who issued a disaster declaration for nearly two dozen Texas counties, said: \"We won’t stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins.\"\n\nNew bouts of rain could worsen deluge, trigger new flooding\n\nMore rain was expected to fall Sunday across the Texas Hill Country, threatening to trigger new floods and worsen the deluge in the devastated, rain-soaked region.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Austin and San Antonio said flood watches were extended into Sunday when 2 to 4 inches of rain were expected to fall across parts of the region. Some isolated areas could see as much as 10 inches of rain.\n\n\"Any additional heavy rain will lead to flash flooding where it occurs and downstream,\" the weather service said.\n\nRescue crews focus on missing campers\n\nRescue crews worked feverishly at the site of Camp Mystic. The camp had 700 girls in residence at the time of the flood, according to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\n\nNick Sorter, a member of the volunteer rescue group United Cajun Navy, told CNN that \"there was nowhere for these kids to go. The buildings were washed out, just carved out from the inside.\"\n\nElinor Lester, 13, told the Associated Press the camp \"was completely destroyed. A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”\n\nWhere is Texas Hill Country? A rolling grassland with history of floods\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Antonio said the risk of flash flooding remains in Hill Country, a low-lying and flood-sensitive area of west-central Texas.\n\nThe region stretches over 11 million acres across 18 counties in central Texas, according to the Texas Hill Country Conservation Network. It includes the cities of San Antonio and Austin, as well as extensive rural areas such as the site of the July Fourth flooding in Kerr County. The cities of Sonora, Fredericksburg, San Marcos, Bandera, and New Braunfels are also located within the region.\n\nTexas Hill Country mainly sits atop the Edwards Plateau and is named for the area’s grassy rolling hills. Three rivers — the Colorado, Nueces, and Guadalupe — run through the area. Friday’s devastating flash floods engorged the banks of the Guadalupe.\n\nThe area is known for being especially vulnerable to floods, earning it the nickname \"flash flood alley,\" and it has experienced several major flood events in the past two decades.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\n'It wasn't slowing': Witness recalls a torrent of water\n\nTonia Fucci, a Pennsylvania resident visiting her grandmother for the Independence Day weekend, woke early Friday to the sound of heavy rain \"coming down in buckets.\"\n\nShe heard something more ominous: loud, startling cracking noises.\n\n\"It's indescribable, the sounds, of how loud they were, which turned out to be ... the massive cypress trees that came down along the river,\" she told Reuters.\n\nFucci, who was staying near the Guadalupe River, filmed on her phone a torrent of muddy water flooding the road to her grandmother's house. She said she received National Weather alerts on her phone hours after the flood had already hit. She recalled residents running to their neighbors to help before rescue teams arrived.\n\n\"Something I've never seen before. You knew it was tragedy,\" Fucci said. \"It wasn't slowing, it wasn't slowing. And debris and furniture and RVs were coming down the river.\"\n\nHeartbreaking photos of devastation at camp\n\nPhotos inside the nearly century-old Camp Mystic revealed a horrifying picture of the devastation that unfolded.\n\nCampers' bunkbeds were caked in mud; bed sheets, clothing, and suitcases were jumbled about the rooms. One wall of a camp building had been ripped from the foundation.\n\nOne Camp Mystic camper, 8-year-old Sarah Marsh of Alabama, was confirmed among the dead, according to Mountain Brook, Alabama, Mayor Stewart Welch. Janie Hunt, 9, was also among the dead, The New York Times and CNN both reported.\n\nOther campers were also reported dead by news outlets.\n\nA beloved camp among Texas families\n\nGenerations of Texas families sent their daughters to Camp Mystic, a place where they formed lifelong friendships, former camper Clair Cannon told USA TODAY. Cannon's mother and daughter both also attended.\n\nSummer after summer, they'd take Highway 39 as it winds along the Guadalupe River until arriving at the grounds on the riverbank.\n\n“What that area is like when it’s in its prime − when it’s not devastated like this − is probably one of the most serene and peaceful places that I’ve ever seen in my life,” said Cannon, a commercial and residential real estate agent in Dallas.\n\nAnother girls' camp a few miles away from Mystic, Heart O' the Hills, said on its website that co-owner Jane Ragsdale had died in the flood. The camp was not in session when the flooding hit, and officials said everyone else had been accounted for.\n\nWhy is Texas flooding so bad?\n\nTexas Hill Country is no stranger to extreme flooding. In the rugged, rolling terrain it’s known for, heavy rains collect quickly in its shallow streams and rivers that can burst into torrents like the deadly flood wave that swept along the Guadalupe River on July Fourth.\n\nThe Guadalupe has flooded more than a dozen times since 1978, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, but the Independence Day flood is among the worst in its history.\n\nSeveral factors came together at once – in one of the worst possible locations – to create the “horrifying” scenario that dropped up to 16 inches of rainfall in the larger region over July 3 to July 5, said Alan Gerard, a recently retired storm specialist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

We will not put a number on the other side because we just don’t know.”\n\nPatrick also said up to 500 rescue workers were searching for an unknown number of missing people, including some who had come to the area for an Independence Day celebration along the river.\n\n“We don't know how many people were in tents on the side, in small trailers by the side, in rented homes by the side because it was going to be the Fourth of July holiday,\" he said on Fox & Friends Weekend.\n\nSan Angelo also swamped with floodwaters\n\nThe devastation extended beyond Kerrville. About 150 miles away, the community of San Angelo and surrounding Tom Green County were hit with a record-breaking 14 inches of rain.\n\nPolice discovered the body of Tanya Burwick, 62, on Saturday, several blocks from her SUV, which was engulfed in 12 feet of water during Friday's flood, San Angelo police said.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy as we extend our deepest condolences to Ms. Burwick’s family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,\" police said in the media release. \"The San Angelo Police Department stands with the entire community in mourning this tragic loss.\"\n\n− Trish Choate\n\nWere there any warnings before the flooding?\n\nThe extreme flooding struck before dawn with little or no warning, Rice said, precluding authorities from issuing advance evacuation orders.\n\nState emergency management officials had warned as early as Thursday that west and central Texas faced heavy rains and flash flood threats, citing National Weather Service forecasts ahead of the holiday weekend.\n\nThe forecasts, however, \"did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,\" W.

For the latest news on the Texas flooding, read USA TODAY's coverage for Friday, July 11.\n\nThe community of Kerrville, Texas, ravaged by the catastrophic flooding of the Guadalupe River nearly a week ago, was mourning its losses Thursday as rescue teams continue the grueling task of recovering the remains of missing victims.\n\nAt least 120 people have been found dead since heavy rainfall overwhelmed the river and flowed through homes and youth camps in the early morning hours of July 4. Ninety-six of those killed were in the hardest-hit county in central Texas, Kerr County, where the toll includes at least 36 children.\n\nMore than 160 people are still missing in the county, officials said in a Thursday update, and hopes of finding any survivors have diminished with each passing day. County authorities say they haven't made a \"live rescue\" since the day of the flood.\n\nAmong the missing are five campers and a counselor from the Christian girls camp, Camp Mystic, which counted at least 27 children and staff among the death toll.\n\nKerr County authorities and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have pledged that search crews will continue working until every missing person is found. They've also faced tough questions about who is to blame for the little warning about the catastrophic floods.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, crowds gathered at a Kerrville high school for a vigil to pray for the victims and missing.\n\n“The kingdom of God looks like thousands of volunteers walking along the riverbanks clearing a path,” Kerrville resident Josh Smithson, director of the Christian youth outreach organization Young Life, said at the vigil. “The kingdom of God looks like Kerr County rising together in a time of need.”\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said two more natives of Mexico who lived in the U.S. have been reported among the missing in the flooding, and he added that Mexico has sent another brigade to help with relief efforts.\n\n∎ A couple from Mobile, Alabama, and their 5-year-old granddaughter are among the missing after the cabin where they were staying was swept away from a campground in Kerrville, Texas, the Montgomery Advertiser, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. The newspaper also said the couple's son survived but his wife was found dead.\n\nTrump to meet first responders, families of flood victims\n\nPresident Donald Trump plans to meet with family members of flood victims and first responders during his trip Friday to central Texas, a White House official said.\n\nTrump will also receive a briefing and take part in a roundtable discussion with local officials, according to the administration official. Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott is also expected to attend.\n\nThe White House has not said at what time Trump will arrive in Texas, where 120 people have been confirmed dead and another 160 people are still missing after heavy rainfall overwhelmed the Guadalupe River in and around Kerr County in the early morning hours of July 4.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nPetition for storm warning system gets 40,000 signatures\n\nNearly 40,000 people have essentially said they won't accept any rejections of their demands for a storm warning system in Texas' Hill Country, signing an urgent petition to that effect.\n\nA request for $1 million in state funding to pay for a siren system was turned down less than a decade ago despite the area's propensity for flash flooding. Last weekend's calamity when the Guadalupe River overran its banks, resulting in flooding that caused 120 confirmed deaths, has increased the volume in calls for ways to alert residents of impending danger.\n\n\"A well-placed siren system will provide critical extra minutes for families, schools, camps, businesses, and visitors to seek shelter and evacuate when needed,'' said Nicole Wilson of San Antonio, who started the petition hoping to get 1,000 signatures. \"This is not just a wish ‒ it is a necessary investment in public safety.\"\n\n− Terry Collins\n\nShould your car insurance cover flooding damage?\n\nA vehicle is typically the second most valuable possession for many people, after their home. And whether it's a car, truck or SUV, vehicles can sustain considerable damage in a flood.\n\nExposure to flooding can result in several major mechanical issues and may even make the vehicle dangerous to drive. According to Kelley Blue Book, water can destroy electrical and mechanical systems, and contaminated lubricants can lead to mold, rust and corrosion over time.\n\nSo, is it worthwhile to insure a car against flooding?

Abbott says flood relief, warning systems on legislative agenda\n\nAbbott released his agenda for a special session of Texas lawmakers set to begin July 21, and said topics would include pressing questions raised by the deadly July 4 floods.\n\n\"There is more work to be done, particularly in the aftermath of the devastating floods in the Texas Hill Country. We must ensure better preparation for such events in the future.\" Abbott said.\n\nAsked earlier in the week about who is responsible for the heavy death toll in an area known to be prone for flooding, Abbott took umbrage with the use of the word \"blame.\"\n\n\"That’s the word choice of losers,\" Abbott said on Tuesday before launching into an analogy about the state’s most beloved sport, football, and how different teams respond to hardships. \"The losing teams are the ones that try to point out who’s to blame,'' he said. \"The championship teams are the ones that say, 'Don’t worry about it, man, we’ve got this. We’re going to make sure that we go score again and we’re going to win this game.'\"\n\nIn his agenda, Abbott included four items related to the flooding under the headings of \"flood warning systems,'' \"flood emergency communications,'' \"relief funding for Hill Country floods'' and \"natural disaster preparation and recovery.''\n\nDrier weather finally arrives in Hill Country\n\nLong-awaited dry conditions are expected across areas of Texas ravaged by floods through the rest of the week, the National Weather Service office serving Austin and San Antonio said Thursday.\n\nThe break in rainy, stormy conditions comes after flash flooding continued to threaten recovery efforts through Wednesday night.\n\nThe drier conditions are expected to last through Friday before more rain is in the weekend forecast. There could still be isolated, pop-up storms through the end of the week, AccuWeather reported. Concerns for search crews will shift to the heat, which could make temperatures feel like they're into the triple digits, the outlet said.\n\nCamp Mystic counselors protected young girls from Texas floods\n\nTwo 19-year-old Camp Mystic counselors from Mexico are being recognized for their heroism shielding young girls from the unfolding tragedy.\n\nSilvana Garza and María Paula Zárate were watching girls in the camp's newer site up in the hills – and away from the original campsite down by the Guadalupe River – when the crisis began in the early hours of July 4. Heavy rainfall knocked out the camp's power. The storm sounded like a scary movie, Garza said later.\n\nFor hours, the counselors sang songs and played games with the girls in their care, unaware the campsite near the river, where they had slept just the week before, had been destroyed.\n\nAround 6 p.m., they learned more flooding was on the way. They instructed the girls to pack their belongings and prepare to evacuate. Then, a grim task: They wrote the girls' names on their bodies, Zárate said. That way authorities could identify them if they were swept away and found unresponsive. Their families would have them back, dead or alive.\n\nAs they passed through the campsite by the river and on to safety, Garza told Univision 41, they saw mattresses and clothes hanging in the trees. Their campers made it out alive, and Sheinbaum recognized Garza and Zárate for their efforts. “They make us proud,” she said.

For the latest news on the Texas floods, read USA TODAY's coverage for Tuesday, July 8.\n\nRescue teams in central Texas scoured storm-ravaged terrain Monday looking for survivors as the death toll from last week's catastrophic flooding rose to at least 104 and bouts of heavy rain battered hard-hit areas.\n\nThe Kerr County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Monday that the county’s fatality count is now 84, including 56 adults and 28 children. Identification is pending for 22 adults and 10 children.\n\nThe area hardest hit by the floods was Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River was rapidly overwhelmed by heavy rain on July 4. The river rose to more than 20 feet in a matter of hours at several locations as it rushed downstream toward Kerrville, a city of 24,000.\n\nAmong the dead were at least 27 children and counselors from Camp Mystic, a beloved all-girls summer camp in Kerr County, where the worst of the flooding broke out. At least 10 girls and one counselor remain missing, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at a news conference Monday.\n\n\"Texas is grieving right now. The pain, the shock of what has transpired these last few days has broken the heart of our state,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cruz said he was heartbroken by the loss of children at Camp Mystic, describing it as \"every parent’s nightmare.\"\n\nThere were about 700 children at the camp when relentless rain caused the nearby Guadalupe River to surge over 26 feet in less than an hour on Friday, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said. Photos taken at the scene show a building, where some of the children slept, with broken windows and a blown-out wall. Among the mud-covered debris were pink blankets and stuffed animals.\n\nAs rescuers resumed searches for missing people by air, land, and water, officials warned those in Central Texas that there remains a danger of \"life-threatening flooding.\" Multiple flash flood warnings were active across the Hill Country as storms drenched the region, inundating roads and waterways.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Potent, slow-moving storms over central Texas have begun to trigger flooding in areas already hard-hit by the state. Forecasters with the National Weather Service have issued flash flood warnings and said that several more inches were expected to fall through the rest of the day. Drier weather is forecasted for the middle to end of the week.\n\n∎ Authorities have rescued over 850 people since the devastating flooding began last week, Cruz said at a news conference.\n\n∎ President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday that he plans to visit Texas later this week. Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, unlocking federal funding for first responders and offering FEMA assistance to victims of the flash floods.\n\nOfficials urge public to not use private drones amid search efforts\n\nKerr County officials and the Williamson County Sheriff's Office urged the public on Monday not to fly personal drones and keep them grounded as search and rescue operations continue.\n\n\"As a reminder, please do not fly personal drones,\" the Williamson County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. \"They interfere with Public Safety operations and put lives at risk. Leave the skies clear for emergency responders.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, Kerr County officials reported that a private drone was illegally operating in restricted airspace and collided with a helicopter involved in emergency operations. The helicopter made an emergency landing, according to the county.\n\nNo injuries were reported, but the county said a \"critical piece of response equipment\" was now out of service until further notice.\n\n\"This was entirely preventable. Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) are not suggestions. They are federal airspace rules designed to protect lives during emergency situations,\" the county said in a statement. \"When you fly a drone in restricted areas, you’re not just breaking the law -- you’re putting first responders, emergency crews, and the public at serious risk.\"\n\nAt least 62 people rescued in Burnet County\n\nDuring a news conference on Monday, Burnet County Sheriff Calvin Boyd said at least 62 people were rescued in the county, including some who were stranded in attics and trees, and on top of vehicles and roofs.\n\nFour deaths have been confirmed in the county, and authorities were still searching for two missing people, the sheriff said.\n\nBoyd noted the difficulties of the searches due to the county's location in Texas Hill Country. The region is known for its rugged, rolling terrain, in which heavy rains collect quickly in shallow streams and rivers.\n\n\"With all the debris that the flood brought downstream, we're having to helicopter a lot of (rescue workers) in,\" Boyd said at the news conference. \"With the humidity and the heat, it doesn't take long for these folks to get wore out. So we're having to shuffle people in every couple of hours down there.\"\n\nFlood watch expires, advisories continue along river areas\n\nA flood watch for Hill Country and the Interstate 35 corridor expired at 7 p.m. CT, according to the National Weather Service. The agency extended riverside flood watches and warnings, with some advisories lasting through Thursday.\n\nSome isolated activity was expected late Monday and overnight east of the I-35 corridor, according to the weather service. More locally heavy rainfall is also possible on Tuesday, but mainly east of the I-35 corridor where run-off impacts were not as severe.\n\n\"While the atmosphere will likely not be as supportive of the very high rain rates seen over the past few days, remain vigilant as these coastal showers could push over highly saturated ground,\" the weather service office in Austin and San Antonio said in a forecast discussion.\n\nDespite the forecast of less rain, AccuWeather warned that dangerous conditions remain a concern into Monday night.\n\n\"There is a concern we have into Wednesday; there are additional flare-ups or clusters of thunderstorms in parts of central and eastern Texas,\" according to AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno.\n\nOver 20 Texas agencies responding to flooding\n\nMore than 20 state agencies are currently responding to flooding threats across Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement on Monday. The state has also deployed over 1,750 personnel and more than 975 vehicles and equipment assets, including rescue boat teams and Blackhawk helicopters.\n\nAbbott urged residents to monitor local forecast information due to the ongoing risk of flooding for large portions of the state, such as Central Texas, the Hill Country, Big Country, and the Concho Valley.\n\n\"Texans are urged to remain weather aware, heed the guidance of local officials, and regularly monitor weather forecasts,\" Abbott said. \"Texas will remain engaged until every missing person is found and every Texan recovers from this disaster.\"\n\nLost pets could also signal the depth of destruction\n\nNon-profit pet shelter Austin Pets Alive! has taken in over 230 animals, primarily from shelters impacted by the floods.

I think the numbers are going to be much higher than we realize,\" O'Gan said. \"Maybe 80%, 90% of the animals that are reported to us are lost, their owners are also lost or deceased.\"\n\nShe added that animal organizations working in the Hill Country will need help long after the waters recede.\n\n\"We're going to be working on this for the next months after the news moves on,\" she added. \"Hopefully, they'll keep us in their thoughts and keep sending those donations because they are going to be needed for the foreseeable future.\" Read more here.\n\n— James Powel\n\nMexico, several states send crews to assist in search operations\n\nVolunteer firefighters from the Mexican border town of Acuña are helping search and rescue crews in the Kerrville area. Search-and-rescue operations continue around the clock, as hundreds of emergency personnel on the ground contend with debris, mud, and other challenges.\n\nThe team of firefighters is working in conjunction with the nonprofit organization Foundation 911 to assist in search efforts in Kerrville, according to a protective services government agency in Acuña. The crews arrived in the area early Sunday.\n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said on Monday that he is sending a 45-member search and rescue team to help crews in Central Texas for up to 14 days. The team includes two canine teams as well as boats and vehicles.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis also said that his state will deploy three swift water rescue teams through an Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) to assist with response and recovery. And Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry sent 14 state swift water rescue personnel to help with efforts.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he was deploying search-and-rescue teams to Texas to help with response efforts. The teams are highly experienced in major disaster rescue operations, including the 9/11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, according to the governor.\n\nTexas county where campers died denied money to boost warning systems\n\nNearly a decade before catastrophic flooding in Texas, the state’s Division of Emergency Management denied requests from the county where the summer camp is held for a $1 million grant to improve its flood warning system.\n\nSummer camps were top of mind during county leaders’ discussions of the project, meeting minutes show. Then-County Commissioner Tom Moser envisioned designating point people at each camp who would monitor a website and alert camp counselors and attendees if evacuation was needed.\n\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management denied Kerr County’s 2017 application, according to meeting minutes. Kerr County applied again in 2018 when more federal funding became available after Hurricane Harvey.\n\nBut meeting minutes indicate that Texas' emergency authority again did not approve it.

Camp Mystic was right on the edge of a Special Flood Hazard Area, as designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Porter noted.\n\nBut even knowing the risks may not be enough to protect American homeowners.\n\nIn Kerr County, where Camp Mystic is located, only 2,650 properties fall in FEMA’s hazard area, meaning they are required to have flood insurance. Homeowners’ insurance doesn’t cover damage from flooding. First Street’s own models find 4,592 properties with what it calls “100-year risk” in the county – nearly double the number FEMA counts.\n\nBut there are no checks on whether homeowners do carry flood insurance, and experts like Porter say only about 50% of all potentially affected homeowners do buy it. First Street's models differ from FEMA's in that they incorporate the effects of extreme precipitation, which FEMA does not account for. First Street also uses climate-change models to extrapolate changing risk into the future.\n\n– Andrea Riquier\n\nGuadalupe River sets record high crest at Hunt\n\nThe Guadalupe River set a record high crest of 37.52 feet at Hunt, Texas, on July 4, the U.S. Geological Survey said. This broke the previous record of 36.60 feet, set on July 2, 1932. Hunt is about six miles from Camp Mystic, the site of some of the worst devastation.\n\nAccording to the USGS, flood impacts of 32 feet or higher at that gage location will lead to \"disastrous life-threatening flooding (that) puts water over the roads of lowest camps and resorts from the headwaters of the North and South Forks to below Comfort.\"\n\nFrom Hurricane Katrina to dam disasters: A look at some of the worst floods in US history.\n\nWhite House calls blaming Trump’s cuts for flood response a 'depraved lie'\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the National Weather Service’s performance during the Texas floods and lashed out at Democrats who have suggested Trump’s recent cuts to the agency prevented floods victims from getting alerts sooner.\n\n“Unfortunately, in the wake of this once-in-a-generation natural disaster, we have seen many falsehoods pushed by Democrats such as Sen. Chuck Schumer and some members of the media,” Leavitt said in a Monday briefing with reporters. “Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning.”\n\nLeavitt pointed to “timely and precise forecasts and warnings” from the weather service on July 3 and on the morning of July 4, when she said the agency gave preliminary lead times of more than three hours before flash-flooding conditions occurred.\n\n\"The National Weather Service did its job,\" Leavitt said. \"They gave out timely flash flood alerts. There were record-breaking lead times in the leadup to this catastrophe. There is ongoing flood monitoring. And these offices were staffed. In fact, one of the offices was actually overstaffed.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nSchumer wants probe of National Weather Service response in Texas\n\nThe Senate's top Democrat on Monday asked a government watchdog to investigate whether cuts at the National Weather Service affected the forecasting agency's response to catastrophic and deadly flooding in Central Texas.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, asked the Department of Commerce's acting inspector general Monday to probe whether staffing vacancies at the weather service's San Antonio office contributed to \"delays, gaps or diminished accuracy\" in forecasting the flooding. He asked the watchdog to scrutinize the office's communications with Kerr County officials.\n\nThe weather service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Schumer's letter. It defended its forecasting and emergency management before, during and after the flood, in a statement Sunday.\n\nTexas Hill Country, known as 'flash flood alley,' is prone to flooding\n\nThe catastrophic flooding in the Texas Hill Country took place in a region that's known as \"flash flood alley,\" a geographic area that also includes many of the state's major metropolitan areas, such as San Antonio, Dallas, Austin and Waco.\n\nThis region is among the nation's most prone to flash flooding, known for its propensity for fast and furious flooding when extreme rain falls, Alan Gerard, CEO of weather consulting company Balanced Weather said. As bountiful, moist air from the Gulf moves over the steep hills, it can dump heavy rain.\n\nExperts said the devastating flash flooding was not a surprise, based on historical and prehistorical data.\n\n\"The flooding was certainly extreme but it should not have been historically unexpected,\" said Roger Pielke, Jr., a political scientist who has written about disaster preparedness and climate change. \"The documented record of extreme flooding in 'flash flood alley' goes back several centuries.\" Read more here.\n\nWhat we know about Texas flood victims\n\nA director of a Texas summer camp for girls who was known as the \"heart and soul\" of the program.

He said reviews of the timeline will focus on whether there are tools that would enable earlier detection of major floods – a challenge when floodwaters rise as quickly as they did on Friday.\n\n\"If we can go back and do it again, we would evacuate particularly those in the most vulnerable areas – the young children in the cabins closest to the water ... the people in RVs,\" Cruz said.\n\n“Next time there is a flood, I hope we have in place processes to remove especially the most vulnerable from harm’s way,” he said. “But that will be a process that will take careful examination of what happened.”\n\nHow many people have died in the Texas floods?\n\nBelow are the latest numbers of reported fatalities from state and local officials across central Texas.\n\nKerr County: 84 deaths\n\nTravis County: 7 deaths\n\nKendall County: 6 deaths\n\nBurnet County: 4 deaths\n\nWilliamson County: 2 deaths\n\nTom Green County: 1 death\n\nFlooding ongoing as storms ramp up in central Texas\n\nAcross the rain-soaked Texas Hill Country, thunderstorms have triggered additional flooding, inundating roadways and trapping motorists in their vehicles, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings, which indicate that flooding is either ongoing or imminent, across multiple central Texas counties, including Burnet, Bell, Coryell, and Lampasas. Federal forecasters say 2 to 5 inches of rain has fallen and several more inches are expected.\n\n\"Multiple roads are becoming impassable due to flood waters, and there have been several reports of vehicles stranded on flooded roadways,\" the weather service said in a flood warning set to expire at 10:15 a.m. local time. \"Flash flooding is already occurring.\"\n\nRapid DNA being used to identify Texas flood victims\n\nWhile rescue crews are searching for missing people, authorities are also scrambling to identify the bodies of victims recovered in the aftermath of the Independence Day floods.\n\nIn a statement Sunday evening, the Kerr County Sheriff’s Office said 18 adults and 10 children are at a funeral home and still need to be identified.\n\nTexas Rangers are collecting DNA from family members and deceased victims and flying them to the University of North Texas near Dallas for analysis, said Col. Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\n“We will have answers with rapid DNA in hours – not days – to get some closure and information back to these families,” Martin said.\n\nA scream that saved lives as floodwaters barreled across Texas\n\nWhen Matthew Crowder got to work at Texas Paintball around 4 a.m. on July 5, the floodwaters had already begun to rise. He noticed the water was encircling a nearby home, so he called 911 and later began to scream.\n\nInside, Chrissy Eliashar was awoken by her son and quickly sprang into action, gathering her three children, a family friend and her four dogs and headed for the porch. There, she watched helplessly as her car floated away. They tried to go through the backyard, but it had \"already become a lake.\"\n\nCrowder, who was clinging to a nearby chain-link fence, yelled for the family to make their way to him. The family waded into the knee-deep water and Eliashar's young daughter fell and lost her shoe. They managed to reach a nearby pickup truck, where Crowder pulled them to safety.\n\n\"I'm so grateful that he screamed and was able to wake us up and be that guide to safety for us,\" Eliashar told USA TODAY. \"He really saved us.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nHow much rain fell during Texas floods\n\nHow to donate to Texas flood victims\n\nIn the wake of the deadly Texas floods, a variety of aid groups, nonprofits and other organizations are accepting donations to help victims and assist in the recovery effort.\n\nThe Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country started a Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, which will provide aid to vetted organizations in Hunt, Ingram, Kerrville, Center Point, and other areas.

Got more questions? Fill out this form and check back for updates as we take on more of your questions.\n\nWhy was there no warning?\n\nThe extreme flooding began around 4:00 a.m. on July 4, as storms dumped more than 10 inches of rain over the Texas Hill Country.\n\nState emergency management officials warned as early as July 2 that west and central Texas faced heavy rains and flash flood threats, citing National Weather Service forecasts ahead of the holiday weekend.\n\nMeteorologists on July 3 predicted a “slight” risk – or level 2 out of 4 – for flash flooding. But there were no predictions of catastrophic floods. That same day, the National Weather Service released a “flood watch” for eight Hill Country counties, including Kerr. The advisory predicted 1 to 3 inches of rain and up to 7 inches in some places.\n\nThe weather service's Austin office put out a “flash flood emergency” bulletin at 4:03 a.m. on Friday, when many were still asleep.\n\n“This is a FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY for South-central Kerr County, including Hunt,” the bulletin said. “This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!”\n\nWhat’s the death toll now?\n\nAs of Sunday evening, state and local authorities said at least 81 people have died in the flooding. As of Sunday afternoon, Sheriff Larry Leitha of Kerr County, where the worst of the flooding occurred, said authorities had recovered the bodies of 40 adults and 28 children.\n\nWhat is being done to save people in the area?\n\nSearch and rescue efforts are underway for people who are still missing.\n\nCrews have been working around the clock to find the missing, traversing swollen waterways and scouring riverbanks littered with mangled trees and rubble. As of Sunday, about 650 people have been rescued, officials said.\n\nHow bad was the flooding and is the weather expected to get worse?\n\nThe gauge on the Guadalupe River near Kerrville surged from less than two feet to more than 34 feet in just over an hour on July 4.\n\nOn Sunday, forecasters expected several more inches of rain and warned of additional flooding and a worsening of conditions on the ground.\n\nIs there flooding in the San Antonio area? Was Brady, Texas affected by the flood? What Texas cities were flooded?\n\nSeveral cities in the Central Texas region between San Antonio and Austin were hit by the unrelenting rain over the weekend.\n\nPortions of at least four cities in the region took on more than 10 inches of rain during the Independence Day weekend: Liberty Hill, 20.6; Lakeway, 13.5; Kerrville, 11.9; and Leander 10.5.\n\nWhat are some things I can do to help?\n\nThe Red Cross, World Central Kitchen, Kerr County Relief Fund, are taking donations on their websites.\n\nCrowdfunding website GoFundMe has a page for verified fundraisers connected to the flooding in Central Texas.

A beloved teacher from the Houston metropolitan area.\n\nDestructive flooding triggered by unrelenting rain that rapidly overwhelmed the Guadalupe River has killed at least 100 people across central Texas. State and local officials said search and rescue efforts were still underway, including for 10 children and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp at the edge of the Guadalupe River. At least 27 children and counselors from the all-girls summer camp, which has long had ties to top Texas political figures, have died.\n\nThe river surged over 26 feet in less than an hour on July 4, carrying away cars, RVs and structures. It blew out the wall of one camp building where children slept, leaving debris-covered mud amid pink blankets and stuffed animals.\n\nFlooding-related deaths have been reported in six counties. The victims include summer camp directors, teachers, grandparents, parents, and children.\n\nHere are the stories of those who lost their lives:\n\nJane Ragsdale\n\nJane Ragsdale was the \"heart and soul\" of Heart O’ the Hills, a summer camp for girls in Kerr County, according to the program's website.\n\nShe was a camper and a counselor there before becoming a co-owner of the camp in 1976. Ragsdale later served as the camp's program director from 1978 to 1987, and went on to become the camp director in 1988, the website added.\n\nIn a statement, the camp said it was \"right in the path of the flood\" and its facilities sustained serious damage. They noted that since the camp was between sessions when the flooding occurred, no children had been staying there.\n\n\"However, our Director and the camp’s longtime co-owner, Jane Ragsdale, lost her life. We at the camp are stunned and deeply saddened by Jane’s death,\" the camp said in the statement. \"She embodied the spirit of Heart O’ the Hills and was exactly the type of strong, joyful woman that the camp aimed to develop with the girls entrusted to us each summer.\"\n\nThe camp also paid tribute to Ragsdale in a Facebook post, saying she was \"the heart of The Heart.\"\n\n\"Jane wasn’t just our director, she was our guiding light, our example, and our safe place. She had the rare gift of making every person feel seen, loved, and important. Her kindness, strength, and wisdom shaped generations of campers and staff,\" the post states.\n\n\"Her legacy lives in every laugh heard on the hill, every tradition passed down, every song we sing, every manner she taught us and every life she touched, which is too many to count,\" the post continued.\n\n− Thao Nguyen\n\nBlair and Brooke Harber\n\nTwo young sisters, Blair and Brooke Harber, were staying in Hill Country over the Fourth of July holiday when their \"lives were tragically cut short\" by flooding along the Guadalupe River, according to St. Rita Catholic School.\n\nThe school said in a statement on Facebook that Blair was a rising eighth grader, while Brooke was entering the sixth grade.\n\nThe school described Blair as an \"outstanding student\" who was enrolled in advanced classes and actively involved in school activities. She played several sports, cheered for the school's cheerleading team, served as a student ambassador, and was part of the yearbook team and speech and drama program.\n\nBrooke was an \"excellent student who brought joy and energy wherever she went,\" according to the school. She also played several sports, and loved speech and drama, in which she had a gift for improv, the school noted.\n\n\"Blair had the kindest heart and loved to serve others,\" the school said. \"Brooke never met a stranger and loved everyone she met.\"\n\nThe two girls had been with their grandparents, who remain missing, when the flooding occurred. The girls' parents were in a separate cabin and were safe, according to the school.\n\n\"Blair and Brooke were young women of deep faith, and religion was one of their favorite subjects. On the night they died, they went to the loft of their cabin with their rosaries,\" the school said. \"When Blair and Brooke were found the next day, fifteen miles downriver, they were together. Even in their last moments, they held tightly to each other, a powerful symbol of their lasting bond and their trust in God.\"\n\n− Thao Nguyen\n\nJeff Wilson\n\nJeff Wilson died in the flood, according to a social media post from the Humble Independent School District.\n\n\"Tonight our #HumbleISDFamily is grieving the devastating loss of @HumbleISD_KPHS teacher Jeff Wilson, who passed away due to the catastrophic flooding in Kerrville,\" the school district said, which is located in the city of Humble in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\nWilson had been a teacher in the school district for 30 years. He worked at both Humble High School and Kingwood Park High School.\n\n\"He was a beloved teacher and co-worker to many and will be deeply missed,\" according to the school district. \"Jeff's brother-in-law has shared that at this time, Jeff's wife Amber and son Shiloh are still considered missing.

Family and friends of Eastland described him as a father figure for generations of girls who attended the summer camp, according to the Chronicle.\n\nIn an Instagram tribute, his grandson said Eastland was more than his grandfather. He said Eastland was his \"dear friend, fishing buddy, hunting guide, golf partner, avid Texas Longhorns fanatic, my #1 fan, and above all else: a hero.\"\n\n\"If he wasn’t going to die of natural causes, this was the only other way, saving the girls that he so loved and cared for,\" George Eastland wrote in the post. \"That’s the man my grandfather was.

His family is \"living the nightmare of nightmares,” according to his friend and former Miami Herald colleague, Marty Merzer.\n\nThe girls, both 8 years old, were at Camp Mystic with their older sister Harper, 14, who survived, the Tallahassee Democrat, part of the USA TODAY Network reported.\n\nJohn and Lacy Lawrence, the twins' parents, as well as David Lawrence and his wife, have decided not to speak with the media while navigating the difficult loss, but they provided a message for Merzer to share on their behalf.\n\n\"Hanna and Rebecca brought so much joy to us, to their big sister Harper, and to so many others. We will find ways to keep that joy, and to continue to spread it for them. But we are devastated that the bond we shared with them, and that they shared with each other, is now frozen in time,\" the family said.\n\nThe twins, who were rising third graders at University Park Elementary School in suburban Dallas, Texas, loved to read, according to the family. The two girls had vivid imaginations playing together, swapping lead roles for each story they created.\n\nTheir bond went beyond sisterhood or even their twin connection; the girls were friends but also had unique identities, the family said.\n\n— Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; Alaijah Brown, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nBobby and Amanda Martin\n\nBobby and Amanda Martin were vacationing with other family members in an RV campground near Ingram, Texas along the Guadalupe River when the floodwaters hit.\n\nJohn Martin, Bobby Martin’s father, told USA TODAY that authorities had identified the bodies of the Odessa, Texas couple following the devastating floods on July 4.\n\nBobby, 46, and Amanda, 44, had gone to high school together, he said. Each had children from a previous relationship before they had found a new chapter together.\n\n“They always were adventurous. They always went hiking, climbing, kayaking and camping,” he said. “They’re in a better place now.”\n\nFour months ago, Bobby Martin had started a new job at a West Texas company that provided anchors and bolts to the oil & gas industry, according to his Linkedin page.\n\n“This is a huge loss not only for their family but for everyone who knew these two truly amazing people,” according to the GoFundMe for the family.\n\nBobby Martin’s son − Odessa police officer Bailey Martin, 23 – was also with them and was later found dead.\n\n-Chris Kenning\n\nLila Bonner and Eloise Peck\n\nLila Bonner and Eloise Peck were “best friends” who died together, Peck’s mother, Missy Peck, told KDFW FOX 4 in Dallas.\n\nShe described her daughter as being “friends with everyone” and said she “loved spaghetti, but not more than she loved dogs and animals.”\n\n“Eloise had a family who loved her fiercely for the eight years she was with us. Especially her mommy,” Peck said.\n\nShe is “now an angel,” the family said in a separate statement given to KXAS NBC 5 in Dallas.\n\nBonner’s family also told the outlet they are suffering “unimaginable grief” and “ache with all who loved her.”\n\nThe family said it could not confirm further details about Bonner’s death and asked for privacy amid their grief.\n\nBoth girls attended Bradfield Elementary School in the Highland Park Independent School District, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nA district statement described the flooding as an “unimaginable tragedy,” that killed “multiple” students. It offered counseling services to students and staff in the wake of the event.\n\nPeople across the state tied green ribbons around trees over the weekend in the girls’ memory. Highland Park High School’s parent-teacher association also said its members would be tying the ribbons around their homes and campuses across the district.\n\n“Together, our Scots will show our support of our district’s young students who we love greatly,” its Facebook post read.\n\n− BrieAnna J. Frank\n\nChloe Childress\n\nChloe Childress, 19, was spending the summer as a counselor at Camp Mystic along the Guadalupe River – mentoring children who she also worked to save from floodwaters.\n\nChildress was among dozens killed when sudden river flooding swept through the Christian camp on July 4, according to a statement from her Houston-based family.\n\n“Our family was shocked to hear of the horrific tragic flooding in the hill country, and we were devastated to learn that our precious Chloe was among the victims. While we know that her joy is now eternal and her faith has become sight, our hearts are shattered by this loss and the similar heartbreak of other families like ours,” the family said.\n\nShe graduated from The Kinkaid School in Houston earlier this year, where an administrator recalled her “steady compassion that settled a room,” ABC reported. She planned to attend the University of Texas at Austin in the fall.\n\nShe died after working to save younger campers during the floods, according to the New York Post.\n\n“She lost her life upholding this selfless and fierce commitment to others,” Jonathan Eades, the head of the Kinkaid School, said in a statement.\n\nChildress “lived a beautiful life that saturated those around her with contagious joy, unending grace and abiding faith,” her family said.\n\n-Chris Kenning\n\nReece and Paula Zunker\n\nA cherished Kerrville high school soccer coach and his wife were among the victims of Friday’s flash flooding, the Kerrville Independent School District confirmed.\n\n“It is with profound sadness that we share the heartbreaking news of the passing of one of our beloved teachers, Reece Zunker, and his wife, Paula,” the district said on its Facebook page.\n\nThe couple’s two children, Lyle and Holland, remain missing, the district said.\n\nZunker was a dedicated father figure who cared about his players and students, staying in touch with them even after graduation and showing up for team dinners originally designed to give him a night off, said Jayne Zirkel, whose sons Jasen, now 25, and Jake, a 17-year-old senior, both played soccer for him.\n\n“He was fierce on the field, and he stood up for his boys,” said Zirkel, who works with the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country. “If there was a call he didn’t agree with, he let the officials know. And he did it in a respectful way. But his players knew that he had their back, and he knew that they had his.”\n\nZunker joined Tivy High School in 2012 and led the 2018-19 boys’ soccer program to a 22-3-1 record and perhaps the school’s most successful playoff run, Zirkel said. But more than that, whether on the field or in his classroom, he instilled in his players a sense of belonging and support.\n\n“In some cases he was probably the only positive male role model that they saw, because he spent so much time with them,” Zirkel said. “If you play only soccer here in Kerrville, you were with him year-round.”\n\nOn its Facebook page, the Tivy High School boys’ soccer program mourned the loss of an inspiring leader whose mantra was “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” the motto of his favorite soccer team, Liverpool F.C.\n\n“Coach Reece Zunker was not just a soccer coach,” it said. “He was a mentor, teacher and a role model for our Kerrville kids. He rebuilt the soccer program and left a legacy. His passion for his players, students, co-workers, community and his family will never be forgotten.”\n\nThe district praised Reece Zunker as a committed and passionate instructor whose “unwavering dedication to our students, athletes and the Tivy community touched countless lives and will never be forgotten” and commended Paula Zunker, a former Tivy teacher, for her enduring impact on students.\n\n“Together, we will navigate this grief one day at a time,” the district said.\n\nZirkel said Reece Zunker also led and advocated for Tivy’s construction trades program, overseeing projects in which students built tiny houses, with the eventual sale funding the next construction project.\n\n“He was very forward thinking,” she said. “He wanted to make sure the program thrived.”\n\nShe described Zunker’s wife Paula as “a really sweet person.”\n\n“She was always there to support Reece,” Zirkel said. “She was a great mom. Those kids were amazing and they were a very wonderful family.”\n\n-Marc Ramirez\n\nTanya Burwick\n\nThe Fourth of July season had always been a big deal for the Burwick family.\n\nFor years, Tanya Burwick, 62, and her husband, Robert Glenn, ran the Burwick Fireworks Stand in Blackwell, Texas, said daughter Lindsey Brown Burwick. In recent years, as the couple of 42 years grew older, they started handing the reins to Lindsey and her brother Zac.\n\nIt was on the Fourth when Tanya set out on her normal 40 minute commute to her employer, Walmart, in nearby San Angelo.\n\nShe never made it.\n\nInstead, Lindsey said her mother called her father early in the morning, saying she was in “the midst of running into flooded waters.” He tried to calm her while setting out to find her. But it was too late. Authorities had already closed the roads and she had stopped answering her phone.\n\nAs the search continued, Lindsey said and her brother questioned if they should keep the stand open or not. The community of Blackwell, though, took that burden from them and ran the stand for them. She said family members and close friends also helped in the search when they couldn’t immediately get to San Angelo because of road closures.\n\n“We just felt comforted in our time of grief,” she said.\n\nShe added that she and her family were grateful to the San Angelo police department and their efforts to find her mother\n\nThe younger Burwick said her mom enjoyed spending time with her dad in the pasture tending to their cows and horse, playing word games or watching Reels on her phone during her free time. She was down to earth and raw just like her mother, said Lindsey. The family also received an outpouring of support from people who knew her at Walmart and remarked on her kindness.\n\nIn a Facebook post from the Walmart where she worked, customers left comments describing Burwick as “sweet.”\n\n“Her dedication, warmth, and spirit touched so many of us over the years,” the post by the Walmart store read. “She will be truly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing and working with her.”\n\n-Chris Quintana\n\nKatheryn Eads\n\nKatheryn Eads, 52, spent “a fulfilling life, cut far too short” helping young people ranging from foster kids to college students, her daughter told USA TODAY.\n\n“Trying to figure out our lives without her is a possibility we never planned to face and we will always miss her,” Victoria Eads wrote in a text message.\n\nEads died in the Texas floods while camping with husband, Brian Eads, according to a fundraiser for the family.\n\nShe had worked at the University of Texas at San Antonio since 2022 and recently became a full-time faculty member in the Department of Psychology in the College for Health, Community and Policy, according to a university news release.\n\n“Through her insight, expertise and unwavering commitment to student success, she inspired generations of learners and colleagues alike,” said Heather Shipley, the provost. “Her absence leaves a profound void at UTSA, but her impact will continue to resonate through the lives she touched.”\n\nEads told USA TODAY her father had been caught in the flooding and that he was doing “physically doing alright - a few stitches, badly bruised, but he’s alive and I’m very thankful for that.”\n\nIn addition to her husband, Eads is survived by her children and grandchildren.\n\nVictoria Eads said she knew it wouldn’t ease the grief of parents whose lost children in the flooding, but that she hoped they knew, “there’s a momma up there helping them and giving them hugs until their parents get back to them.”\n\n-Chris Quintana\n\nJulian Ryan\n\nJulian Ryan died out of love for his family.\n\nThe 27-year-old punched a window to get his fiancé, Christina Wilson, children and mother onto the roof of their Ingram, Texas, home that was quickly flooding on July 4, Wilson told KHOU 11 in Houston.\n\nThe move “almost cut it (his arm) clean off” and Ryan had lost “all his blood” by 6 a.m., Wilson said.\n\n“He looked at me and the kids and my mother-in-law and (said), ‘I’m sorry, I’m not going to make it. I love y’all,’” she said.\n\nThat made him “the hero in this story,” Connie Salas, Ryan’s sister, told the outlet. Kris Roberts said his late best friend was the “kindest person I’ve ever met in my life.”\n\nA GoFundMe for Ryan’s family had raised nearly $100,000 as of July 7. It further described Ryan as having an “infectious laugh and unwavering kindness.”\n\n“He touched countless lives with his humor and will be deeply missed by everyone who had the privilege of knowing him,” it said.\n\n− BrieAnna J. Frank\n\nJohn Burgess IV and Julia Anderson Burgess\n\nParents of three are among those who died in the Texas flooding over the Fourth of July weekend, according to a family member’s post on X.\n\nJohn Burgess IV and Julia Anderson Burgess had been camping near the Guadalupe River with their sons on July 4th when they went missing.\n\nMichael Schwab, a former video editor with The Tennessean in Nashville and the USA TODAY Network, is cousin to Julia, and he has written on X that both parents have been found dead. He told USA TODAY the family is requesting privacy.\n\nIn his post, Schwab stated that the two boys, 5 and 1, remain missing. Their daughter, according to Schwab, had been at another camp but had made it home safely.\n\n−Chris Quintana\n\nJanie Hunt\n\nJanie Hunt, a 9-year-old who was a relative of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, was killed in the flood while attending Camp Mystic.\n\nJanie’s mother and grandmother both confirmed the deaths to various news outlets. Clark's wife, Tavia Hunt, addressed it in an Instagram post.\n\n“Our hearts are broken by the devastation from the floods in Wimberley and the tragic loss of so many lives – including a precious little Hunt cousin, along with several friend’s little girls,” she said.\n\nIt was her first time at Camp Mystic and she was joined by six of her cousins who survived, her grandmother, Margaret Hunt, told the New York Times.\n\n-Chris Kenning\n\nJoyce Catherine Badon\n\nJoyce Badon, 21, was staying at a cabin in Hunt, Texas for a weekend with friends when the flooding hit.\n\n“A flash flood came through and washed their cars away. It happened so quickly with so much water, they could not get in the attic,” her mother, Kellye Badon, said on Facebook.\n\nKellye and her father, Ty Badon, rushed to the area to find her. Ty Badon later confirmed to NBC News that she had been recovered and identified.\n\nJoyce’s Facebook page said she went to a Catholic high school in Beaumont, Texas and studied at the Savannah College Of Art And Design.\n\n“God showed us the way” to find her, her mother posted on social media.\n\nShe later displayed a photo of rainbow that read, “Joyce Catherine telling us from heaven ‘all is well with my soul.’”\n\n- Chris Kenning\n\nAnna Margaret Bellows\n\nAnna Margaret Bellows, 8, was a “radiant joy.”\n\nThat’s how her mother, Patricia Bellows, described her to a Houston TV station, adding that she was fun and kind. Bellows had gone to the same camp as a child.\n\nHer daughter had been staying in the camp’s Bubble Inn cabin, where some still remained missing.\n\nCamp Mystic director Dick Eastland died in the raging floodwaters trying to evacuate children from her cabin. Family members confirmed to the Houston Chronicle that Anna had died.\n\n\"I have unending gratitude for these brave camp counselors who safely evacuated so many campers. And to the two camp counselors who gave their lives trying to protect my baby, and to Dick Eastland, who died protecting my baby,\" Bellows told ABC13-TV.\n\n-Chris Kenning\n\nRenee Smajstrla\n\nRenee Smajstrla was thrilled to be at Camp Mystic with her friends, according to a Facebook post from her uncle, Shawn Salta. She was 8, and had just finished second grade with straight A's at Hunt Elementary, according to her obituary.\n\nSalta shared a photo taken on July 3 in which Smajstrla flashes a toothy grin at the camera while seated next to someone just out of frame. In it, she holds a piece of paper with a pink bag slung across her shoulder.\n\nSalta explained in his July 4 post that Smajstrla had been missing earlier, but had “been found and while not the outcome we prayed for, the social media outreach likely assisted the first responders in helping to identify her so quickly.” An NBC affiliate in the Dallas area also reported it had spoken to Smajstrla’s mother who said her daughter died in the flooding.\n\nSalta wrote the family was grateful that she was, “with her friends and having the time of her life, as evidenced by this picture from yesterday.”\n\n“She will forever be living her best life at Camp Mystic,” he wrote.\n\nCalvin and Catherine Smajstrla, Renne’s parents, have since launched a fund named after her dedicated, “to helping children across Texas attend faith-based camps and retreat programs that nurture their hearts, minds, and faith,” Salta wrote in a message.\n\n“Renee’s light continues to shine through the lives of the children who, because of this fund, will have the chance to experience the same life-changing moments she cherished,” Salta wrote.\n\n−Chris Quintana\n\nMary Grace Baker\n\nShe was a “bright light in our close-knit family,” St. Anne Catholic Church said of Mary Grace Baker, 8, who perished in the floods while attending Camp Mystic.\n\nThe church said in a social media post that the Beaumont, Texas family had received confirmation of her death and had asked for privacy.\n\n“We are heartbroken at the loss of our Mary Grace. Words are difficult to find, but we take comfort that her earthly body has been found, and her pure soul is now wrapped in the arms of Jesus,” St. Anne said.\n\nShe loved art, dance, attending grade school at the parish school and playing little league. She’d recently celebrated her first communion and finished second grade.\n\n“She was a girls’ girl who loved pink, sparkles and bows in her signature angelic ringlet curls,” the church said. “Her giggle was contagious, as was her spirit.”\n\nShe had been missing in the aftermath of the torrent of floodwaters that slammed into the camp set on the Guadalupe River.\n\nFather Andrew Moore of St. Anne shared her mother's social media post.\n\n“We have felt all of your prayers and support the past couple of days. Please continue to lift us up, as we do not see how we can possibly carry on without her,” Katie Baker said.\n\n-Chris Kenning\n\nBailey Martin\n\nBailey Martin, a 23-year-old police officer in his hometown of Odessa, Texas, was among those who died in the flooding, the Odessa Police Department announced Tuesday.\n\n“We are deeply saddened to share with our community that Odessa Police Officer Bailey Martin has been found and, tragically, is deceased,” the department posted on Facebook.\n\nMartin was among several family members who had made the trip to the Guadalupe River near Kerrville to celebrate the 4th of July holiday. His father and stepmother also perished, and Martin’s girlfriend remains missing.\n\nIn 2022, the department featured Martin in a separate post as one of that year’s police academy recruits, saying he’d envisioned a law enforcement career even at a young age, hoping to become a detective.\n\n“I wanted to join because the world we live is always changing,” Martin was quoted as saying. “I wanted to do everything I can to be part of my community as it grows, allowing me to preserve the peace and safety.”\n\nOdessa police officers are wearing mourning bands over their badges and the department flags have been lowered to half-staff. The department is also encouraging Odessa residents to replace their porch lights with blue bulbs until the weekend in Martin’s memory.\n\n“We will remember his service,” the Texas Municipal Police Association posted on social media. “We will honor his sacrifice.”\n\n-Marc Ramirez\n\nLainey Landry\n\nIt was less than two months ago that 9-year-old Lainey Landry of Houston made her first communion.\n\nA photo shared by St. George Catholic Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana − where Landry’s grandmother is a parishioner − shows Landry with a braces-filled smile, wearing a white dress and flower crown, and holding her hands in a prayer position at the May 10 ceremony.\n\nThe church asked for the public to pray for Landry’s family and offer a rosery for “the families seeking comfort, strength and healing as they grieve the loss of their children.”\n\nIt urged the devout to lean on their faith and ended its post by quoting Psalm 34:18: “The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.”\n\nLaynie Weaver, whom the Houston Chronicle identified as Landry’s cousin, said in a July 6 Facebook post that Landry “is in heaven” and asked for continued prayers for all affected by the flooding, including Landry’s “grieving family.”\n\n“The fact that she was found is somewhat of a miracle itself,” Weaver wrote. “Prayers, positive (thoughts), kind energy and love are powerful.”\n\n− BrieAnna J. Frank\n\nGreta Toranzo\n\nIt was Greta Toranzo’s third time at Camp Mystic, according to a Facebook post from her mother Ellen. Her child had been “overjoyed to be reunited with her camp friends for weeks of fun, laughter, sports, and sisterhood.”\n\nIt was also her last.\n\nHer mother wrote on July 8 that Toranzo was caught in the Fourth of July flooding and had lost her life.\n\n“Whether at home, at school, in the pool, or on the tennis court, Greta radiated joy,” her mom wrote. “She was kind, creative, and full of love and also brave, athletic, and determined.”\n\nThe family requested privacy as they grieve the “unimaginable loss of our Greta.”\n\nThe Timbergrove Sports Association, a nonprofit youth sports group in Texas that Torzano was part of, wrote on Facebook that she had “brought joy to everyone around her at TSA.”\n\nHer impact in the community was made clear earlier in the week too. A parent teacher group associated with Sinclair Elementary, Toranzo’s school, had posted photos of a vigil on July 5. Toranzo had been missing at the time. The images show throngs of people, many of them children, all gathered in hope of Toranzo’s return. Most wore blue, her favorite color.\n\n−Chris Quintana\n\nMollie Schaffer\n\nRandy Schaffer met his wife Mollie in June 1967, just weeks after they graduated from high school. They’d been together ever since.\n\nIn the end, the Houston criminal defense lawyer wrote in a moving Facebook post, they would be separated only by the raging waters of the Guadalupe River.\n\nKent Schaffer, Schaffer’s brother and also a criminal defense attorney in Houston, described his sister-in-law as “an incredibly nice person” who never had a bad thing to say about anyone and always followed through if someone asked for her help. A devotee of the theater, she was an ardent arts supporter, he said.\n\nThe Schaffer brothers are Jewish and Mollie had converted to Judaism and would cook elaborate Passover dinners.\n\n“She became more Jewish than all of us,” Kent Schaffer said. “Everything she made was pretty. She didn’t serve food in tin pans. It looked like a work of art.”\n\nStill, being a good person was Mollie’s specialty, he said, the kind of person all the kids rushed to hug at holiday gatherings.\n\n“People would say, ‘she’s a saint’ – mostly because she could put up with all of us,” he said. “Especially in a family of lawyers. We’re very contentious, passionate people.”\n\nThe weather had seemed fine, Randy Schaffer wrote in his Facebook post, when the couple turned in Thursday night at the River Inn Resort in Hunt, Texas, where they were marking their 46th year visiting the riverfront area with an ever smaller group of law school friends.\n\n“They’d meet there every summer for an extended weekend,” Kent Schaffer said. “It was always the same hotel. They’d float around the river and have barbecues. That’s the way they’d stay in touch with each other.”\n\nAt 3 a.m. Friday, the couple awoke to loud banging on their door, Randy Schaffer wrote. It was the manager, telling them they had to evacuate immediately “because the river was about to overflow the banks.”\n\n“I looked out the window and saw the river raging like Niagara Falls,” he wrote.\n\nAt the manager’s direction, he wrote, they got into Mollie’s SUV and began driving toward a nearby hill. Instead, they saw cars ahead of them turning around to rush back the other way.\n\nHis wife stopped on the shoulder of the road as the water quickly rose around the vehicle, sweeping it into the current. The car hit a tree, he wrote, then spun onto the road again.\n\n“We knew that we had to get out of the car,” he said. “However, the doors wouldn’t open.”\n\nMollie lowered the SUV’s front windows and told him to dive out feet first, he said. It was difficult; the seat was too low, the window too high. He fell back onto the seat.\n\n“You have to push harder,” Mollie told him. Those were the last words he ever heard her say, he wrote.\n\nHe pushed as hard as he could and went out the window. The current pulled him underwater toward the river, propelling him into a pole.\n\n“I wrapped my arms around the pole and climbed up until my head was above water,” he wrote. “I looked for and called to Mollie but didn’t see her or the car. She had been swept into the river.”\n\nHe held onto the pole for an hour until the water finally began to recede and his feet touched ground.\n\nHis wife’s body was recovered on July 6.\n\n“Mollie died in a manner consistent with how she lived – selflessly taking care of someone else before she took care of herself,” Randy Schaffer wrote. “She wouldn’t leave the car until she was sure that I had done so. She saved my life.”\n\n— Marc Ramirez\n\nMary Kate Jacobe\n\nMary Kate Jacobe, 8 – nicknamed “Sissy” − was the baby of the large Houston family.\n\nShe was “the light of our lives. She was tiny but mighty, full of love and joy with a smile that melted your heart,” her family said.\n\nMary Kate was attending Camp Mystic 4 when floodwaters smashed into the Christian camp set on the Guadalupe River in the early hours of July 4, killing her and dozens of other campers.\n\n“We are utterly shattered and forever changed by the loss of our girl,” the family said in a statement. “Our precious angel baby has entered the gates of Heaven.”\n\nThe Houston family said they appreciated the support and prayers they had received as families grieve lost lives of campers and counselors.\n\n“Our family extends our deepest sympathy to all those affected by the tragic flooding. We stand united by loss but rooted in love,” the Jacobe family said.\n\n-Chris Kenning\n\nSarah Sample Graves\n\nAmong those lost to the flooding was 91-year-old Sarah Sample Graves, a devoted matriarch and church member known for her hospitality and sharp wit.\n\n“We’re mourning the heartbreaking loss of our beloved grandmother,” wrote Sarah Sample, Graves’ granddaughter, on social media.\n\nGraves’ Kerrville home was destroyed by a 30-foot wave that swept her downstream, along with Sample’s father and his dog, according to the post.\n\n“Though our dad and his dog miraculously survived, we’re still reeling,” Sample wrote. “We find solace knowing our dad was with her until the very end, caring for her as he has for years.”\n\nSample described the Guadalupe River as “a treasured part of our lives” and said the family is struggling to come to terms with the flash floods that ravaged the area.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle quoted Catherine Graves, Graves’ daughter, describing her mother as “the ultimate matriarch” who exemplified faith and service.\n\nGraves was born in Longview, in East Texas, according to an obituary posted by Kerrville-area Grimes Funeral Chapels. She studied at Southern Methodist University in Dallas and then the University of Texas in Austin.\n\nShe and her husband, Ghent Graves Jr., raised two children; she would eventually have 10 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren, the obituary said, and was known as a welcoming and hospitable host.\n\n“Her unwavering dedication to family has left an indelible mark on our lives,” Sarah Sample wrote.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nMary Stevens\n\n“Fearless. Enthusiastic. Compassionate. And full of joy.”\n\nThat’s how Stacy Stevens said she will remember her 8-year-old daughter, Mary Stevens, in a statement shared with the Austin-American Statesman.\n\nThough she said the family’s world is “shattered” by her daughter’s death, she added that she finds comfort in the letters her daughter sent from camp before the flood. Mary Stevens was having a blast at camp and was even part of a dance party with her friends “before the Lord decided to take you from us.”\n\n“He has bigger plans for you,” Stacy Stevens said.\n\nMary Stevens was a student at Highland Park Elementary School in Austin and was one of the 750 girls at Camp Mystic when the flood hit, KVUE 24 in Austin reported.\n\nHundreds of people gathered for a vigil honoring Mary Stevens and other victims at Casis Elementary School in Austin on July 7.\n\n− BrieAnna J.

I’m always all in.”\n\nThe teen was among those killed in the Texas floods on July 4, his father, Jermaine Jarmon, confirmed to several media outlets.\n\nAlso killed was Jermaine Jarmon’s partner, Alissa Martin, 54.\n\nThey were swept away by flooding near Sandy Creek around Leander, located north of Austin, Kylee Louderman, a relative, posted on social media.\n\nThe area band community posted a tribute on Facebook:\n\n“We are absolutely heartbroken by the tragic loss of Braxton Jarmon, an incoming sophomore and a cherished member of The Glenn Grizzly Band,” it said. “Braxton lost his life during the disastrous flooding this past weekend.

Her husband, James, shared the same post hours later. Just a day later on July 3, Cindy posted a picture of James and her in a vehicle.\n\n“Road trip!!” she wrote. “Heading to the Guadalupe River and the Hill Country for some much needed downtime.”\n\nCindy and James did make it camping, according to Facebook posts from their children, but they would be caught in the Texas flooding on the Fourth of July weekend. Neither Cindy or James survived according to a GoFundMe and posts from family members on social media.\n\n“This morning, our worst fears were confirmed — my parents were found and identified, but tragically, they did not survive,” wrote Tamra Blasius. “Our hearts are broken, and our family is devastated by the loss of both of our parents.”\n\nBlasius declined to comment and requested privacy for her family.\n\nThe Oxford Eagle, a newspaper in Oxford, Mississippi, reported that Cindy Rushing grew up in the town and attended Oxford High School. On Facebook, she liked to post about her children’s accomplishments, her tomato plants and passages from the Bible.

For the latest news read our story for Sunday, July 6.\n\nA day after flooding rains rapidly overwhelmed the Guadalupe River and sent deadly floodwaters through a swath of central Texas, authorities said hundreds of people had been saved from the danger but many remained missing – and the death toll continued to rise.\n\n“The rescue has gone as well as can be expected. It’s getting time now for the recovery, and that's going to be a long, toilsome task for us,” Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said.\n\nAt least 52 people were killed. Forty-three of the deaths ‒ 28 adults and 15 children ‒ were in Kerr County, Sheriff Larry Leitha said. The count was up from 18 adults and nine children earlier in the day Saturday.\n\nThe other nine deaths were spread throughout other counties.\n\nTanya Burwick, 62, was found dead in San Angelo, in Tom Green County several blocks from her SUV, which was engulfed in 12 feet of water during the flood, San Angelo police said.\n\nKendall County officials also reported a flood death. An additional four deaths were reported in Travis County and three in Burnet County, according to media reports.\n\nOver 850 people were rescued or evacuated from the Guadalupe River corridor, Kerr County officials said Saturday.\n\nCamp Mystic remains a major focus of concern. When the flash flood struck early on Friday, about 700 children were in residence, according to details provided Friday by Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. As of Saturday afternoon, there were 27 missing campers from the camp, said Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice.\n\nOne Camp Mystic camper, 8-year-old Sarah Marsh of Alabama, was confirmed among the dead, according to Mountain Brook, Alabama, Mayor Stewart Welch. Janie Hunt, 9, was also among the dead, The New York Times and CNN both reported. Other campers were also reported dead by news outlets on Saturday.\n\nPhotos of the flooding's aftermath at Camp Mystic showed abandoned bunkbeds covered with mud and girls' belongings flung about. Photos taken on Saturday show a damaged building at the camp missing one entire side, debris strewn about. A stuffed animal lies alongside a single sandal on the ground.\n\nThe camp is located in central Texas' Kerr County, about 60 miles northwest of San Antonio. Generations of Texas families sent their daughters to Camp Mystic, a place where they formed lifelong friendships, former camper Clair Cannon told USA TODAY. Cannon's mother and daughter both also attended.\n\nSummer after summer, they'd take Highway 39 as it winds along the Guadalupe River until arriving at the grounds on the riverbank.\n\n“What that area is like when it’s in its prime – when it’s not devastated like this – is probably one of the most serene and peaceful places that I’ve ever seen in my life,” said Cannon, a commercial and residential real estate agent in Dallas. “That part of Texas is just absolutely gorgeous.”\n\nNow, much of the area is feeling the impact of the catastrophic flooding as rescuers race to find any survivors and recover victims. There is an unknown number of people missing, Rice said, adding that officials can't begin to estimate true numbers because there may be an untold number of people visiting the region on vacation.\n\nResponders have been pulling survivors out of trees and finding them stranded on higher ground.\n\nAuthorities haven't released further information about the victims as they continue to identify them and notify family members.\n\nTerrain and timing conspired to cause 'horrifying' Texas rainfall\n\nTexas Hill Country is no stranger to extreme flooding. In the rugged, rolling terrain it’s known for, heavy rains collect quickly in its shallow streams and rivers that can burst into torrents like the deadly flood wave that swept along the Guadalupe River on July 4.\n\nSeveral factors came together at once – in one of the worst possible locations – to create the “horrifying” scenario that dropped up to 16 inches of rainfall in the larger region over July 3-5, said Alan Gerard, a recently retired storm specialist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nOn July 4, rain was falling at 3-4 inches per hour, with some locations recording a deluge of up to 7 inches of rain in just three hours, the National Weather Service said.\n\nTerrain and timing were the biggest factors in the storms, said Gerard and Victor Murphy, a recently retired National Weather Service meteorologist in Texas.\n\nRead the whole story here.\n\n-Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nKendall County reports flood death\n\nThe death toll from the catastrophic flooding includes one individual in Kendall County, according to a county press release.\n\n\"We are saddened to report that one fatality has been confirmed at this point in Kendall County,\" the release states.\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\n27 campers still missing, hundreds rescued official says\n\nKerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said during a July 5 news conference that 27 Camp Mystic campers were still missing.\n\nRice didn’t have a number for how many other people are missing.\n\n“Right now we’re kind of looking at this in two ways,” Rice said. “Call it the known missing, which is the 27 camp kids that are missing. We will not put a number on the other side because we just don’t know.”\n\nRice said authorities are still intensely focused on rescue efforts.\n\n“We’ve been rescuing people out of these camps by the hundreds all day,” he said.\n\nAsked about the procedure for communicating to camps along the river about evacuating, Rice said the flooding happened “very fast,” with waters rising rapidly in a short time span.\n\n“There wasn’t a lot of time in this case,” he said.\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\nSheriff reports updated death toll\n\nKerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said July 5 that the death toll in the county now stands at 43.\n\nThe deaths include 28 adults and 15 children, Leitha said. Authorities are still working to identify 12 adults and five children.\n\nLeitha said hundreds of first responders continue to search the area.\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\nSan Angelo police report woman's death\n\nAbout 150 miles from Kerrville, the community of San Angelo and surrounding Tom Green County were hit with a record-breaking 14 inches of rain July 4 and police discovered Tanya Burwick's body the next day.\n\nBurwick, 62, was found dead the morning of July 5 in San Angelo, several blocks from her SUV, which was engulfed in 12 feet of water during Friday's flood, San Angelo police said.\n\nPolice and rescue personnel quickly launched a coordinated search effort July 4 after a report of a missing woman who was last seen driving in an area hit by the rising floodwaters, police said in a media release July 5.\n\n\"During the course of our investigation, the individual's vehicle was located, still submerged beneath the floodwaters,\" police said. \"Upon confirming that the vehicle was unoccupied, our team immediately expanded the search into the surrounding area.\"\n\nThey continued the search into the evening of July 4, but it was eventually suspended because of safety concerns and conditions, police said. The search resumed early July 5.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy as we extend our deepest condolences to Ms. Burwick’s family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,\" police said in the media release. \"The San Angelo Police Department stands with the entire community in mourning this tragic loss.\"\n\n- Trish Choate\n\nGov. Abbott: Search to continue until everyone is found\n\nGov. Greg Abbott in a Saturday afternoon news conference reiterated that search and rescue teams would continue working until everyone was accounted for. He signed an expanded declaration disaster and said the Trump administration has pledged its full support.\n\n\"He's deeply concerned for all the families,\" Abbott said.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristy Noem said she was giving President Donald Trump updates from the ground throughout the day and would be visiting Camp Mystic later Saturday.\n\n\"Know that President Trump is absolutely heartbroken by what has happened here in Texas and the loss of life is absolutely devastating to him and Melania,\" Noem said.\n\nCamp Mystic alum remembers the place lifelong bonds are formed\n\nCannon, 45, is the second of three generations of women to attend Camp Mystic. Cannon's mother, Emily Morrill, 75, attended camp for eight years and was later a counselor. She ensured from birth that Cannon would attend camp like she did.\n\nCannon later sent her daughter, Jaclyn, for a decade beginning at age 8, the minimum age to attend Mystic. Cannon’s daughter, now a 19-year-old college student, knew counselors currently at the camp, including where flooding was most devastating.\n\nThe girls wouldn’t have phone access for the weekslong camp, though there was no cell service in that part of Hill Country anyway.\n\nGirls at camp formed lifelong bonds with other attendees, Cannon recalled. Cannon’s family is friends with the Eastlands, whose family have owned the camp property for decades. Dick and Tweety Eastland, who are just younger than Morrill, lived on the property and ran summer camps. Dick Eastland was known for teaching the girls to fish, Cannon said.\n\nAlong Highway 39, there’s a big sign reading \"Mystic\" atop a hill, Cannon said. It let girls know they’re almost to camp, or if they were leaving, they wouldn’t see friends until next summer.\n\n“It always makes you cry,” Cannon said.\n\nRescuers worked all night to find survivors, victims\n\nA \"24/7\" rescue effort was underway, Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Friday evening. Over 200 people were rescued from the floodwaters, said Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Suelzer, the commander of the Texas National Guard.\n\nAbbott shared a video to social media of a responder dangling from a helicopter to rescue someone stranded in a tree with floodwaters below.\n\n\"Rescue teams worked throughout the night and will continue until we find all our citizens,\" the Kerrville Police Department said Saturday morning.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told reporters Friday that his office has been in contact with the White House multiple times. President Donald Trump told state officials “whatever we need, we will have,” Patrick said.\n\nCamp director identified among the dead\n\nA few miles away from Camp Mystic along the Guadalupe River, another girls' camp said its director was killed in the flooding. The Heart O' the Hills Camp said it was not in session when the flooding hit and most people who were at camp have been accounted for, but camp officials received word that Director Jane Ragsdale had died.\n\n\"We are mourning the loss of a woman who influenced countless lives and was the definition of strong and powerful,\" the camp said on its website. \"We at the camp are stunned and deeply saddened by Jane’s death. She embodied the spirit of Heart O’ the Hills and was exactly the type of strong, joyful woman that the camp aimed to develop with the girls entrusted to us each summer.\"\n\nHeart O' the Hills is still assessing the damage to its facilities, \"but it is serious,\" the camp said. The camp will not open for its next scheduled session, which was to start on July 6.\n\nWhat is Camp Mystic? What to know about century-old girls camp\n\nMore than 750 girls were at Camp Mystic in Texas Hill Country when heavy rains and flooding hit the region Friday, July 4. The private nondenominational Christian camp, founded in 1926, is located along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, one of 15 counties covered in Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's disaster declaration.\n\nFlash flooding caused river waters to increase 29 feet rapidly near the camp, officials said. As of Saturday, July 5, there were 27 campers among the missing.\n\nCamp Mystic for Girls was founded by Edward \"Doc\" Stewart, who was the football and men's basketball coach at the University of Texas, according to an Internet Archive's capture of the camp's website (much of the site was overwhelmed with traffic on Saturday).\n\nThe camp has been in operation since then. However, during World War II it served as a \"rehabilitation and recovery camp for army air corps veterans,\" according to the site.\n\n‒ Mike Snider\n\nFlooding threat continues on Saturday, forecasters say\n\nAs rescuers continue their search for missing people on Saturday, forecasters at the National Weather Service said the threat of catastrophic flooding and heavy rainfall was not yet over. That's because the system dumping rain over central Texas has slowed as it crawls over the state.\n\nThe weather service in Austin and San Antonio said a flood watch was in effect in the region until at least 7 p.m. local time on Saturday. Between 2 and 4 inches of additional rain are expected, with isolated amounts up to 10 inches, the weather service said.\n\n\"It is very difficult to pinpoint where exactly the isolated heavy amounts will occur in this pattern,\" the weather service said, warning people to pay attention to the weather.\n\nThe danger has extended to Travis, Williamson and Burnet counties, where very dangerous flash flooding is ongoing Saturday morning. Between 5 and 12 inches of rainfall has fallen there, the weather service said, calling it a \"Particularly Dangerous Situation with life-threatening flash flooding.\"\n\nA flood that came with terrifying swiftness\n\nThe flooding began sometime after 4:00 a.m., when extreme rains of as much as 12 inches an hour hit, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a press conference Friday afternoon.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued a flood watch for parts of south-central Texas, including Kerr County, on Thursday. It warned that a slow-moving system could potentially bring major storms to the area.\n\nThe rain that fell was even more intense.\n\nAt 2:03 a.m. the National Weather service issued its fifth warning of the evening, each of which had been more strident than the last.\n\nThis one said \"This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW! Life threatening flash flooding of low water crossings, small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.\"\n\nKerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said he had been jogging along the Guadalupe River trail at 3:30 a.m. and saw only light rain and no signs of flooding.\n\nBy 5:00 a.m. officials were beginning to get phone calls, and he and the area fire chief went to a local park to survey the scene.\n\n\"Within an hour and a half, [the river] had already risen over 25 feet,\" Rice said. \"Within a matter of minutes it was up to 29 feet.\"\n\nMeteorologist Matthew Cappucci explained in a post on X that rainfall in the area totaled over 10 inches, but \"annual rainfall for this region is about 28-32 inches.\"\n\n\"Imagine 4 months’ worth of rain falling in a 6-hour window,\" he said.\n\nThe stretch of the Guadalupe River near Bergheim, Texas, located about 35 miles north of San Antonio \"rose 40 FEET IN 3 HOURS,\" he added.\n\n‒ Doyle Rice and Elizabeth Weise\n\nSan Angelo also hit with flooding\n\nIn San Angelo, about 150 miles from Kerrville in the central part of the state, local officials said the northeast area of the city was the hardest hit. As of late July 4, officials were working to search for one missing person, a city government Facebook post said.\n\nThe PaulAnn Baptist Church had temporary shelter available to residents. Meanwhile, a disaster relief fund opened through the nonprofit San Angelo Area Foundation to help people affected by the storm. The United Way of the Concho Valley was also accepting donations for nonperishable foods, clothes and water at Concho Valley Turning Point’s warehouse.\n\n“We couldn’t be more thankful for everyone who has showed up to be a hand up to our neighbors,” the local United Way said in a Facebook post.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/05"}]}

This would include widespread rainfall, of which little is in the forecast. All of Southern California is expected to be drier than average over the next two weeks, according to a Monday forecast from the Climate Prediction Center.\n\nZehr said there may be some light showers next week, but nothing substantial. One concern about any heavy rain that might fall is that it might trigger mudslides in areas charred by the fires, the city of Los Angeles warned at a recent news conference.\n\nIs there still such a thing as a fire season in California?\n\n“We don’t have a fire season anymore; we have a fire year,\" Steelman said. \"It is hard on communities and residents because they need to remain vigilant. At the same time, firefighters do not get much downtime because they are working year-round.”\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom confirmed this last week, saying: \"November, December, now January − there’s no fire season, it’s fire year. It’s year-round.\"\n\nAre Santa Ana winds common this time of year?\n\n“Santa Ana winds are typical for this time of year, but the drought and dryness are not ... This is yet one more sign that our climate is changing,\" Steelman said. \"Drought is a climate signal.\"\n\nIn addition, she said that having Santa Anas that are 80-100 mph is \"not typical. Those are pretty ferocious wind speeds and make firefighting very difficult. Aircraft and water drops are not as effective under those conditions and wind-driven embers leap over fire lines. Those are very dangerous conditions for firefighters and pilots.\"\n\nAnd in California, though the Santa Ana winds and dryness are sometimes par for the course, climate change is leading to fire season starting earlier and ending later, according to CalFire. Longer and more intense dry seasons make forests more susceptible to severe wildfires.\n\nHow unusual was it for these blazes to proliferate in January?\n\n“It is highly unusual to have fires in January like this – attributed to the very dry winter that Southern California is experiencing after a very dry summer combined with the Santa Ana winds,” Steelman said.\n\nAnd could California see something like this again anytime soon?\n\n\"Yes, it could,\" said Wara, senior director for policy at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. Wara noted that the best way to prevent what happened last week is to build fire-resilient communities.\n\nSteelman said, \"It all depends on people and Mother Nature − will the drought break? Will the winds cease? And will people be vigilant about not creating conditions for ignitions? For the sake of all the Californians who are suffering right now, I hope the answer to all those questions is yes.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/fire/2025/01/08/how-did-the-california-wildfires-near-los-angeles-start-what-to-know/77557596007/", "title": "How did the California wildfires near Los Angeles start? What to know", "text": "Jan. 8, 2025 Updated Jan. 9, 2025, 12:48 p.m. ET\n\nFire officials are investigating the causes of multiple wildfires that are destroying homes and forcing thousands to evacuate across parts of Southern California on Wednesday.\n\nThe Palisades Fire started burning around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday and has scorched thousands acres around the beach towns of Santa Monica and Malibu. Around 6:30 p.m., the Eaton Fire broke out in Altadena near Pasadena and swelled to more than 10,000 acres. By 10:30 p.m. a smaller blaze named the Hurst Fire had ignited in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown Los Angeles and consumed about 500 acres.\n\nThe cause of all three blazes are still under investigation, according to Cal Fire. But the powerful Santa Ana winds are likely driving their rapid growth.\n\n\"The combination of low humidity, dry fuels and shifting winds has heightened the potential for spot fires and rapid expansion,\" Cal Fire said in an update.\n\nHow do wildfires start? The natural and artificial causes of wildfires explained.\n\nEven before the fires started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County. The weather service office in Los Angeles warned Monday that wind gusts could reach 100 mph in some areas this week, prompting \"extreme fire behavior\" wherever blazes ignited.\n\n\"This is a particularly dangerous situation − in other words, this is about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather,\" the weather service office in Los Angeles warned Monday. \"Stay aware of your surroundings. Be ready to evacuate, especially if in a high fire risk area. Be careful with fire sources.\"\n\nWhat causes wildfires?\n\nA wildfire, an uncontrolled blaze that occurs on open land with vegetation, can be ignited by natural or artificial causes.\n\nLightning is the most common natural cause of wildfires. In higher elevations lightning sometimes strikes dry vegetation, which sparks a fire that can easily become uncontrollable, particularly when fueled by dry winds.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nIn cities with roads near wildlife, such as in Southern California, it is very common for vehicles to unknowingly ignite a fire, Luca Carmignani, a Fire Advisor from the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n'We can expect to see larger wildfires': Climate change helping drive an increase in large wildfires in the US\n\n“For example, you have a truck with a train that drags on the road and generates sparks,” Carmignani said. “Or you have like a catalytic converter, there are different ways that cars and trucks can start a fire from the road.”\n\nStrong winds can cause power lines to move, which may generate sparks that eventually land on dry fuel such as grass or vegetation, Carmignani said. He added that unextinguished campfires are also a prevalent human cause of wildfires.\n\nIs it wildfire season?\n\nHistorically, wildfire season typically begins in July and ends around late November to early December, Carmignani said. This time of year has the driest conditions which are perfect for igniting and burning vegetation.\n\nLast month, the Franklin Fire in scenic Malibu was quickly contained while November’s Mountain Fire burned tens of thousands of acres, destroyed and damaged hundreds of homes in western Ventura County and was the third most destructive wildfire in Southern California since at least 2013, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nLive updates: Fatalities and injuries reported as Southern California wildfires rage\n\nThe National Weather Service's Los Angeles office issued a red flag alert Tuesday, the first in January since 2021, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"November, December, now January − there’s no fire season, it’s fire year. It’s year-round,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a press conference.\n\nClimate change causing concern\n\n\"Climate change is leading to larger and more severe wildfires in the western United States,\" the 2023 National Climate Assessment reported. Warmer temperatures create conditions that make fire behaviors more dangerous, the assessment found.\n\nJon Keeley, a senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, previously told USA TODAY climate change isn’t the only reason for the increase in large fires.\n\nIn California, population growth, increasing fire ignitions and the Santa Ana winds are bigger factors in wildfires, Keeley said. These factors don’t appear to be affected by climate change right now, and climate change is likely to be a bigger driver in the northern part of the state rather than the south, he said.\n\nContributing: John Bacon and Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/12/los-angeles-wildfire-updates-sunday/77638871007/", "title": "Los Angeles wildfires: Death toll climbs as crews race to combat winds", "text": "Jan. 12, 2025 Updated Jan. 13, 2025, 9:01 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the LA fires for Sunday, Jan. 12. For the latest updates on the Los Angeles wildfires in California, please read USA TODAY'S live updates for Monday, Jan. 13.\n\nLOS ANGELES — Wildfires that have ignited across the Los Angeles area have left a trail of destruction, killing at least 24 people and destroying thousands of structures, officials said Sunday.\n\nIn an update Sunday evening, the County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner said a total of 24 people have died due to the wildfires. The cases remain under investigation by the department, which noted that only 10 have been confirmed as human remains.\n\nEfforts to gain an upper hand against the deadly infernos continued on Sunday as ominous new wind warnings as flames threatened additional Southern California communities. Aircraft unloaded water and fire retardant on hills where the Palisades Fire — the most destructive in the history of Los Angeles — has scorched over 23,000 acres, destroying more homes, businesses, and numerous landmarks.\n\nThe expansion of the Palisades Fire, which was 13% contained, to the north and east spurred officials to issue evacuation orders and warnings to the west of the 405 freeway as the blaze put parts of Encino and Brentwood in peril.\n\nOfficials acknowledged that progress had been made but warned resurging winds could complicate efforts and enhance the risk level. Santa Ana winds that have fueled the blazes for the past week were picking up Sunday morning in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, then were expected to weaken in the afternoon before strengthening Sunday night through Wednesday, with the worst of it occurring on Tuesday.\n\nNorth-northeast wind gusts between 35 to 55 mph were possible, according to Rich Thompson, an incident meteorologist with the National Weather Service. A red flag warning is in effect until Wednesday and Thompson warned that in addition to the strong winds, low humidity and dry vegetation will contribute to very critical fire conditions.\n\n\"We're not out of the woods yet. We have some very significant fire weather ahead of us,\" Nancy Ward, director of the California Office of Emergency Services, said during a news conference Sunday afternoon. \"We've prepositioned additional engines, fire crews, helicopters, bulldozers, water tenders across all of Southern California ... all poised to assist and support the additional fire threat.\"\n\nThe Palisades Fire is one of six blazes that have erupted since Tuesday, obliterating neighborhoods and leaving a catastrophic trail of destruction. Three of the six fires remained active on Sunday.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ More than 12,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed by the wildfires, which have consumed about 40,300 acres of total land, according to CalFire.\n\n∎ Evacuation orders throughout the Los Angeles area now cover 105,000 residents. Another 87,000 residents have been warned that they may have to evacuate, fire officials said.\n\n∎ The containment status of all three active fires: Palisades 13%; Eaton 27%; Hurst 89%. Three other blazes — Kenneth, Sunset, and Sunswept — have been contained.\n\n∎ California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an investigation into water supply issues that may have impeded firefighters' efforts.\n\n∎ The Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest school district in the U.S., will reopen almost all schools on Monday. The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District said all Santa Monica schools, with the exception of Roosevelt Elementary, will also reopen on Monday. Meanwhile, Malibu schools will be closed through Wednesday and the Pasadena Unified School District will be closed through Friday.\n\nThe unrelenting toll: From unhoused folks to beachfront Malibu homeowners, wildfires hit all of LA society\n\nIn Altadena, a checkerboard of destruction\n\nFirefighters from Mexico, Canada, and several other nearby states are assisting local and state personnel in combatting the blazes, according to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nArizona firefighters on Sunday were among those monitoring Altadena, California, a community north of Pasadena, where a mix of life past and present coexisted in the wake of the Eaton Fire. The fire has scorched over 14,000 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\n“We're really trying to button up the area as best as possible before any anything else, before that wind comes in,” said Captain Shaun Jones of Central Arizona Fire and Medical about the threat of further fire from more Santa Ana winds forecast for early in the week.\n\nResidential streets to the north alternated, randomly, between the houses lost to the fire that rolled down from the mountain early last week and those that withstood the inferno. Children’s playsets were covered in soot and swimming pools looked like black lagoons. Grayed-out chimneys were all that remained intact on most properties.\n\nJones said Central Arizona Fire had brought five engine trucks and a water tank to the scene and were doing tactical patrols to prevent flare-ups.\n\nA seemingly unaffected yellow bungalow provided a pop of color on one devastated street. A squirrel could be seen running in front of the house that was guarded by a white picket fence. A fully stocked Little Free Library post stood curbside.\n\nA small older-model Ford pickup appeared emblematic of the neighborhood’s condition — the front half of the white truck was toasted brown by the flames, while the rear had gone unscathed.\n\n— Jose R. Gonzalez, Arizona Republic\n\nNewsom: Death toll 'likely' to increase\n\nEarlier Sunday, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna reported that 14 people have died so far, but acknowledged that the numbers might be different from those of the medical coroner.\n\nLuna said search and rescue recovery operations involving the county sheriff’s department, coroner’s office, and county fire department are ongoing. Authorities are now conducting grid searchers with cadaver dogs, according to Luna.\n\n“I don't expect good news from those,” Luna said.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Medical Examiner reported 24 fire-related deaths on Sunday evening. Eight deaths occurred in the Palisades Fire while 16 occurred in the Eaton Fire, according to the medical examiner.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there's likely to be a lot more\" fatalities in the wildfires devastating the Los Angeles area.\n\n\"We always have to be careful on the death toll,\" he said. \"I've got search and rescue teams, we've got cadaver dogs out, and there's likely to be a lot more.\"\n\nDiscussions on returning evacuees to their homes will start Thursday\n\nDuring Sunday's news conference, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said efforts to allow people from evacuation zones back to their communities will begin after the \"next predicted red flag ends on Wednesday.\"\n\n\"To all residents, please be assured that we will continue to be here for you until the last fire is completely extinguished,\" Marrone said. \"We stand alongside all of you as we begin to plan for the repopulation of evacuated areas, establishment of disaster recovery centers, and the rebuilding of your homes, your communities, and your lives.\"\n\nOfficials will begin talks on repopulating areas under evacuation orders and warnings \"first thing Thursday,\" according to Marrone.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Traci Park said curfews remain in place for the Pacific Palisades and Brentwood neighborhoods, which is a \"measure that is necessary to ensure public safety, as high winds are expected to pick up again.\"\n\n\"(The Palisades Fire) remains active, and as others have said, this situation is far from over,\" Park said. \"Pacific Palisades still faces dangerous conditions, including downed power lines, broken gas and water pipes and now slide conditions because of water activity.\"\n\nPark noted that the Los Angeles Police Department has suspended operations escorting residents back into evacuation zones to receive essential items due to the anticipated wind conditions and to bring utility personnel into the area to stabilize on-ground conditions.\n\nFire agencies investigating whether electrical equipment caused Hurst Fire\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Edison International and Southern California Edison — the primary electric utility company for much of the region — said fire agencies are investigating whether Edison electrical equipment was involved in the Hurst Fire.\n\nThe fire was reported at around 10:10 p.m. on Jan. 7 and preliminary information revealed that a circuit experienced a relay about a minute later, according to the company. A downed power line that was associated with the circuit was also found but Southern California Edison said it \"does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire.\"\n\nMinutes to flee: How the Palisades Fire rapidly expanded, devastating LA communities\n\nLos Angeles officials warn residents against scams\n\nLos Angeles officials are warning of scammers who are \"actively targeting vulnerable individuals and families (and) exploiting their distress\" during the deadly wildfires. In a Facebook post Sunday, the Los Angeles Police Department explained warning signs to help residents recognize and avoid common scams.\n\n\"Always trust your instincts. If something feels off, take a step back and verify before proceeding,\" the department said in the post.\n\nLuna also addressed scams at a briefing Sunday morning and said those taking advantage of residents would face consequences. Luna said he has talked to officials, including the state attorney general, district attorney, and U.S. attorney, who are \"eager to prosecute anybody who is taking advantage of our residents during this very difficult time.\"\n\nThat includes burglaries, white-collar crimes, and scams, Luna said, explaining he saw a man impersonating a firefighter in Malibu who was caught burglarizing a home.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Hope Karnopp, USA TODAY Network\n\nCommunity reduced to rubble looks to rebuild\n\nRoughly 24 hours after a raging wildfire forced Neal Flesner to flee his Pacific Palisades home, he decided to hike four and a half miles back into the area from Santa Monica, California, with a man he had just met.\n\nThe fire was still growing – erratically burning through brush in the mountains surrounding the Palisades. But Flesner, 48, told USA TODAY that he was propelled by a \"burning desire\" to see firsthand the damage the blaze had wrought to his and his wife Carmen’s \"happy place.\"\n\nWhen he and his new friend got there, they found both of their homes gone. Flesner’s entire neighborhood in the Alphabet Streets area of the Palisades had been reduced to rubble. The only structure still standing, almost untouched, was his garage.\n\nBut Flesner is determined to rebuild what was once there.\n\n\"It was like small town USA, like Main Street USA in Big City, Los Angeles,\" he said. \"I want to be part of the effort to just not rebuild the homes but rebuild the community, rebuild the culture, rebuild the life that we all shared and loved there.\" Read more here.\n\n— Karissa Waddick and Sandy Hooper\n\n16 reported missing; officials expect 'dozens' more\n\nAt least 16 people are reported missing as Los Angeles fire officials continue their search and rescue operations in areas devastated by the wildfires.\n\nThe tally includes 12 people in the Eaton fire and four in the Palisades fire, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said in Sunday’s press briefing. No children have been reported missing, so far.\n\nLuna said the sheriff’s department had received “dozens and dozens” of reports in the morning before the press briefing and will update the numbers accordingly.\n\nHe urges those with missing loved ones to contact their local law enforcement agency. People can also fill out an online form set up by the American Red Cross, which asks to provide as much detail as possible.\n\nUCLA a 'ghost town' amid remote operations during wildfires\n\nEvacuation zones have moved closer to UCLA, located in Los Angeles' Westwood neighborhood, and warnings and orders were in place near the campus. The university will host classes online until Jan. 17 after shutting down in-person lectures last week.\n\nThough the sky over Westwood was powder blue and the brown pall of wildfire smoke consigned to the western edge of the sky, the UCLA campus was quiet on Sunday afternoon. A scattered few people moved through the heart of campus.\n\n\"It’s a ghost town,\" said Jeff Hall, a Brentwood, California, resident who walking through the campus with friends. Hall, founder of the Brentwood News, said he’s been staying with friends in Westwood since his home lost electricity.\n\n“We’re sleeping better,” he said. “I feel like we’re relaxing.”\n\nAllie Greene, a Westwood resident, brought her dog Piper for a walk on the grassy hill below the university’s Powell Library. The beaches Greene normally visits have had access restricted during the Palisades Fire.\n\n\"I just needed to get out and clear my head,\" Greene said.\n\nShe said she has kept a close eye on the fire’s progress, packing some non-essential items in her car and staging essentials by the door in case she needs to leave in a hurry.\n\n\"I will leave if we get an (evacuation warning). I’m not gonna wait until we get (an order),\" she said.\n\nShe watched the 2019 Getty Fire stop before it could cross east over the concrete and asphalt of the 405 Freeway and said it gave her a false sense of security.\n\n\"You feel like you’re following along with Cal Fire and you understand (what’s happening),\" she said, until things suddenly take a turn. \"It’s the winds. It’s the embers.\"\n\n— Isaiah Murtaugh, Ventura County Star\n\nTrump invited to survey destruction\n\nLos Angeles Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger told reporters Sunday she invited President-elect Donald Trump − who takes office on Jan. 20 − to visit the county to get a first-hand look at the destruction.\n\n\"In my years at the county, I've seen time and time again how essential a partner the federal government is when responding to an emergency and helping out communities recover,\" she said.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she had a phone conversation with his administration to discuss the timing of such a visit.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has repeatedly attacked Newsom on social media as the wildfires have raged in the southern part of the Golden State, often misspelling the governor's last name as \"Newscum.\"\n\n\"The fires are still raging in L.A. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out. Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place... they just can't put out the fires. What's wrong with them?\" he said on his Truth Social media feed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi and Reuters\n\nCanada to send firefighting help\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office released a statement Friday saying his Cabinet ministers were in touch with officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and standing by for any additional requests.\n\nFire crews, aircraft and equipment from Canada, including from British Columbia and Quebec, were among the first on the scene to help battle the fires, according to the statement.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith and Ontario Premier Doug Ford also pledged their support. Ford later posted on X that he had directed every available water bomber to fight the fires.\n\n\"We’ll provide whatever personnel and equipment is needed and spare no expense to help our closest friends and allies,\" he said.\n\nIn 2023, Canada had an extreme wildfire season, and the U.S. sent more than 2,000 firefighters to help, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\n– Miguel Torres\n\nMexico offers support; California 'deeply grateful'\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo said in a news conference Friday that the country's secretary of foreign affairs had spoken with President Joe Biden and Newsom about sending support to Los Angeles.\n\nThe support team will include firefighters from Mexico’s National Forestry Commission and the National Secretary of Defense.\n\n“We are going to send support, not just because the people and government of Mexico have always been giving, but also because there are many Mexican people in this zone of the United States,” she said.\n\nShe added that her government was coordinating with the U.S. to get the team dispatched.\n\nNewsom issued a statement on X saying California was \"deeply grateful\" for Sheinbaum's support. Read more here.\n\n– Miguel Torres\n\nLos Angeles fires like 'visiting war zones'\n\nActive duty U.S. military personnel stand ready to deploy to contain wildfires that have ripped through Los Angeles, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell said on Sunday in an interview on ABC's \"This Week\" program.\n\nCriswell also said FEMA has the funding needed to support its response effort to the wildfires.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was also on the program Sunday. He said he took a tour of the devastation and was reminded of the remnants left behind in an international conflict area.\n\n\"That frankly reminded me of visiting war zones, seeing that kind of devastation, just house after house, block after block,\" Schiff said.\n\nIn the past, he continued, California wildfires have sometimes left sporadic damage, where one house would be lost but others around it were fine.

For the latest updates on the LA fires, follow USA TODAY's live coverage for Tuesday, Jan. 14.\n\nLOS ANGELES − Ominous winds were expected to regain strength Monday, howling through fire-blackened trees, picking up plumes of ash and smoke and further tangling efforts to tamp down the explosion of fires across Los Angeles County that have killed at least 24 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses.\n\nThe winds could threaten the incremental progress firefighters made over the weekend with multiple fires. The winds that had eased somewhat Sunday, allowing firefighters and rescue crews to begin gaining some control, were forecast to return later Monday, with coastal winds reaching 40-50 mph.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Los Angeles office highlighted Red Flag Warning areas in Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties that received the rare \"particularly dangerous situation'' designation, saying those are for \"the extreme of the extreme fire weather scenarios.'' The Red Flag Warnings for a larger stretch of Southern California are in place from Monday through Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Conditions are expected to worsen for these locations by Tuesday morning as wind gusts near 70 mph will be possible,\" NWS meteorologist Walter Otto said in a Monday weather update, citing the wind combined with low relative humidity and lack of recent rainfall. \"These locations will be under a high risk for large fires with potential for very rapid spreading of any fires that may develop.\"\n\nThe weather service said \"critical to extremely critical fire weather conditions'' are predicted for the full coastal area in Southern California through Wednesday, stretching all the way down to San Diego, prompting officials to pre-position firefighting crews in vulnerable locations.\n\nThe number of people under evacuation orders dropped to 92,000 on Monday, down from almost 200,000 people days ago, Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna said at a morning briefing. Another 89,000 were under evacuation warnings.\n\nLuna urged residents still being kept from their homes to be patient while \"grid searching\" for victims continues. He said he expects the death toll to rise.\n\n\"It is a very grim task, and unfortunately every day that we do this we are running across the remains of individuals, community members,\" Luna said. \"That is not easy work.\"\n\nMore than 1,800 properties have been searched, he said, adding that 34 arrests have been made ranging from curfew violations to looting.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, the two most damaging active blazes, were 14% and 33% contained, respectively, according to Cal Fire's latest updates Monday night. Meanwhile, the Hurst Fire near Sylmar, California, was 97% contained.\n\n∎ At least 24 people — most of which remained unidentified — have died between the Eaton and Palisades fires, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's update Monday afternoon. The Palisades Fire had at least eight deaths, according to medical examiner records, and 16 people have died in the Eaton Fire.\n\n∎ President-elect Donald Trump plans to visit the disaster zone after next Monday's inauguration, Reuters reported.\n\n∎ The announcement of the Oscar nominations was postponed from Jan. 17 to Jan. 23, and the voting deadline was extended, because of the fires.

The blaze, dubbed the Auto Fire, was first reported in the Santa Clara River bottom around 6:50 p.m. local time as Santa Ana winds whipped through the region.\n\nAs of early Tuesday, the blaze burned about five acres, according to Cal Fire. Ground crews and helicopters quickly rushed to the area, making water drops.\n\nAbout 75 firefighters were working on the fire, which was described as being in medium fuel and moving at a moderate rate of speed, the Ventura County Fire Department said in a statement on social media posted shortly before 9 p.m. local time\n\n— Ventura County Star\n\nOptimism, but more high winds coming\n\nIn the storied Topanga Canyon off the Pacific Coast Highway, meditation teacher Seth Monk helped distribute coffee, gas and propane to residents who remained despite evacuation orders. The narrow canyon community sits between the blaze burning in Pacific Palisades and Malibu, which Monk said “looked like a volcano” last week.\n\nMany celebrities live in the area, mixing with longtime resident hippies and people who have fled the urban sprawl of Los Angeles. Among those who’ve called Topanga home or passed through are Neil Young, Jim Morrison and Danny Elfman, along with actor Joshua Jackson, whose house burned down last week.\n\nMonk said the clear blue skies were a cause for optimism.\n\n“The feeling is that we’re at the tail end of it and yet, because there's so much dry fuel between us and the fire and the wind is picking up, it is possible the fire could come back,” he said, as grateful residents poured oat milk into organic coffee provided by donors. “The situation appears to be getting better.”\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nWildfire victim has emotional reunion with dog\n\nAs the wildfires continue to rage in Southern California, a moment of hope broke through the smoke after a man was reunited with his dog.\n\nA video posted on X by NBC News correspondent Liz Kreutz shows Casey Colvin reuniting with Oreo after the dog spent five nights in the ash in the wake of the Palisades Fire, which destroyed their Pacific Palisades home.\n\nColvin, who wasn't home when the fire broke out on Jan. 7, rushed back to try and save his two dogs: Oreo and Tika Tika Tika.

Fire retardant\n\nImages of aircraft fighting the Los Angeles area fires by dumping a reddish-pink substance from the sky have prompted questions about its contents, use and safety.\n\nThe fire retardant, which has been used for more than 50 years to tamp down wildfires, is mostly made up of salts that \"alter the way the fire burns, decreases the fire intensity and slows the advance of the fire,\" according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service.\n\nMore than 440 million gallons of the product were dropped on blazes from 2009 to 2021, mostly in the western part of the country, where wildfires present a yearly challenge. However, the Forest Service forbids using the retardant near waterways or habitats of endangered species on federal lands because of environmental concerns.

The lawsuit cites multiple eyewitness accounts and images that appear to show a fire at the base of a transmission tower owned by the utility.\n\n“They knew like everyone else did of the severe weather warnings, dry weather, high wind gusts, they had tools they could have used to mitigate the wildfire risk,” said Iglesias’ attorney, Ali Moghaddas of the Edelson law firm. “They have choices when they face these moments and obviously they made the wrong one.”\n\nA spokesperson for Southern California Edison said the company could not comment directly on the lawsuit because it had not been served yet but said it was aware of the filing and vigorously defended its safety practices.\n\nThe company provides electricity for around 5 million customers, or about 10% of the people in the area, according to spokesperson Jeff Monford. A staff of meteorologists and fire scientists watch for potential wildfires and determine when the utility should shut down its equipment to avoid catastrophe, he said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n– Michael Loria\n\nFBI seeking tips on drone that damaged firefighting plane\n\nThe FBI is seeking information on the operator of a drone that collided with a \"Super Scooper\" firefighting airplane over the Palisades Fire last week, damaging the aircraft and grounding it for days as flames raged across Los Angeles County.\n\nThe plane, on loan from Canada, sustained damage when it collided with a drone about 1 p.m. Thursday, according to Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott. No injuries were reported.\n\n\"The collision left a 3-by-6-inch hole in the left wing,\" the FBI said in a statement. \"Parts of the heavily damaged drone were recovered.\"\n\nThe firefighting asset, known as \"Quebec 1,\" was expected to return to the skies Tuesday morning, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said.\n\n\"It has been repaired and we're waiting for the FAA to give us approval to fly again,\" he said.\n\n– Brian Day, Victorville Daily Press\n\nBanks offer mortgage relief for affected homeowners\n\nJPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are easing mortgage repayment conditions for customers affected by the devastating wildfires in Southern California.\n\nChase Home Lending is providing disaster forbearance for mortgage customers affected by the fires, parent firm JPMorgan said on Monday.

It often lasts until early-to-mid December, when colder temperatures move in and frost blankets the ground. Still, earlier this year, crews battled wildfires into January and February.\n\n“From a weather perspective, it’s really just seeing how the precipitation is going to develop over the next four to six weeks to really give us an idea of how bad fall fire season may or may not be,” Michael Cheek, the state forest service’s mountain division director, told the Citizen Times on Sept. 3.\n\nAfter above-normal precipitation in August, just half an inch of rain has fallen in the Asheville area so far in September, according to the National Weather Service. Normally, the area sees more than an inch at this point in the month. No rain is forecasted through Sept. 16.\n\nDowned trees could slow response\n\nMuch like they did during the active spring season — when wildfires broke out in Polk, Henderson, Haywood, Buncombe and other counties in the region — fire crews will have to navigate a newly altered landscape, one devastated by Helene.\n\nWhen the storm pummeled Western North Carolina last September, it caused nearly $60 billion in damage and killed more than 100 people.\n\nHelene’s high winds also damaged 822,000 acres of Western North Carolina timberland, according to a state damage appraisal published last October. In Mitchell County alone, wind gusts knocked down an estimated 100,000 trees.\n\nBuncombe County lost about 17%, or 50,000 acres, of forest, according to Ryan Cole, the county’s emergency services assistant director.\n\nMuch of what fell were hardwoods, like oak and hickory, Cole told the Citizen Times. As the downed trees dry out over the next few years, fire risk will increase with future fires likely burning even hotter. This comes as researchers from N.C. State University predict wildfires could grow larger in the Southern Appalachians because of more frequent and severe droughts fueled by climate change.\n\nIn some areas, according to Cheek, trees Helene downed are still connected to their root systems, producing leaves, which could pose problems during an active fall fire season.\n\n“We’re going to have another layer of leaves hanging up as ladder fuels to go up high,” Cheek said. “That’s just an increased risk right there.”\n\nThat increased risk comes on top of potentially slower response times as crews will be forced to navigate around, or over, fallen trees and log jams. Where normally it would take crews about 30 minutes to go in and place a fire line mid-slope, now might take three hours, Cole said.\n\nIn the region’s national forests, crews from the U.S. Forest Service have been working to reopen and restore access to impacted roads and trails historically used for fire suppression, Lisa Jennings, an agency spokesperson, told the Citizen Times.\n\nWhile access is improved, it’s still limited, especially in areas hard-hit by landslides or where rivers wiped out roads, Jennings said, noting some restoration projects are so complex they might take months or years to complete.\n\nBut for the U.S. Forest Service, restoring access is just one step when it comes to preparing for the fall wildfire season. The agency is bringing hundreds of firefighters to the region to stage in remote areas, Jennings said. It’s also planning to bring in more heavy equipment, like fire engines, to help speed up initial response times.\n\nAreas at greatest risk? How can residents prepare?\n\nAreas along North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Escarpment, where the Blue Ridge Mountains break down into the state’s foothills, could see increased risk this fall fire season, according to Cheek, of the state forest service. Burke, McDowell, Rutherford, Henderson, Polk and Buncombe counties are historically very dry, too, he said.\n\nTo prepare, officials are urging property owners to clean up leaves, debris and other combustibles within 50-100 feet of homes and structures, if possible, to limit the size of any fire ignition zone.\n\nEarlier this year, the Black Cove Complex Fire in Polk and Henderson counties scorched more than 7,600 acres, according to the North Carolina Forest Service, with around 250 homes evacuated. So far in 2025, more than 15,000 acres have burned in North Carolina, across more than 4,500 fires, according to agency data.\n\nIn Buncombe County, areas with southwestern-facing slopes are at greatest risk of wildfire, Cole said, because they’re receiving the most direct sunligh, drying out leaves and other debris. Those areas also took the brunt of Helene’s winds, he said, and are where many of the county’s trees were blown down during the storm.\n\nCole, too, is urging residents to maintain the areas around their homes, especially gutters and roofs, as strong winds could carry hot embers into the air.\n\n“If you have debris on your roof, it’s going to be extremely susceptible for a fire to occur there,” Cole said.\n\nNext week's forecast\n\nNo rain is forecasted in the Asheville area through Sept. 16, according to the National Weather Service. Highs are expected to reach the upper 70s and low 80s, with sunny skies.\n\nJacob Biba is the Helene recovery reporter at the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.

For the latest updates on the LA fires, follow USA TODAY's live coverage for Wednesday, Jan. 15.\n\nSANTA MONICA, Calif. – The powerful Santa Ana winds expected back in the Los Angeles area Tuesday probably won't materialize until late at night and early Wednesday, but they'll still be capable of stoking quickly spreading blazes, the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDespite milder-than-predicted conditions during much of the day, wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph in the mountains and 30 to 50 mph on the coasts and valleys are still forecast for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, only later than initially anticipated.\n\n\"Wind are weaker than expected today, but looking for one more enhancement late tonight and Wednesday,\" the weather service's Los Angeles office said Tuesday. \"Not quite out of the woods yet.\"\n\nRed Flag Warnings with the rare \"particularly dangerous situation\" designation issued for those counties will now be in effect from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time on Wednesday.\n\nScores of firefighters, including additional personnel from Canada, Mexico and other nearby U.S. states, have been combating the fires from the air and on the ground. Officials worry the high winds could further expand the Palisades and Eaton blazes as well as ignite and expand new ones.\n\nHigh winds combined with low humidity and a relentless drought have fueled the deadly wildfires that have destroyed entire neighborhoods and forced tens of thousands to flee their homes over the last eight days in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAt least 25 people have been killed in the fires, according to the Los Angeles Medical Examiner's Office. The wildfires have destroyed or damaged more than 12,000 homes, businesses, and other structures as officials ordered over 92,000 people to flee their homes.\n\nGet weather and fire alerts via text: Sign up to get current wildfire updates by location\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ President Joe Biden has decided the federal government will pick up the entire cost of emergency work California will require over six months because of the fires instead of only 75%, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said.\n\n∎ The Sheriff's office lifted evacuation orders for some communities in Altadena, hit hard by the Eaton Fire, starting at 3 p.m. PT Tuesday.\n\n∎ The Palisades Fire, which reduced the Pacific Palisades neighborhood to rubble, has consumed 23,713 acres and is 18% contained, according to Cal Fire. The agency said the Eaton Fire, located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, has burned 14,117 acres and is 35% contained.\n\n∎ California Gov. Gavin Newsom said 11 new fires broke out overnight, including the Auto Fire in Ventura County, but were quickly extinguished. By Tuesday night, the Auto Fire burned 61 acres and is 47% contained. The county's fire department said the blaze's forward progress was stopped.\n\nSet of remains tied to Eaton Fire determined to be not human\n\nIn an update Tuesday night, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office said a set of remains the office was investigating in connection to the Eaton Fire was determined to be non-human. The remains were discovered in Altadena.\n\nThe medical examiner's office also confirmed an additional death tied to the Palisades Fire, raising the death toll to at least 25. It is believed that nine people died in the Palisades Fire while 16 others died in the Eaton Fire.\n\nOf the 25 cases, 21 remains are confirmed to be human, according to the medical examiner's office. The remaining four cases are still being processed.\n\nLawsuit blames public utility for water supply failures\n\nMore than a dozen victims of the Pacific Palisades wildfire are suing the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for water supply failures they say contributed to the devastation of the Los Angeles inferno.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by residents and a pizzeria owner, blames the utility for hydrants drying up within hours of the blaze's ignition. The plaintiffs said they all lost their homes or businesses to the fire.\n\nThe LADWP, the largest U.S. municipal utility, should have maintained water in a nearby reservoir, which was dry at the time the flames erupted, the complaint said. The Santa Ynez Reservoir, which can hold as much as 117 million gallons of water, had been empty since February 2024, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe suit follows other legal actions in connection with the California wildfires. A group of residents and business owners recently sued Southern California Edison over the Eaton Fire.\n\n— Minnah Arshad\n\nAt least a dozen schools damaged in wildfires\n\nThousands of students across Los Angeles attend schools that were destroyed or damaged by wildfires that ravaged communities over the past week surrounding the nation's second most populous city.\n\nSome schools in the region that paused last week due to fire hazards were unharmed and have resumed instruction, while others remain in limbo about how they'll proceed amid the continuing threat from wildfires, school officials said.\n\nThe Palisades Fire, the Eaton Fire and others have burned more than 40,000 acres across Los Angeles since Jan. 7 and destroyed thousands of buildings, including at least a dozen K-12 schools, such as Palisades Charter High School, Marquez Charter Elementary School, and Eliot Arts Magnet Academy.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Kayla Jimenez\n\nSheriff urges thousands under evacuation warnings to flee\n\nOfficials urged the 84,800 residents in Los Angeles County under evacuation warnings Tuesday to start packing up and leaving their homes.\n\n“When we’re giving you warnings, that's probably the time you should think about going,” Sheriff Robert Luna said at a news conference Tuesday. “We recommend you go. Don’t wait until the order is given.”\n\nLuna said approximately 88,000 residents in the county remained under mandatory evacuation orders Tuesday morning. He said that while the number has decreased in recent days, the situation “is still very dangerous” as strong winds return to the region.\n\nA curfew will again be in place from 6 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday for areas scorched by the Palisades and Eaton fires.\n\nNonresidents and others caught in areas under evacuation orders during curfew are subject to arrest, Luna reiterated, adding that at least 11 people have been arrested for curfew violations.\n\nMapping the LA fires: See latest evacuation zones and fire locations\n\nFirefighters rush to beef up containment lines as strong winds return\n\nFirefighters battling the wildfires are focusing on reinforcing and maintaining containment lines as winds pick up throughout the region.\n\nCal Fire said in an update Tuesday morning that authorities will \"conduct tactical patrols and mop-up operations, addressing smoke and heat sources to minimize the chance of fire escaping the perimeter.\"\n\nAdditionally, urban search and rescue efforts as well as damage assessments were ongoing throughout areas torched by the blazes. \"These operations are unprecedented in size and scale and are critical for mitigating existing hazards, confirming missing persons reports, and obtaining accurate numbers of structures loss,\" Cal Fire said.\n\nHouses turned into 'highly toxic debris'\n\nWildfire evacuees returning to their homes in increasing numbers around Los Angeles are being warned to take special care in cleaning up toxic ash and debris.\n\nAuthorities have banned people from using leaf blowers to clean up ash due to the inhalation risk; are advising residents wipe down countertops and other surfaces; and use a mop to remove ash from floors instead of a vacuum.\n\nOfficials issued a blowing ash advisory and cautioned Los Angeles residents to stay indoors with the windows closed, and to wear an N-95 mask or respirator for protection. Dust and ash \"may cause irritation or exacerbate pre-existing health conditions, particularly for children, older adults, pregnant individuals, and those with heart or lung conditions,\" the Los Angeles County Public Health Department said.\n\nLos Angeles officials have not yet said when residents of the hardest-hit areas may be allowed to return.\n\nOne expert told USA TODAY that residents should start thinking about the destroyed neighborhoods in terms of the dangerous \"burn pits\" once used by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan to dispose of waste.\n\n“Residents should not, not, not, go home and sift through the debris,\" said Katie Arrington, an environmental cleanup expert who has been helping manage the aftermath of a suburban Denver 2021 wildfire that destroyed about 1,000 homes. \"It is highly toxic debris. It’s the mixing all the materials together, along with it burning. It’s not just your house, but your neighbors' houses, your car in the driveway.”\n\n'Like Iraq': Couple describes fires, looters\n\nPartners Robert Bullock and David Anderson stayed in their historic home just outside Pasadena as the Eaton Fire flared up last week. The flames later receded and people swept into the neighborhood for no other apparent reason than to loot the empty homes.\n\n“The first night or two, there were a lot of people with backpacks loitering,” Anderson said. “They were walking up and down driveways and streets.”\n\nThe pair relied on a rifle purchased some two years ago for security but were unable to fall asleep the first night of the fires.\n\n“The first two nights were terrible,” said Bullock, noting he could hear the booms of propane tanks and ammunition exploding in the distance as the fire raged. “It sounded like Iraq.”\n\n- Sam Morgen, The Desert Sun\n\nFormer contractor making do amid the destruction\n\nGeorge Wilken, 79, rode out the fire in Pacific Palisades, racing from spot fire to spot fire in his SUV with water and watching hopefully as firefighting planes dropped water to douse the flames. Although the retired general contractor saved some homes, he said, hundreds of his longtime neighbors lost theirs, including a handful of houses he’d built or remodeled over the years.\n\nA week later, he’s still in the evacuation zone, keeping an eye on his church, Palisades Lutheran, and making tea and cooking meals, including leftover Christmas ham, on a barbecue grill. Monday night he fried some shrimp after heating water on the grill to sponge off in a wash tub. He made bacon and eggs for breakfast Tuesday, keeping the food cool in a church refrigerator he occasionally powers with a small gas generator.\n\n“It’s makeshift but it’s home for a while,” he said. “It’s a little crazy, I know.”\n\nAt night Wilken had been returning to his nearby apartment. Without power or gas service, it’s easier to spend his days at the untouched church where he’s been clearing debris from the grounds and keeping an eye out for looters.\n\nWhile the church where Wilken helps with operations was untouched aside from ash that’s drifted through the doors, the Palisades Presbyterian church across the street burned to the ground. The fire was so intense it lofted and melted a piece of roofing copper from its tower, dropping it hundreds of feet away.\n\n“I’m just eating whatever’s available. It’s not like I can go to the market,” Wilken said Tuesday before cooking breakfast. “But I’ve got enough food for a week.”\n\nPolice searching for dozens of missing people amid fires\n\nLos Angeles authorities continued search and rescue operations, going door-to-door seeking missing people a week after a series of blazes began burning large swaths of Los Angeles County.\n\nLuna said 24 people remain missing in areas scorched by the Palisades and Eaton fires. He said those missing are all adults, adding that six of them are believed to be in the Eaton area and six in the Malibu area.\n\nMcDonnell said Los Angeles police officers were searching for eleven missing people as of Tuesday morning. So far, 21 people reported missing in the city have been found safe. The chief added that two people reported missing have most likely been \"found deceased, but have yet to be positively identified.\"\n\nCollege student reflects on 'strange time right now' in Malibu\n\nAn eerie calm pervaded over Malibu on Tuesday morning. Although the National Weather Service had forecast high winds for much of the surrounding area, little more than a cool breeze blew along the coast just north of Los Angeles.\n\nFirefighters cleared up smoldering hot spots and worked to tear down unstable structures that had been damaged last week by the Palisades Fire. Residents remain barred from certain parts of the city, as authorities work to bring back utilities and worry about looting.\n\nPepperdine University has been mostly unscathed. Parts of the private Christian school were scorched by the Franklin Fire in early December, but that created a buffer zone for the latest blaze. Most of the students were still on winter break when the Palisades Fire broke out Jan. 7, and they remained at home because the school moved to remote classes this week.\n\nSam Jones, a 22-year-old senior, trekked to his job at a gym from a nearby apartment. He credited the previous fire with protecting his apartment and the campus. But as he enters his last college semester, Jones yearns for a return to normalcy. Much of Malibu remains locked down, and many residents have not been allowed to return.\n\n“The city is just so weird right now,” Jones said “I’ve talked to some friends that live (outside) Malibu, and none of their houses have electricity. None of the gas stations are open, so they can’t even drive their cars because they just have no more gas left in them to get through the canyon. It’s a strange time right now.”\n\n− Sam Morgen, The Desert Sun\n\nLA mayor signs executive order focused on recovery, rebuilding\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she signed an executive directive in an attempt to cut red tape and streamline recovery and rebuilding operations. Bass said the order will address debris removal efforts and make available 1,400 housing units for those who have lost their homes in the fires.\n\n\"We're going to make it through these next few days but we want to begin to think about how we rebuild the massive destruction that I saw from the air,\" Bass said, referencing a helicopter tour she took of the disaster areas Monday. \"We don't want people burdened by red tape and bureaucracy.\"\n\nHigh wind speeds recorded across Los Angeles area\n\nHere are some of the highest wind speeds recorded early Tuesday across Los Angeles and Ventura counties, according to the National Weather Service office in L.A.\n\nMagic Mountain Truck Trail – 72 mph\n\nMillcreek RAWS – 62 mph\n\nSandstone Peak – 60 mph\n\nN3 Highway – 58 mph\n\nJulians Ridge – 56 mph\n\n3 arson suspects arrested, accused of starting fires across LA\n\nThree arson suspects have been arrested across the Los Angeles area since Sunday, the Los Angeles police chief told reporters Tuesday.\n\nChief Jim McDonnell said officers in North Hollywood responded to a call reporting a man was using a barbecue lighter to ignite fires. The man was arrested for an outstanding felony warrant for arson and booked into Van Nuys Jail, McDonnell said.\n\nTwo men had been arrested on arson charges Sunday. The first was taken into custody after people reported he lit a section of brush aflame, McDonnell said. The second arrest occurred in the west Los Angeles area, where a suspect had allegedly lit a trash can on fire. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to both incidents.\n\nWhen will it rain in Los Angeles?\n\nThe Los Angeles area may see light showers next week, but the rainfall is not expected to be substantial, said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr.\n\nIn fact, all of Southern California is expected to be drier than average over the next two weeks, according to a Monday forecast from the Climate Prediction Center.\n\nWhile heavy rain would certainly help firefighters battling the blazes across L.A County, there are concerns that torrential downpours might trigger mudslides in areas charred by the fires, city officials said.\n\n– Doyle Rice\n\nNine people arrested for looting; stolen Emmy Award recovered\n\nOfficials say nine people have been charged with looting while police recovered an Emmy Award and at least $200,000 in other items stolen from homes abandoned during wildfire evacuations in the Los Angeles area.\n\nAuthorities on Monday announced charges against nine people accused of burglaries and looting in the Eaton and Palisades fire areas. They also said they are pursuing charges against people accused of impersonating firefighters to improperly access evacuation zones.\n\nAuthorities have also arrested dozens of people accused of violating closure orders, and security has tightened across the evacuation areas. Officials did not release additional details Monday regarding who the Emmy belonged to. However, they said several of the people arrested had criminal records that could land them lengthy prison sentences if convicted.\n\nPacific Palisades resident: Homes couldn't escape firestorm\n\nAuthorities said it may be Thursday until evacuees are allowed to return home, as Red Flag Warnings are expected to last through Wednesday. Firefighters are continuing their assessments of burned areas, and on Monday evening reported that at least 5,000 structures had been destroyed in the Palisades Fire. A curfew remains in effect for much of the area.\n\nBeverley Auerbach and her husband, who lost the home they've lived in since 1980, fled to safety last Monday, thinking they would be gone just a few days. But the wind-driven firestorm burned through their Pacific Palisades neighborhood known as the Alphabets, scouring homes down to their concrete steps and brick chimneys.\n\nAuerbach said they still haven't seen what the area looks like in person, though a neighbor accessed the evacuation area and recorded some video for the neighborhood WhatsApp group chat.\n\n\"We all hoped that our home would be the one that the capricious winds would bypass,\" Auerbach, a travel marketing consultant, said via text. \"In our case, we had a clay tile roof and stucco walls with little wood trim, unlike our neighbors' homes with a lot of wood and composite shingles.\" Auerbach added: \"The truth is that in such a conflagration, with homes close together, none could escape, even those with wildfire protection. Still, we hope against hope until someone shows you a photo or video that settles the matter.\"\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/14"}]}

Andrew Cuomo.\n\nMamdani, a democratic socialist, campaigned on policies like free child care, free buses and a rent freeze.\n\nThe mayor-elect plans to fund his proposals with an additional tax on those earning over $1 million a year.\n\nMamdani's victory raises questions about the progressive direction of the Democratic Party.\n\nZohran Mamdani has pulled off a remarkable feat to become the next mayor of New York City.\n\nI’ll give him credit for that.\n\nMamdani, 34, rose from relative obscurity as a state assemblyman to defeat former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in June. Cuomo, 67, decided to stay in the race, however, as an independent. For the second time, Mamdani beat the much more experienced politician.\n\nWhat Mamdani lacks in credentials, he makes up for with charisma and youth, which clearly proved more appealing to the city’s voters – especially its younger ones.\n\nIt’s what he’s selling that I find alarming – and the fact that so many people bought it. Mamdani is a democratic socialist, and his policies are dangerous to this country’s ideals of free markets and individualism.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nSomeone's going to have to pay for Zohran Mamdani's free stuff\n\nJust look at Mamdani’s wish list.\n\nFrom the beginning, his campaign has focused on affordability and the high cost of living in the country’s most populous city. Mamdani’s plan includes everything from “free” childcare to “free” buses to a rent freeze. He also wants government-run grocery stores.\n\nThe problem with all this “free” stuff is that it isn’t, in fact, free. Someone is going to have to pay for it.\n\nAnd as Democrats are wont to do, Mamdani is planning to sic an additional 2% tax on those who make more than $1 million a year. (Luckily, he can’t do this all on his own. He would need sign-off from the state legislature and governor.)\n\nSo it’s no surprise that wealthy New Yorkers did their best to keep Mamdani out of office. Super PACs supporting Cuomo raised more than $40 million, with a lot of that funding coming from billionaires like Bill Ackman and Barry Diller.\n\nBarstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who has an estimated net worth of $250 million, said ahead of the election that he’d consider moving his company’s headquarters out of New York City if Mamdani won. Expect many more entrepreneurs and wealthy residents to leave New York City for more tax-friendly havens like Florida and Texas.\n\nIt’s much harder to pay for all these “free” programs when the evil rich people aren’t there to tax.\n\nDoes Mamdani's win signal where the Democratic Party is headed?\n\nMamdani’s win also raises questions beyond the Big Apple and about the future of the Democratic Party. Does the energy behind his win signal how far left the party is willing to go?\n\nIt’s true that Cuomo brought a lot of baggage. The former governor resigned from office in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. He also faced a lot of scrutiny for his COVID-19 policies related to nursing homes and the deaths of the elderly that followed.\n\nSo New Yorkers may have had enough of him.\n\nThere’s more to Mamdani’s victory than that, though. A growing coalition of progressive voters actively supports socialism.\n\nA recent Axios-Generation Lab poll of U.S. college students found that 67% say they have a positive or neutral view of the word \"socialism\" – compared with only 40% who held the same view of the word \"capitalism.\"\n\nParty differences predicted these views, with 47% of Democrats and 31% of independents reacting positively to socialism, while only 5% of Republicans did.\n\nAs Democrats seek to redefine themselves after the 2024 election losses, there’s growing pressure from rising stars like Mamdani and New York Rep.

It was Mamdani's second victory this year over the better-known former governor, who ran as an independent after Mamdani scored a stunning upset against him and other Democrats in a primary in June.\n\n\"New York, tonight you have delivered a mandate for change,\" Mamdani told a roaring crowd in his victory speech. \"A mandate for a new kind of politics. A mandate for a city we can afford. And a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that.\"\n\nMamdani led Cuomo by 50.4% to 41.6% as of 11 p.m. with 90% of the votes counted, with Sliwa at 7.1%, according to an Associated Press tally.\n\nMamdani's commanding win thrilled progressives, and won plaudits from more centrist Democrats who had shied away from backing him but saw the appeal of his affordability message. It also fired up Republicans, who blasted the incoming mayor as an extremist whose politics they will wield as a cudgel against other Democrats in next year's elections.\n\nMamdani, born in Uganda to a professor and a filmmaker from India, will be the first Muslim and first person of South Asian descent to lead the nation's largest city.\n\nMore than 2 million New Yorkers cast votes in the election, the largest turnout for a New York City mayoral election in almost 60 years. The last time more than 2 million votes were cast were for a three-way election in 1969 in which Mayor John Lindsay won a second term.\n\nA wave of support for Mamdani — and a campaign to stop him\n\nMamdani built an enthusiastic following among young people and progressives with his upbeat and populist campaign, which he focused on making the nation's largest city more affordable. He vowed to eliminate fares on city buses, freeze rents and offer universal child care, and to seek higher taxes on the wealthiest to pay for his programs.\n\nSupporters cheered his victory as a validation of a bold new direction for a party that has struggled to chart one after its deflating presidential loss in 2024.\n\n“Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is paving the way for what should be the future of the Democratic Party—young, bold leaders who understand the affordability crisis in our country and have concrete plans to lower our cost of living,\" Katie Bethell, executive director of MoveOn Political Action, said in a statement.\n\nBut Mamdani's identification as a \"democratic socialist\" and his criticism of Israel also set off fierce opposition during the campaign. His left-wing politics agitated Republicans so much that some — up to and including President Donald Trump — urged GOP voters to pass over their party's nominee and vote for the more centrist Democrat Cuomo as the only candidate who could beat Mamdani.\n\nCuomo, who was governor for 10 years before resigning in 2021 while facing sexual harassment allegations, played up the frontrunner's thin resume and called his plans unrealistic to gain ground with voters and narrow Mamdani's polling lead. But he came up short.\n\nMore: See results from Election Day 2025 in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties\n\nIn his post-election speech, Cuomo touted his strong showing as an independent candidate and the varied support he won across the spectrum from Democratic, Republican and independent voters. He took shots at the victor but also offered his congratulations and scolded his supporters as they booed Mamdani.\n\nSliwa, a talk-radio host best known as the founder of the Guardian Angels vigilante group, indignantly resisted calls to exit the race in its final weeks in order to consolidate opposition behind Cuomo. Sliwa also ran for mayor in 2021 and lost then to Eric Adams — the scandal-tarred Democrat who dropped his own independent run for re-election and wound up backing Cuomo.\n\nMamdani win's impact on 2026 elections for governor, U.S. House\n\nMamdani's victory is expected to play a role in 2026 elections for governor and for key suburban House seats in New York. Republicans — whose party suffered crushing defeats in New Jersey and Virginia governor's races on Tuesday and faces headwinds in midterm elections — are eager to cast the incoming mayor as a symbol of left-wing extremism and brandish it against Democrat candidates.\n\n\"Zohran Mamdani is now the face of the Democratic Party,\" Ed Cox, New York's Republican Party chairman, said in a statement. \"Americans must assume that any Democrat who does not explicitly say otherwise stands with Mamdani and his support of Islamic terrorism, Communism, and defunding the police.\"\n\nHe vowed that Gov. Kathy Hochul — who endorsed Mamdani while other top New York Democrats held back support — will \"answer to voters for her support of this lunacy next November.\"\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, the 11-year congresswoman who represents northeast New York and is weighing a 2026 run for governor, declared that \"New York City has now fallen to a pro-Hamas, Defund the Police, Tax Hiking, Antisemite Jihadist Communist.\"\n\n\"And instead of standing up for hardworking New York families,\" Stefanik said, \"Kathy Hochul proved once again that she is truly the Worst Governor in America with her desperate endorsement of Commie Mamdani.\"\n\nHochul, who had joined Mamdani at a recent campaign rally in Queens but was not at his victory party, posted her congratulations on X.\n\n\"Just spoke to Mayor-Elect @ZohranKMamdani and told him I’m looking forward to working together to make our city more affordable and livable,\" she wrote. \"Congratulations to him and to every New Yorker who made their voice heard in one of the city’s highest-turnout elections on record.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, a Rockland County Republican facing a tough re-election race next year, posted his critique of Mamdani on X: \"Freezing rents. Banning private property. Seizing the means of production. Defunding police. Shutting down prisons. Legalizing prostitution. And hiking taxes by $9 BILLION — in the financial capital of the world. Good luck selling that in the suburbs next year.\"\n\nBoth of New York's Democratic U.S. senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, had withheld endorsements of Mamdani.\n\nGillibrand said after the election that she called Mamdani to congratulate him and plans to work with him to \"address the affordability crisis and lower costs, ensure New York is safe for all, and protect our fundamental rights.\"\n\n\"New York voters have fairly and freely chosen their next mayor, and the results of this election should not draw the ire of the president or the federal government,\" Gillibrand said, referring to President Donald Trump's public threats to withhold New York City's federal funding. \"I stand ready to defend New York against any and all of the retaliation from the Trump administration.\"\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, who also made no endorsement for the general election, congratulated Mamdani in an X Post, saying: \"I’m wishing you success as you work to transform the passion of your campaign into building a better, fairer, more affordable New York.\"\n\nChris McKenna covers government and politics for The Journal News and USA Today Network.

Andrew Cuomo in the June primary.\n\nThe campaign touted 3 million doors knocked and 90,000 volunteers.\n\nFrom the start, Mamdani was seemingly everywhere, and posting about it.\n\nNEW YORK − Some point to his viral social media clips. Others cite his Obama-esque profile, giving young voters something to believe in. Maybe it’s just his dimples.\n\nZohran Mamdani shocked the political and business establishment by winning the Nov. 4 New York City mayoral election as a democratic socialist, leading many to wonder how it happened.\n\nIn interviews with allies, strategists and observers, Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman from Queens, ran a disciplined campaign across all five boroughs, flanked by an unusually large army of volunteers for a municipal race.\n\nHis winning message offered easily understood ideas for cutting the cost of living in the notoriously expensive city and his universal outreach helped win over skeptical constituencies.\n\nIt's a dramatic shift from moderate Mayor Eric Adams, who won just four years ago, and a flashback to Adams' progressive predecessor, Bill de Blasio, who ran on addressing economic inequality.\n\n“New York is accustomed to a pendulum swing,” Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University and co-host of the politics podcast “FAQ NYC,” told USA TODAY.\n\n“This is the time to be bold,\" Greer said. \"This is the time to try something new, because, clearly, whatever we have been doing is not working, right?”\n\n'Relentless' campaign on affordability\n\nLeading up to the June Democratic primary, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, from a storied Democratic dynasty, was the prohibitive favorite to replace Adams, whose tenure had become mired in corruption scandals.\n\nBut like de Blasio did 12 years earlier, Mamdani identified the growing crisis of unaffordability as the city's most pressing problem and grabbed attention − especially from the young and online − by promising to address it.\n\nHousing and child care costs have been rising, contributing to inflation in the New York metropolitan area that outpaces the national average, Gothamist reported. The United Way of New York City found costs have increased 131% across the boroughs since 2000, while incomes have only risen 71%.\n\nState Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, the Brooklyn Democratic Party boss who endorsed Cuomo in the primary, said Mamdani was a \"relentless\" and \"principled\" campaigner on cost-of-living issues.\n\n“Zohran won on an unapologetic working-class agenda,” said Gustavo Gordillo, co-chair of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America, which counts Mamdani as a member. “He showed that, by choosing a side between the billionaire class and the working class, you can create a broad coalition of working-class voters.”\n\nThe reality is more mixed. In the primary, Mamdani won in many upper-middle-class areas and gentrifying neighborhoods while Cuomo carried working-class Black, Latino and White areas. Mamdani, who will be the first Muslim mayor and first South Asian mayor of New York, did better among those communities.\n\nAs the Democratic nominee, however, analyses by the New York Times and the nonprofit news outlet The CITY found that Mamdani won in most lower- and middle-income precincts on Nov. 4. He had a strong showing across most income levels.\n\nIn the general election, Mamdani also won segments of the traditional Democratic base, including Black and Latino neighborhoods, that he had lost to former Cuomo in the June primary, when he defeated Cuomo in a remarkable upset.\n\nShowing up around town\n\nFrom the start, Mamdani was seemingly everywhere, and posting about it.\n\n“He wasn’t cautious,” Democratic strategist Trip Yang said. “He continued doing the things that made him good.”\n\nAfter Trump won in 2024, Mamdani interviewed New Yorkers in the Bronx and Queens who voted for the president because of the cost of groceries, then told them he was running for mayor. During the primary, he walked the length of Manhattan. He showed up to a Wu-Tang Clan concert in July at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThat continued into the general election. The Thursday night before Election Day, he canvassed taxi drivers at LaGuardia Airport, before eating biryani with them in Jackson Heights, Queens. Hours later, for jummah congregational prayer, his campaign canvassed 210 of the city’s roughly 300 mosques, according to Hamaad Najam, a campaign spokesperson. He later showed up at Brooklyn clubs and in the nose bleeds at a New York Knicks game next to Bronx-native comedian \"The Kid Mero,\" who has supported Mamdani.\n\nCuomo, by contrast, sat courtside with Mayor Adams at the Knicks' opening night. Cuomo appeared briefly at events, as if he were still in the governor's mansion, despite resigning in 2021 due to sexual harassment scandals. He often came by car, sometimes parked illegally in a city where many don't even have driver's licenses.\n\nGrassroots organizing early\n\nMamdani was relatively unknown when he launched his campaign to lead the nation's largest city. The third-term state legislator had polled only 1% in a crowded field.\n\nHis outreach began right after he announced his candidacy in October 2024, according to Jagpreet Singh, political director at DRUM Beats, an organization that engages South Asian and Indo-Caribbean New Yorkers. Mamdani had established roots in South Asian and Muslim communities, including from work at Chhaya Community Development Corp., a Queens nonprofit, where he was a foreclosure prevention counselor and Singh worked on tenants' rights.\n\nThe campaign started early outside of Hindu temples, mosques and weekly street and cultural events, Singh said. By the time other candidates visited, Mamdani had already amassed support. His campaign energized Muslim and South Asian New Yorkers to vote.\n\nMamdani didn’t just focus on his identity as a Muslim born in Uganda to parents of Indian descent. He focused on his signature three-part platform that people could easily recite or write down, both lovingly and in spite: a rent freeze, free buses and universal child care. (That he can only freeze the rent in rent-stabilized apartments, which are less than half of those in the city, seems not to have dampened the enthusiasm of his supporters in market-rate rentals.)\n\n“He had a clear, compelling message,” Ross Barkan, a political analyst whose 2018 state Senate campaign Mamdani managed, previously told USA TODAY. “People point to his social media and his natural charisma − and I think that all matters − but it was an affordability message. It was very obviously where he stood from day one.”\n\nWhile TikTok and Instagram verticals certainly helped Mamdani connect with young people, he also got millennial and Gen Z voters to show up in real life. The campaign touted 3 million doors knocked and 90,000 volunteers. They quickly fundraised to qualify for the city’s matching funds program, whereby candidates reach a certain fundraising threshold that then gets matched by public dollars. His campaign told supporters to stop donating money and start donating time.\n\nMamdani previously told USA TODAY, \"Younger voters are, in many ways, at the heart of this campaign, and where we are in this moment.\"\n\nWinning over the establishment\n\nThe night Mamdani won the June 24 primary, Bichotte Hermelyn, the Brooklyn assemblywoman, endorsed him.\n\nMamdani, she said, campaigned on \"regular issues that made people come out, knock on doors, make phone calls, volunteer and invest. And because of that, unlike the other candidates, he didn't need to be tied to billionaires or millionaires. Everything was grassroots.”\n\nLater, Gov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate facing reelection in 2026, endorsed Mamdani in September, appearing with him at a 10,000-person rally in Queens in October.\n\nOthers were more reluctant, but Mamdani gradually won over many of them. He held meetings with business leaders to ease the concerns of wary moderates.\n\nIn 2020, he called to “#defundtheNYPD\" and said the agency was \"racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.\" He apologized in October to the rank-and-file, preventing that attack line from taking hold, Yang said. When a Nevada man killed Officer Didarul Islam in a Midtown Manhattan mass shooting in July, Mamdani flew back from his wedding in Uganda to console Islam’s grieving family in the Bronx.\n\nHe also vowed to keep current Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch in charge of the NYPD. Tisch is a billionaire heiress whose father donated heavily to former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Republican. He has said he wouldn't cut the police budget and would keep staffing levels the same.\n\nAfter these signals, he gradually picked up the backing of Democratic stalwarts such as Rep. Adriano Espaillat, the first Dominican American in Congress, who in the primary backed Cuomo, and a late endorsement from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the powerful Brooklyn Democrat.\n\nMamdani worked with Bichotte Hermelyn and other Black city leaders to meet with voters, including frequent church stops in the city's working-class outer boroughs.\n\nStaying on-message, reaching out to everyone\n\nMamdani is a long-time activist for Palestinian rights, who has called for boycotting Israel and refers to its occupation of Gaza and the West Bank as \"apartheid.\"\n\nBut running for a municipal job, Mamdani mostly focused on local issues. At one debate, candidates were asked where they'd visit as mayor. A plurality responded Israel. Mamdani said he'd stay in the city. When specifically pressed about why not Israel, he said he'd visit Jewish New Yorkers where they were.\n\nMamdani reached out to the city's diverse Jewish communities. He had difficult conversations with reform congregations in Brooklyn, met with Hasidic leaders, and had four rabbis speak in support of his candidacy.\n\nIt was a stark contrast to Cuomo, who also relied on his connections in Jewish communities but did little outreach to Muslims.\n\nPolls found that Mamdani lost nearly two-thirds of Jewish voters to Cuomo, who had high support in Orthodox voting blocs.\n\nBut Mamdani's outreach to the Jewish community may still have paid some dividends, as he easily carried progressive neighborhoods like Brooklyn's Park Slope with large Jewish populations.\n\nComptroller Brad Lander, the city's highest-ranking Jewish official who formerly represented Park Slope on the City Council, disagrees with Mamdani on some issues around Israel, but he pivotally cross-endorsed Mamdani in the June primary and campaigned for him in the general election.\n\n“New Yorkers love this city,\" he said, \"but they can’t afford to stay here.”\n\nNow it's up to Mamdani to fix it, or the pendulum may swing back again.\n\nEduardo Cuevas is based in New York City.

Then we'll see ...", "text": "Oct. 17, 2025, 5:07 a.m. ET\n\nI love to visit New York City. It's a thriving metropolis that boasts delicious food, world-class entertainment and iconic landmarks. But I'd never want to live there. It's expensive and dirty, and New Yorkers have a history of electing Democratic mayors.\n\nNow, New Yorkers have discovered a zeal for Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democrat socialist, showing a penchant for leaning left even more.\n\nIt's a mistake to prop up socialism as a solution to New Yorkers' affordability problems. But the more I’ve seen of Mamdani’s campaign, the more I think a full-throated case for why New Yorkers should vote him in as mayor may be in order.\n\nMamdani is already a media darling, but he lacks real-world experience\n\nI want New Yorkers to vote for Mamdani to be the dummy test for socialism because he's already captured the mainstream media, even though he has a résumé thinner than a Broadway playbill.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nMamdani was elected to the New York State Assembly in 2020, but he's had little legislative success. He's only been the primary sponsor of three window-dressing bills that passed.\n\nThis doesn't matter to the press. In 2021, he made Prospect magazine's list of \"The world’s top 50 thinkers.\" The New York Times Magazine published glowing praise of the front-runner in the mayoral race: \"Inside the Improbable, Audacious and (So Far) Unstoppable Rise of Zohran Mamdani,\" an Oct. 14 headline for the feature reads. In the September Vanity Fair cover story headlined \"The Legend of Zohran,\" the writer praised him as having \"Kennedy-like charisma.\"\n\nNew Yorkers have picked up on this glowing media attention. Whether they have influenced the coverage, or the coverage has influenced them, they're wildly in Mamdani's favor. In a Quinnipiac University poll published Oct. 9, Mamdani led former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, now running for mayor as an independent. Among Mamdani's likely voters, 90% say they are somewhat or very enthusiastic about him.\n\nIt's time this enthusiasm be tested in a real-world scenario.\n\nIf New Yorkers want Mamdani, they can have him\n\nIt's clear New Yorkers want Mamdani. He should win so voters can see if the policies he advocates play out in real life as well as they expect. I'm not one to play devil's advocate with policy − the risk/reward ratio is way off − but in this case, I think I agree with what U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Vanity Fair in that same cover story.\n\n“I kind of like Mamdani winning,” Bessent said, \"because the worst thing in a way would be when Cuomo comes back in, you just keep losing a little bit of altitude for four or eight more years, and they kind of hold it together, and more people leave. So if you could just say, ‘Okay, he’s a shock to the system, and there’s a chance you can come back from it.’ ”\n\nHe's basically saying New Yorkers should give Mamdani a go. They'll see how his policies fail. They're tough enough to handle it (or not), and it's possible things will get so bad, they'll have to make a 180-degree turn toward conservatism to right things again.\n\nEverything Mamdani has said he would do for New Yorkers, if elected, confirms this thesis. The democratic socialist has said that he'd raise taxes on millionaires, and he has also pushed for raising the minimum wage, freezing rent, providing free public transportation and establishing city-run grocery stores.\n\nThere are other questionable issues, too. In a recent interview with Fox News' Martha MacCallum, Mamdani issued a broad apology to the New York Police Department for comments he made in 2020, calling them a “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.”\n\nAn apology is good, but the timing raises questions about Mamdani's authenticity. The aspiring mayor has also criticized Israel's role in the Gaza war and says it's too early to give President Donald Trump credit for the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.\n\nHere's the bottom line: No matter how good Mamdani's ideas sound on paper, socialist policies in practice are always a colossal failure. History is our guide here. New Yorkers could start with the collapse of the Soviet Union and end with the decline of Venezuela.\n\nWhy would New York be any different? Perhaps New Yorkers think so because they could elect a socialist mayor but still be insulated within the free market system and the democratic republic of the state and country. Perhaps it's because they're gritty and scrappy, the epitome of the American spirit.\n\nBecause New Yorkers often embody this spirit, I guess that's why I'm surprised to see them support a politician whose ideas are the opposite of America's bedrock: capitalism. Often, socialists don't see this irony.\n\nIn a 2025 Cato/YouGov survey, 62% of Americans under 30 said they \"feel favorable toward socialism,\" and yet 81% of all respondents said they can't afford to pay more taxes next year. Who wants to tell them that's how all of Mamdani's \"free\" stuff gets paid for? (Even raising corporate taxes, which is one of the ways Mamdani plans on paying for his \"free\" transportation, will eventually result in increased costs for consumers.)\n\nRegardless of how charming Mamdani is − and he is, I'll give him that − his plans will fail. Of all Americans, New Yorkers perhaps can own up to this mistake, dust themselves off and vote differently next time. If we're going to test out socialism, might as well let them get it over with.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY. She lives in Texas with her four kids.

Dhoom Machale Dhoom,” the song goes, which loosely translates to “make some noise, have some fun.” The tune he closed out to is the title song from the 2004 Hindi movie “Dhoom.”\n\nMoments earlier, Mamdani had a high-octane message for Donald Trump: “Since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up.”\n\nWas the one-time aspiring rapper who became a state assemblyman urging the president to pay attention or flaunting the generational power shift? Maybe both.\n\nAt 34, Mamdani will be the youngest New York mayor in more than a century. Trump, a 79-year-old Queens native, is the oldest person elected to be commander-in-chief.\n\nAfter the speech, as the fast-paced \"Dhoom\" song played, Mamdani's wife, Rama Duwaji, the Gen Z child of Syrian immigrants, who grew up in Dallas and Dubai, joined him on stage. The crowd hooted and cheered.\n\nIn his speech, he had referred to Duwaji as “hayati” or “my life” in Arabic.\n\nHe also quoted India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s famous \"Tryst with Destiny\" speech delivered in the Constituent Assembly on the eve of India’s independence on August 14, 1947: \"A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.\"\n\nMamdani was born in Uganda, moved to New York City at the age of 7, and took frequent trips to India. He's fluent in Hindi and Spanish.\n\nHis campaign ads featured him wearing kurtas, Indian tunics. His Instagram posts and speeches include words in Arabic, Spanish and Hindi. Before his bid for mayor, Mamdani represented Queens, a borough where more than 140 languages are spoken.\n\n“Release your client list, habibi,” he said in one campaign ad, asking his opponent and \"habibi\" (friend, dude, darling), Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, to disclose his business dealings.\n\nHe hopped into Arabic again after his resounding victory against Cuomo and Republican contender Curtis Sliwa Tuesday night.\n\nHe told voters: “You showed that when politics speaks to you without condescension, we can usher in a new era of leadership. We will fight for you, because we are you. Or, as we say on Steinway, ana minkum wa alaikum.”\n\nSteinway Street in the “Little Egypt” section of Astoria, Queens is home to a large Muslim community. The Arabic phrase, which translates to something along the lines of \"we are of you and you are of us.\"\n\nThen he offered a nod to the cultural diversity of New York City's residents.\n\n\"Thank you to those so often forgotten by the politics of our city, who made this movement their own.

Congressional Republicans even seem ready to blame him for the monthlong government shutdown they have no desire to end.\n\n“The Democratic Party has changed, Mamdani is now running the party,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, said during an Oct. 29 news conference about the government shutdown. “That party has changed. The American people still have the same needs.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Republicans have fearmongered about Mamdani. They are clearly threatened by the 34-year-old democratic socialist and are fearful of what New York City will become if he’s elected mayor. My fear, however, is that these attacks are just beginning and will only get worse if Mamdani does prevail on Nov. 4.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nRepublicans love to attack Mamdani – including Trump\n\nSince Mamdani became the Democratic nominee, Republicans have been lobbing attacks at the state assemblyman who seems poised to become the next mayor of New York City. Members of the GOP have demanded that President Donald Trump’s administration consider deporting Mamdani, while others have made horrific comments about his Muslim identity.\n\nTrump has also made multiple comments about Mamdani since the primary election, including falsely labeling the nominee a “communist” and claiming that he is “here illegally.” Shortly after the primary election in June, the president threatened to arrest Mamdani.\n\nRecently, Trump vowed to send in the National Guard and withhold federal funds from New York City if Mamdani were elected, claiming, “We have a communist ... doesn't know a thing, probably never worked a day in his life, and he sort of caught on.”\n\nIt’s wild to me that Republican leaders suddenly care so much about the fate of New York City, given how much they love to complain about the Democratic stronghold. What worries me is that Republicans are so hellbent on this narrative of the city’s destruction that Mamdani’s potential election victory will lead Trump to attack the city for years to come.\n\nDemocrats are fearmongering, too – and refusing to endorse Mamdani\n\nOf course, I’m not the only one worried about this. Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo has said as much on the campaign trail, arguing that this is the reason that he, a scandal-ridden former governor of New York, should be the one to take over city hall.\n\n“If Mamdani wins, you are going to see Trump come in here and take over New York City,” Cuomo told podcast host Stephen A. Smith on Oct. 29. “You mark my words.”\n\nI don’t buy that. Cuomo is trying to stoke fears among New Yorkers just as much as the Republicans are – and Democrats should be wary of listening to him.\n\nSince Trump’s reelection, several Democratic elected officials have flirted with right-wing talking points instead of standing strong in their beliefs.\n\nRep. Tom Suozzi, D-New York, said after the election that Democrats lost votes for “pandering to the far left,” throwing trans people under the bus in the process. Suozzi, who represents part of Long Island, also recently chose to buck the party and endorsed Cuomo, declaring himself “a democratic capitalist, not a democratic socialist.”\n\nOther Democrats are showing their spinelessness by refraining from commenting on the mayoral race altogether. Both New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have failed to endorse Mamdani, signaling their discomfort with someone as far left as Mamdani becoming a leader in the party.\n\nIf Mamdani does win, he’s going to need support from his fellow Democrats when Trump inevitably tries to go after New York City. It’s time for longtime members of the party to stand with him, instead of letting him be relentlessly attacked by the president of the United States and his acolytes. It’s time for Democrats to take a stand in support of Mamdani, especially since he is likely to be the person fielding the most attacks from Trump in the coming years.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter: @sara__pequeno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/10/23/mamdani-won-nyc-mayoral-debate-inexperience/86843167007/", "title": "Mamdani's NYC mayoral debate brought us back down to earth ...", "text": "Oct. 23, 2025, 4:31 a.m. ET\n\nThe final New York City mayoral debate was Zohran Mamdani’s to lose. The Democratic nominee had a great first debate, is polling ahead of independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa and is widely considered to be the future mayor of New York City.\n\nYet Mamdani, a state legislator, failed to answer some important questions in the Oct. 22 debate on ballot measures and public schooling, underscoring concerns about his experience level. It wasn’t that he performed poorly; he just wasn’t as strong as I had hoped he’d be. Despite this, I still believe he’s the best candidate in the race.\n\nNo, Mamdani is not as experienced as Cuomo. But we cannot ignore that the former governor’s “experience” as a politician includes him leaving office after being accused of sexual harassment by 13 women and potentially undercounting nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mamdani also has more political experience than Sliwa, who has never held public office and was basically just onstage to deliver a good joke every now and then.\n\nZohran Mamdani wants to follow the law\n\nI’d go so far as to say Mamdani isn’t going to change the city as much as fearmongering centrist Democrats and Republicans say he will. In fact, Cuomo compared Mamdani to former Mayor Bill de Blasio, asserting that the state assemblyman has no new ideas – and that the ideas he does have are too bold.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nDespite this mixed messaging, it’s clear that Mamdani is not the radical everyone wants to paint him as. For example, The New York Times recently reported that Mamdani would allow Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to continue serving in her role if he were to be elected, something he confirmed on the debate stage.\n\nMamdani is also the only candidate who said he would follow the law and close Rikers Island prison. He supports the state’s Raise the Age law, which changed the age that a child can be prosecuted as an adult to 18 in criminal cases, and wants to strengthen the city’s law on carbon emissions.\n\nOverall, I’m confused at how Mamdani’s opponents can say both of these things at the same time. He’s either got no new ideas or too many new ideas – but it can’t be both.\n\nMamdani is charming, but green\n\nThe essence of the debate was captured about 30 minutes in, when Cuomo and Sliwa both turned to Mamdani and united in heckling the Democratic nominee over ballot measures regarding housing. Throughout the jeers, Mamdani kept a smile on his face – even as he said he didn’t have a firm position on the measures.\n\nConsidering how close we are to Election Day, Mamdani’s decision not to weigh in either way on the ballot measures (which are opposed by the City Council but supported by current Mayor Eric Adams) was just one instance where the candidate looked like a newcomer to the political scene.\n\nThe other instance was when asked about his plan for New York City public schools. He does not have a full platform for how he wants to run the Department of Education, and says he is “opposed to mayoral control” of the school system.\n\nI’m concerned about Mamdani’s lack of an answer to the ballot initiative question, but I’m more concerned about what would happen if Cuomo were elected mayor of New York City. The former goveror is a decidedly corrupt character; he’s also the candidate who spent the least amount of time talking about making New York affordable for the working class. Even if he had a better debate night than anticipated, it does not change these facts.\n\nIf anything, this debate made me less starry-eyed about the prospect of Mamdani’s big plans and helped me stay grounded. It does seem unlikely that he will accomplish all his campaign promises as mayor, but the fact that he has even dared to be so bold is a hopeful sign for this progressive.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter:@sara__pequeno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/11/04/nyc-mayor-election-mamdani-vs-cuomo-results/86572353007/", "title": "Mamdani defeats Cuomo in NYC mayor's race: Recap", "text": "Nov. 4, 2025 Updated Nov. 7, 2025, 1:05 p.m. ET\n\n\"We are breathing in the air of a city that has been reborn,” Zohran Mamdani told a rapturous crowd of supporters after Andrew Cuomo conceded.\n\nMamdani offered voters unabashedly left-leaning proposals including a rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments, free buses and universal child care, paid for by taxes on the city’s wealthiest.\n\nMamdani, who was born in Uganda, will become the city's first Muslim mayor and its first mayor of Asian descent.\n\n\"This was a change election,\" political consultant Suri Kasirer told USA TODAY, noting record voter turnout and Mamdani's energized grass roots campaign.\n\nNEW YORK − Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who shot to stardom and shook up Democratic politics, has won the race for mayor of New York City.\n\nThe race was called for Mamdani around 9:30 p.m. on Nov. 4, and his chief opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, later conceded in a combative speech to supporters.\n\nBefore a roaring crowd at the Brooklyn Paramount theater, Mamdani thanked young New Yorkers for believing \"that the promise of a better future is not a relic of the past\" in a speech that shouted out \"Yemeni cab drivers and Mexican abuelas\" among the workers who deliver the city's packages, staff its warehouses and sweat in its kitchens.\n\n“We are breathing in the air of a city that has been reborn,” he said.\n\n'We sent a message.' Five takeaways from Democrats' 2025 elections sweep\n\n\"I wish Andrew Cuomo only the best in private life,\" Mamdani said. “But let tonight be the final time I utter his name as we turn the page on politics that abandons the many and answers only to the few.”\n\nMamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens, was at 1% in the polls when he launched an upstart campaign focused on the cost of living. He offered unabashedly left-leaning proposals including a rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments, free buses and universal child care, paid for by taxes on the city’s wealthiest. Several of the city's billionaires donated millions of dollars on attack ads against him.\n\nCuomo, the 67-year-old inheritor of a storied New York political name, was considered unbeatable until Mamdani, 34, won an upset in the Democratic primary in June.\n\nThe general election campaign, which Cuomo contested as an independent, was marked by fighting over Mamdani’s proposals and his past criticisms of Israel and the New York Police Department.\n\nIn addition to some fellow Democrats objecting to him, Mamdani drew the ire of President Donald Trump, a Queens native, and other Republicans who have attacked Mamdani − a Ugandan immigrant and a Muslim − with incendiary allegations that he supports terrorism. Some of those attacks were echoed by Cuomo, who Trump endorsed.\n\n\"This was a change election,\" political consultant Suri Kasirer told USA TODAY, noting record voter turnout and Mamdani's grass roots campaign.\n\nWhen Mamdani replaces embattled incumbent Mayor Eric Adams on Jan. 1, he will have to navigate threats by the Trump administration to pull federal funds from New York and convince state lawmakers to approve his plans for taxing and spending.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nMamdani dares Trump\n\nZohran Mamdani dared President Donald Trump to keep going after him in a combative speech after his Nov. 4 New York City mayoral election victory.\n\nMamdani, the subject of months of attacks from the president, called Trump out by name as the democratic socialist hailed a “mandate for change” with his victory.\n\n“If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,” Mamdani, 34, said. “And if there is any way to defeat a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.”\n\nHe added: “This is not only how we stop Trump ‒ it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.”\n\nTrump had endorsed Mamdani's chief opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and threatened to withhold federal funds from New York if the young democratic socialist was elected.\n\nAfter the race was called for Mamdani, Trump left a four-word post on Truth Social: \"…AND SO IT BEGINS!\"\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Eduardo Cuevas\n\nBad Bunny and the Black Eyes Peas show a younger New York choosing the mayor\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's election night victory party reflected the new coalition that has brought him to power. A racially diverse − but decidedly young-skewing − filled the Paramount Theater in Brooklyn.\n\nLocated on the border of the rapidly developing Downtown Brooklyn and the once majority-Black, now heavily gentrified Fort Greene neighborhood, the 2,700-capacity venue is in one of the areas where progressive young professionals drove Mamdani to victory.\n\nAs election results trickled in, he 34-year-old democratic socialist's supporters began filling the dance floor in front of a DJ playing remixes of Bad Bunny’s “Nueva Yol,” the Black Eyed Peas, classic New York hip hop like 50 Cent’s \"Many Men,” old R&B, and Afro-beats.\n\nThe crowd also sang along to English singer Natasha Bedingfield’s early-aughts “Unwritten,\" and hear bhangra blasting from the speakers.\n\n--Eduardo Cuevas and Ben Adler\n\nTears and a vision for New York City\n\nShortly after Zohran Mamdani exited the stage with his wife, mother and father, the crowd lingered as Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s Motown ballad, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” played.\n\nRebuking Trump, California passes Prop 50 to redistrict in favor of Democrats\n\nTeary-eyed, Brooklyn resident Katie Deray, 37, wore a blue “Iranians for Zohran” tee, in English and Farsi. She had black bows in her hair with “Z” stickers on them.\n\nAs the daughter of an Iranian immigrant, she said Mamdani was “so transparent and unapologetically himself” during the campaign,, even as he faced what he called racist and Islamophobic attacks. “It’s a beautiful thing,” she said.\n\nDeray, a social worker, came to support Mamdani's plans for a “Department of Community Safety,” to help respond to certain emergency calls as an alternative to the NYPD. She said some voters were concerned about 34-year-old Mamdani's age, she saw it as an asset that would help him think differently.\n\nMamdani, she said, wasn’t “encumbered by the mechanisms of the political structure that are inevitable, to a degree,” she said.\n\n-- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMamdani says New Yorkers delivered a ‘mandate for change’\n\nMamdani hailed his victory as a “mandate for change” after winning New York City’s mayoral election with more than 50% of the vote.\n\n“You have delivered a mandate for a new kind of politics, a mandate for a city we can afford and a mandate for a government that delivers exactly that,” the 34-year-old democratic socialist said in his remarks.\n\nMamdani kicked off his election speech by quoting the early 20th century United States labor leader Eugene V. Debs, the founder of the Socialist Party of America more than a century ago.\n\n\"As Eugene Debs once said, I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity,” Mamdani said.\n\nMamdani took a jab at his chief election opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who finished about 9 percentage points behind Mamdani.\n\n\"My friends, we have toppled a political dynasty,\" he said. \"I wish Andrew Cuomo the best in private life.

Her brother worked on Mamdani’s campaigns, including when he ran for state Assembly and won in 2020.\n\nThe importance of Mamdani as the first Muslim and South Asian mayor, and someone who immigrated to the country as a child, wasn’t lost on Merchant, who is a second-generation American.\n\n“It’s amazing seeing someone with that identity bringing an entire city of diverse communities together,” said Merchant, who works in policy at a nonprofit.\n\nMamdani, she said, “has embraced New York City as his own and actually contributed meaningfully to it. I’m excited to see what doors he can open for others.”\n\n-- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nLikely GOP candidate for governor puts Mamdani at center of 2026 race\n\nGOP U.S. representative and potential candidate for governor, Elise Stefanik, said in a statement that the \"only way to save our great state and provide a check on this insanity is to elect a Republican Governor in 2026.\n\nStefanik said that under Gov. Kathy Hochul’s \"weak catastrophic leadership, New York City has now fallen to a pro-Hamas, Defund the Police, Tax Hiking, Antisemite Jihadist Communist.\"\n\nMamdani is a democratic socialist, not a communist, and he denies accusations that he is antisemitic or supports Islamist violence, calling such claims Islamophobic.\n\nStefanik has teased a race for governor for months, but has said she would not make an announcement about her decision until after the 2025 election.\n\n--Sarah D.

As the city’s second Black mayor, Adams − a former police officer seen as a political moderate − was considered by some to be the future of the Democratic Party before scandals rocked his administration.\n\nThis Election Day, video showed Adams, now 65, walking alone in untucked white dress shirt with his hands in his pockets to his polling place at P.S. 81 in Brooklyn. His security flanked him crossing the street.\n\nAfter facing federal corruption charges that the Trump Justice Department later dropped, Adams skipped the June Democratic primary and ran as an independent before ending his long-shot reelection bid in September. He later endorsed Cuomo − whom he once called “a snake and a liar” − against Mamdani, the Democratic nominee.\n\nAdams' name remains on the ballot, on an independent line. Fabien Levy, Adams' spokesperson, said he supported Cuomo.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nSchumer mum on who he voted for\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the senior senator from New York, declined to say who he voted for.\n\nWhen asked at a press conference on Capitol Hill whether he voted for the Democratic candidate, Mamdani, or for Cuomo, the former Democratic governor running as an independent, Schumer simply said he voted.\n\n\"Look, I voted and I look forward to working with the next mayor to help New York City,” Schumer said.\n\n–Rebecca Morin\n\nWho do the city’s past (living) mayors support? Split, just like they are about baseball.\n\nNew York’s former mayors are as divided about the race to lead City Hall as they are about which baseball team to back. Here's where the living former mayors and the current hizzoner stand on the election and baseball.\n\nNone of the living former mayors or mayoral hopefuls’ teams made it to this year's World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who originated in Brooklyn, won after midnight early Sunday morning, Nov. 2.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhite House calls Mamdani ‘irresponsible’ over bomb-threat allegations\n\nAfter Mamdani linked Trump to bomb threats at New Jersey polling places, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the candidate “irresponsible.”\n\nMamdani called the bomb threats part of voter intimidation like Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud.\n\n“I think they are completely irresponsible and they are based on zero evidence,” Leavitt told reporters Tuesday at the White House.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nEarly voting saw record turnout\n\nIn arguably the buzziest mayoral race in New York history, New Yorkers have recorded the highest turnout in the city's history in the general election.\n\nFinal New York City Board of Elections tallies showed over 735,000 check-ins in the early voting period from Oct. 25 to Nov. 2. In 2021, the last time the city elected its mayor, more than 169,000 people cast their ballots during early voting, four times less than in 2025.\n\nSunday, Nov. 2 − the final day for New Yorkers to cast their ballots in early voting before the Nov. 4 election − marked the highest early voting day in New York City history, elections officials announced in a Monday news release.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas and Jay Stahl\n\nWhat is a democratic socialist?\n\nLike Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Mamdani identifies as a democratic socialist. And like Ocasio-Cortez, he belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nDemocratic socialists believe that the government and economy should be run for the benefit of the public rather than private profit. They typically favor an enhanced social safety net such as universal health insurance provided by the government and paid for with higher taxes on the rich.\n\nUnlike communism and other authoritarian systems of government, democratic socialists believe in democracy. Sanders has pointed to the social democracies in Scandinavia as models he would emulate in the United States.\n\n−Ben Adler\n\nVoters on both sides focused on cost of living\n\nMamdani reshaped the New York City mayoral race by focusing on cost of living in the notoriously expensive city.\n\nInwood resident Gisselee Rivera, 20, voted for Mamdani, citing cost of living as the top issue for her and her parents. She works in an after-school program for kids, and she thought Mamdani's proposed rent freeze would help her family. She said she noticed Mamdani talking to people and businesses across different neighborhoods on social media, and he also campaigned heavily in her neighborhood during the primary.\n\n“It gives you a different idea of how the actual neighborhood is working,” Rivera said.\n\nBronx resident Zoila Cruz, 59, had a more pessimistic view and said she was leaning toward voting for Cuomo. Cruz had two jobs as a home attendant, but recently lost work in one job and said she struggles to keep up with rising expenses.\n\n“Every day is worse,” she said in Spanish. “The economy, the cost of living, the rent.”\n\nCruz wasn't confident that Cuomo could improve things, but she sided with him more than the others. She thought Mamdani’s proposal for free buses was unrealistic. “Es una locura, verdad, mi amor?” Cruz said. It’s crazy, right, my love?\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nIn Manhattan Latino hub, voters divided\n\nIn northern Manhattan, which has the highest concentration of Dominicans in the United States, voters appeared split between Mamdani’s vision and Cuomo’s experience. The area is represented by Democratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat, the first Dominican in Congress, who has backed Mamdani in the general election after endorsing Cuomo in the primary. The area swung to Mamdani in the primary.\n\n“I’m going to vote for the youth and something new,” Jose Rodriguez, 72, a retiree, said in Spanish outside of the Washington Heights Academy in the Inwood neighborhood on a windy Election Day morning. His family encouraged him to vote for Mamdani. Rodriguez said he was most concerned about public safety and homelessness, and thought Mamdani could make a change as opposed to Cuomo, who he said represented the old political class.\n\nCell phone vendor Hector Ferreira, 49, planned to cast his vote for Cuomo. Mamdani was too liberal and New York had already gone too left, Ferreira said in Spanish. Ferreira was in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic capital, during the primary and didn’t vote then. But Cuomo, he said, “has the experience that New York City needs right now to fight crime and to improve quality of life.”\n\nA year ago, Ferreira voted for President Donald Trump to fix the economy, which Ferreira blamed on former President Joe Biden. Inwood, like many working-class Latino communities, voted in record numbers for Trump. Mamdani has tried to bring back these voters to Democrats, while Cuomo has made appeals to conservatives to join his side.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMusk points out Mamdani appears on ballot twice. That's normal for New York.\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire Tesla owner who has endorsed Cuomo, wrongly suggested that because Zohran Mamdani is listed twice on the ballot, he could win twice.\n\nNew York allows candidates' names to appear on multiple ballot lines to reflect various party endorsements, which is often used as a way to give support for parties or causes outside of the traditional two-party system. But New Yorkers can only vote for a single candidate, as their ballot indicates.\n\nFor example, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa appears on both the GOP ballot line and Protect Animals ballot line. Sliwa’s wife Nancy, an animal welfare advocate, reportedly voted for her husband under the Protect Animals line.\n\nMamdani appears as the Democratic nominee and also as the candidate for the left-leaning Working Families Party. Independent candidate Cuomo is listed once, on the Fight and Deliver line.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nCuomo apologizes for COVID-19 deaths but says he 'did nothing wrong'\n\nCuomo, in an Election Day morning appearance on Fox News, said he was sorry to people whose loved ones died from COVID-19 while he was governor.\n\n\"I apologize for any family that lost a loved one during that time. It was on my watch, and I understand how terrible it was,\" Cuomo said.\n\nCuomo has been dogged during his campaign by ongoing accusations that, when he was governor, his administration undercounted the number of nursing home residents who died from the coronavirus.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James issued a report in 2021 finding that the state's Department of Health published data that may have undercounted those deaths by as much as 50%, and that nursing homes put residents at increased risk by failing to comply with infection control protocols.\n\nEven with his apology, Cuomo continued to defend his record.\n\n\"We followed all the federal rules. We did nothing wrong,\" he said. \"It was horrific, but everyone did the best that they could.\"\n\n–Aysha Bagchi\n\nCuomo says Trump is 'pragmatic' in endorsing him\n\nAndrew Cuomo said President Donald Trump was being realistic by telling Republican voters to support him against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani.\n\n“President Trump is pragmatic,” Andrew Cuomo said on the conservative talk show “Fox & Friends” on Tuesday morning. “He’s telling them the reality of this situation. If you do not vote, Mamdani is going to win.”\n\nTrump has increasingly voiced support for Cuomo against Mamdani, the frontrunner in the race. Cuomo, running as an independent, previously disavowed Trump's endorsement while also trying to pull Republican voters away from GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa, who trails in third.\n\n“Even if you’re not voting for a Republican, you’re voting to save New York City,” Cuomo said. “This election is not about Democrat or Republican. It’s about saving the city.”\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nSliwa, wearing a cat tie, accompanies wife to vote\n\nSporting his signature red beret and a tie decorated with cats, Curtis Sliwa accompanied his wife, Nancy, on Tuesday as she cast her ballot for her husband in the New York City mayoral race.\n\nSliwa, the Republican candidate running on the Protect Animals ballot line, said that the results of the city’s election will “be determined by the people, even if they don’t choose me” and not the “political elites.” While holding a book entitled, “Pawverbs for a Cat Lover's Heart,” Sliwa said that he has the people’s support.\n\n“Hopefully by the time the ballots are counted tonight, when all is said and done, I’ll be the next mayor of the City of New York,” he said. “And you know animals throughout the city will be partying hardy because they’ll have a friend both in Gracie Mansion and in City Hall.”\n\n–Rebecca Morin\n\nCandidates highlight their signature policy proposals\n\nThe three candidates vying for mayor gave vastly different closing arguments Tuesday while appearing on WNYC’s popular “The Brian Lehrer Show” to describe their signature policy proposal.\n\nMamdani, who has run on a campaign to address affordability, said his key issue was universal child care, which he wants to fund via taxes on the city’s wealthiest. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who would have to ultimately approve the tax hike with state lawmakers, has supported Mamdani’s proposal.\n\nSliwa cited his opposition to the city’s controversial housing proposals, which Cuomo and Mamdani support. Sliwa also pointed to opposition from City Council leadership, which is staunchly Democratic. “Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani are helping developers and realtors,” he said. “I’m standing with the people.”\n\nCuomo’s signature proposal was public safety, including hiring 5,000 new police officers. “Safety is the foundation,” he said. Mayor Eric Adams, who endorsed Cuomo, recently announced funding to hire 5,000 new NYPD officers. Recent data has showed a continued decline in major crimes in the city, with the lowest October for homicides since NYPD began tracking data in 1994.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMamdani votes 'yes' on NYC housing measures\n\nOutside of his polling place in Astoria, Queens, Mamdani told reporters he voted yes on New York City’s controversial ballot proposals 2 through 4, which Mayor Eric Adams' administration put forward in what proponents said is needed to address the city’s dire housing shortage.\n\nCity Council leadership opposed the measures, arguing it left local officials unable to respond to local needs of neighborhoods while concentrating power in the hands of the mayor and developers.\n\nMamdani hadn’t said whether he supported proposals until now. In the last mayoral debate on Oct. 22, his opponents and moderators ridiculed him for not having a response.\n\n“We urgently need more housing to be built across the five boroughs,” he told a New York Daily News reporter on Election Day, acknowledging councilmembers who opposed the measures based on concerns over investment in their communities. “I share the commitment to that investment. I look forward to working with them and delivering on that.”\n\nMamdani also voted no on ballot proposal to move city elections for offices such as mayor to presidential years in order to boost turnout.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\n'Our country has failed them.' Zohran Mamdani talks to USA TODAY about younger voters.\n\nCuomo declines to embrace Trump endorsement\n\nAndrew Cuomo declined to embrace President Donald Trump's last-minute endorsement of him in the final hours before Election Day. Trump urged his supporters to cast their ballots for Cuomo in a Nov. 3 evening post on Truth Social.\n\n\"Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!\" Trump said.\n\nRather than leaning into the endorsement, Cuomo highlighted that Trump previously called him a \"bad Democrat.\"\n\n\"Trump called me a bad Democrat? No I’m a good Democrat. A proud Democrat,\" Cuomo said in a Monday evening post on X.\n\nCuomo added that Trump wouldn't be sending ICE or the National Guard into New York City under his watch, and painted himself as someone who could stand up to the Republican president.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\nMamdani says he aims to ‘Trump-proof’ New York City\n\nMamdani said his economic plan aims to protect the city from President Donald Trump’s threat to provide it less federal funding.\n\nMamdani calls for a 2% tax on people making more than $1 million per year, to raise $4 billion per year, and seeks to increase the corporate tax rate to 11.5%, to generate $5 billion. Mamdani would also freeze the rent for 2.5 million residents in a city of 8.5 million people.\n\n“It would actually allow us to start Trump-proofing our city,” Mamdani told “The Beat with Ari Melber” on MSNBC on Monday. “We have to protect the New Yorkers with the least from the attacks from the man with the most power in this country.”\n\nTrump calls Mamdani a communist and said the federal government can’t afford to throw good money after bad if he is elected.\n\n“It's going to be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York,” Trump told “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMamdani calls Cuomo Trump’s ‘hand-picked’ candidate\n\nMamdani called Cuomo Trump’s “hand-picked” candidate in the race.\n\nTrump urged New Yorkers to vote for Cuomo, whom Mamdani already beat in the Democratic primary. Mamdani said voting for Cuomo in the heavily Democratic city would be the same as voting for Trump.\n\n“I'm saying that because Donald Trump has hand-picked his candidate. That candidate's name is Andrew Cuomo,” Mamdani told “The Beat with Ari Melber” on MSNBC on Monday. “And New Yorkers have the chance to handpick their fighter. And I believe that candidate should be me.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Zohran Mamdani?\n\nDemocratic candidate Zohran Mamdani is a 34-year-old democratic socialist and state lawmaker. He won election to the New York State Assembly in 2020 and represents the 36th district in Queens. Before joining the assembly, Mamdani worked for a year at a housing nonprofit.\n\nMamdani was born and raised in Kampala, Uganda, until the age of 7 when his family moved to New York City. He became a naturalized citizen in 2018.\n\nHe became the first South Asian man and Ugandan to join the assembly and is the third Muslim elected to the chamber.\n\nMamdani is the son of academic Mahmood Mamdani and prominent filmmaker Mira Nair. He married 28-year-old artist Rama Duwaji in February.\n\n−Kathryn Palmer\n\nWho is Andrew Cuomo?\n\nAndrew Cuomo, 67, is a former governor of New York running as an independent in the race to lead New York City. He is a lifelong Democrat and resigned as governor in 2021 due to a series of sexual harassment allegations that he has denied.\n\nHe is the son of the late three-term former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who also served as the state’s lieutenant governor and secretary of state. He has three children with former wife Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy. The pair divorced in 2005.\n\nBefore he became governor, Cuomo was a Manhattan assistant district attorney and worked in former President Bill Clinton’s administration in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). He later served one term as New York attorney general before making his bid for governor. Cuomo won his first gubernatorial election in 2010 and again in 2014 and 2018.\n\n−Kathryn Palmer\n\nWho is Curtis Sliwa?\n\nCurtis Sliwa, 71, is the Republican nominee in the race. He is the founder of the Guardian Angels, a citizen-led safety patrol group created in the 1970s to address subway crime.\n\nSliwa has hosted various radio talk shows for decades and ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 2021, losing in a landslide to current Democratic mayor Eric Adams.\n\nHe is married to animal activist and attorney Nancy Regula.\n\n−Kathryn Palmer\n\nWho are the candidates for NYC mayor?\n\nDemocratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from Queens, has been ahead in polls following his stunning win in the June primary against Andrew Cuomo, the three-term former New York governor who has sought to revive his political career after resigning in disgrace. If elected, Mamdani would be the first Muslim and the first South Asian to lead the city, and the first immigrant mayor in 80 years.\n\nCuomo, 67, running as an independent in the general election, has been consolidating voters against Mamdani, shrinking Mamdani’s lead headed into Election Day. A turnaround victory would be a monumental comeback for Cuomo, the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo.\n\nBut Cuomo still faces a roadblock by Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, the beret-wearing founder of the Guardian Angels vigilante group. Polls have indicated Sliwa’s conservative base could help Cuomo climb to compete against Mamdani, but Sliwa, 71, did not drop out.\n\nSliwa, a well-known New York City figure for decades, lost handily to Adams four years earlier. If a fractured electorate can't decide between Cuomo or Mamdani, Sliwa would be the first Republican elected in the heavily Democratic city since Mike Bloomberg.\n\nIs Eric Adams running for reelection?\n\nNew York City mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat-turned independent who trounced his Republican opponent in the 2021 election, is no longer running for a second term.\n\nAdams announced he was dropping out of the race on Sept. 28, after consistently polling far behind race frontrunners Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo.\n\nA little less than a month after he bowed out of the race, Adams endorsed Cuomo.\n\nHe had been pressured to drop out of the race for months after failing to shore up support following numerous scandals in his administration, including resignations and corruption allegations.\n\n-Kathryn Palmer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/04"}]}

Adrien Brody took home his second best actor Oscar for \"The Brutalist,\" the historical epic that picked up three wins. Kieran Culkin snagged best supporting actor for \"A Real Pain,\" while Zoe Saldaña got best supporting actress for Netflix's \"Emilia Pérez.\" And although \"Wicked\" only won a couple of trophies, stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo pulled off a rousing musical medley to kick off the night.\n\nHere are all the major highlights and big winners from the Oscar red carpet and the Academy Awards ceremony, hosted by Conan O'Brien:\n\n'Anora' wins best picture, the big prize of the night\n\n\"Anora\" is the little indie movie that could, winning best picture and taking down more conventional Oscar contenders like \"The Brutalist\" and \"Conclave.\" \"Long live independent film,\" says director Sean Baker, whose four-Oscar night ties Walt Disney's record haul from 1954.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nMikey Madison makes it four Oscars for 'Anora'\n\nDemi Moore's day will have to wait, because Mikey Madison just won best actress for \"Anora.\" \"Wow, this is very surreal,\" says a nervous Madison. She grew up in LA, but \"Hollywood felt so far away for me.\" Like Sean Baker, she honors the sex-worker community and says meeting those women was \"one of the highlights of this experience.\"\n\n'Anora' hat trick! Sean Baker gets his third win of the night, for best director\n\nSean Baker is on a roll, getting the best director Oscar for \"Anora.\" He makes his speech about the importance of movie theaters and making films for the big screen. \"At a time in which the world is more divided, this is more important than ever,\" he says. His mother introduced him to the cinema when he was 5 years old, and Baker dedicates the Oscar to her on her birthday.\n\nAdrien Brody gets his second best actor win for 'The Brutalist'\n\nAnother Timothée Chalamet victory wasn't to be: Adrien Brody takes the best actor Oscar for \"The Brutalist,\" the film's third win of the night. \"Thank you, God, for this blessed life,\" Brody says. \"Acting is a very fragile profession,\" he adds, and perspective has taught him that \"it can all go away. What makes this night so special is the awareness of that and the gratitude that I still get to do what I love.\"\n\nHe thanks his mom and dad for creating \"such a strong foundation of respect and kindness. They've given me the strength to pursue this dream.\" Brody also points out that he's at the Oscars again playing a Holocaust survivor – he won his first best actor Oscar for \"The Pianist\" – and representing \"the lingering traumas and repercussions\" of war, antisemitism and racism. \"I pray for a happier and more inclusive world,\" Brody says, hoping history can teach us that \"hate cannot go unchecked. Let's fight for what's right.\"\n\nConan O'Brien gets political, Queen Latifah leads Quincy Jones tribute\n\nConan O'Brien cracks a timely political joke, pointing out the success of \"Anora\": \"I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian.\" \"The Brutalist\" scores its second Oscar win of the night for, yes, original score, and then Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg come to the stage to introduce a tribute to producer and composer Quincy Jones.\n\n\"He was love lived out loud in human form,\" Winfrey said of Jones, who cast her in her first film, \"A Color Purple.\" Queen Latifah also pays homage, singing a lively rendition of \"Ease on Down the Road\" from \"The Wiz,\" which gets Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo up on their feet and dancing.\n\n'The Brutalist,' 'I'm Still Here' notch Oscar wins for cinematography, international film\n\n\"The Brutalist\" finally gets on the scoreboard, winning the Oscar for cinematography. And best international film goes to Brazil's \"I'm Still Here,\" which takes down leading nominee \"Emilia Pérez\" and animated favorite \"Flow.\" (It's also up for best picture later.)\n\nMorgan Freeman honors late co-star Gene Hackman as part of in memoriam tribute\n\nAfter \"I'm Not a Robot\" is named best live-action short, Morgan Freeman arrives to pay tribute to friend and \"Unforgiven\" co-star Gene Hackman to kick off the in memoriam segment. \"Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and his gifts elevated everyone's work,\" Freeman says. \"He won the hearts of film lovers all over the world.\" Hackman gets special treatment at the end of the program, as do David Lynch and James Earl Jones.\n\nSelena Gomez and fiancé Benny Blanco make an early exit from the Oscars, leaving the theater during the in memoriam as he holds her coat and handbag. On their way out, a Los Angeles fire department officer asks her to sign his 9-year-old daughter's handmade autograph book. Emma Stone is also spotted talking to Blackpink member Lisa and posing for a photo together.\n\nLive from the Oscar bar again: Emma Stone meets up with 'The Brutalist' crew\n\nDuring a commercial break, Emma Stone beelines over to Adrien Brody, who’s been holding court at the bar for a good chunk of the show, and she grabs his shoulder while he whispers in her ear. After hugging Brody’s girlfriend Georgina Chapman and the actor's \"The Brutalist\" co-star Alessandro Nivola, Stone orders a white wine and chats up Margaret Qualley, who’s waiting for drinks with husband Jack Antonoff. Meanwhile, Stone’s spouse, Dave McCary, stands off to the side by himself, sipping a tiny bottle of Don Julio tequila while he watches the show on the monitor.\n\n'Dune: Part Two' wins two technical Oscars\n\nMiles Teller and Miley Cyrus, an oddball pairing for sure, arrive to start a flurry of technical Oscars. First up is best sound – \"Sound is what I do, Miles,\" Cyrus purrs – which goes to \"Dune: Part Two.\" The sci-fi sequel also snags best visual effects, so that \"Dune\" sandworm is gonna par-tay tonight, y'all.\n\n'Dune' sandworm strikes back, Karla Sofía Gascón grabs champagne and attention\n\nConan O'Brien brings the \"Dune\" sandworm back for a bit – now he's playing the harp – before the documentary categories. \"The Only Girl in the Orchestra\" wins best documentary short – it's on Netflix and quite good if you have a chance to stream it! – while \"No Other Land\" is named best documentary feature.\n\nMeanwhile in the Dolby Theatre, Dennis Quaid hangs back in the bar area drinking white wine, while Willem Dafoe charges his phone on the other side of the room and Jeremy Strong walks back to his seat with a drink in hand but not before stopping to snap a smartphone photo of his date by the entrance. Jeff Goldblum and Felicity Jones share a laugh as they walk out of the theater during commercial break, while Kit Connor and Michael Gandolfini chitchat as they stroll over to the bar together.\n\nKarla Sofía Gascón also went to the lobby bar, followed by a crew of curious. Gascón walked up to Adrien Brody and they spoke for about a minute, with Brody speaking closely to the actress’ ear to keep from being overheard. When a reporter asked Gascón about her night, a publicist brushed her aside saying, “She’s having a wonderful night and now she is going to have a glass of champagne.” Gascon smiled and ordered before returning to the theater.\n\n'Wicked' brings production design Oscar home to the Yellow Brick Road, 'Emilia Pérez' takes best song\n\n\"Wicked\" takes the production design Academy Award – it's second win of the night – and if you've seen the movie, you get it. The musical is pretty darn cool to look at. And speaking of singing people, Mick Jagger hits the stage to give out the original song Oscar and garners a standing ovation. \"I wasn't the first choice. Producers really wanted Bob Dylan to do it\" but Dylan said no because \"all the best songs\" were in \"A Complete Unknown,\" Jagger quips. The Oscar goes to \"El Mal,\" giving \"Emilia Pérez\" its second Oscar of the evening as well, and Diane Warren goes home empty-handed once again for the 16th time. (Though she does have an honorary Academy Award!)\n\nZoe Saldaña makes history, wins supporting actress Oscar for 'Emilia Pérez'\n\n\"Anora\" gets its second win of the night as Sean Baker snags best editing. \"I saved this film in the editing. This director shouldn't work again,\" the filmmaker quips. (He also directed, FYI.) As we all wonder if \"Anora\" might actually pull off a best picture win here, Zoe Saldaña is named best supporting actress for \"Emilia Pérez\" to no one's shock. \"Mommy!\" she cries to her mother when accepting her first Oscar. She thanks the \"love and community\" shared by her fellow nominees and thanks her family: \"Everything brave and outrageous and good I've ever done is thanks to you.\" She also says she's the first American of Dominican origin to win an Academy Award and \"I hope I won't be the last.\"\n\nWooooo! 'The Substance' wins an Oscar! Plus James Bond gets a musical tribute\n\nIt has a chance at best picture, it should take best actress but \"The Substance\" is officially an Oscar winner. The bonkers body horror flick with Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley wins for best makeup and hairstyling. Tonight, Monstro Elisasue shall celebrate.\n\nAfterward, Halle Berry takes the stage for a fun montage and then Margaret Qualley dances with a bunch of guys in tuxes for a tribute to all things James Bond. Which Amazon will hopefully make a TV show that crosses over with \"Reacher\" because a non-secret-agent man can dream. But that's not all: Lisa from Blackpink sings \"Live and Let Die,\" Doja Cat does \"Diamonds Are Forever\" and Raye closes with \"Skyfall.\"\n\nBest picture hopefuls 'Anora,' 'Conclave' take screenplay Oscars\n\n\"Anora\" gets its first big win of the night: Sean Baker wins his first Oscar, for original screenplay, for \"Anora.\" He thanks his cast who \"who elevated everything I wrote and made me look very good\" and the sex-worker communities he's worked with over the years: \"I share this with you.\"\n\nThe other best picture favorite gets the other writing Oscar, as \"Conclave\" wins for adapted screenplay. In a sweet moment, Peter Straughan dedicates the win to his daughter but adds, \"That's not saying this is yours. It's not like that jumper you keep taking. This is mine.\"\n\nWhat everybody does get in the crowd is a little treat: Each seat in the Dolby Theatre has a box under it with bottled water, a soft pretzel, mustard, Milk Duds and a note/drawing from O'Brien.\n\nColman Domingo is the behind-the-scenes Oscar MVP\n\nWe'll see if he wins a best actor trophy tonight but Colman Domingo is the most popular guy in the Oscar crowd. He and Lupita Nyong'o give each other a kiss on the cheek before they head over to chat with Ariana Grande, Ethan Slater and Cynthia Erivo. Domingo and Erivo walk over to hug Ralph Fiennes, and then Domingo blows a kiss to Jeff Goldblum and also shakes Yura Borisov’s hand.\n\nIn non-Domingo news, supporting actress nominees Fernanda Torres and Monica Barbaro share a big embrace during the commercial break.\n\nBowen Yang wins the costume design presentation, 'Wicked' takes home the Oscar\n\nLily-Rose Depp, Elle Fanning, John Lithgow, Connie Nielsen and Bowen Yang are out to present the costume design Oscar and represent their respective nominated films. Yang, rocking his Shizz University student wear, is the only one actually wearing their costume. \"Et tu, Lithgow?\" he quips. All good, though, because \"Wicked\" costume designer Paul Tazewell becomes the first Black man to win the category.\n\nBy the way, this is how all Oscar technical awards should be handled: make it entertaining, with the stars of the movies. Good luck following that, best editing!\n\nLots of love going on in the Oscar crowd, especially with the 'Wicked' crew\n\nEverybody's in their feelings in the Oscars early going. When presenting the animated feature category, Andrew Garfield seemingly kisses Goldie Hawn’s hand during the nominee package. (He also was affectionate during Saturday rehearsals, where he hugged Hawn and gently kissed her on the top of the head as they practiced.) During commercial, Colman Domingo reaches over to shake Emma Stone’s hand and blow her kisses while she’s seated in the middle of the second row. There's also a \"Wicked\" group hug/selfie going on with Ariana Grande, Ethan Slater, Jeff Goldblum, Cynthia Erivo, Jon M. Chu and Grande's mom.\n\n'Flow' takes the animated movie prize and cartoon cats purr their approval\n\nNow here's the first upset of the night: \"Flow,\" a wordless Latvian film about a cat and his animals pals traversing a flooded landscape, takes the Oscar for best animated feature, defeating bigger studio movies like \"The Wild Robot\" and \"Inside Out 2.\" (\"Flow\" is in contention for best international film as well.) The Oscar for animated short goes to \"In the Shadow of the Cypress.\"\n\nNo surprise here: Kieran Culkin wins the supporting actor Oscar, makes great Oscar speech\n\nRobert Downey, last year's supporting actor winner, comes out to present the honor to this year's victor. He shouts out each one, calling Kieran Culkin \"The Culk.\" On this night, Culk smash! The \"A Real Pain\" star finishes an awards-season sweep with an Oscar. \"This means a lot coming from you,\" Culkin says to Downey. \"I have no idea how I got here. I've been acting my entire life,\" he adds, thanking his manager and co-star/director Jesse Eisenberg. He also mentions how he wanted a third kid with his wife Jazz Charton during an acceptance speech at the Emmys a year ago, and recounts afterward how she said \"I'll give you four if you win an Oscar.\" \"I say this to you, love of my life: I'm really sorry I did this again and let's get cracking on those kids,\" Culkin quips.\n\nOscar host Conan O'Brien spoofs 'The Substance,' jokes about Karla Sofía Gascón\n\nConan O'Brien does a bit spoofing \"The Substance\" to start his hosting gig. The \"four-time Oscar viewer\" comes on the stage and tells everyone to sit down. \"You never stood, OK,\" he says. O'Brien jokes about how he looks his age, the early time of the awards (\"Everyone just had brunch!\") and various movie titles: \"A Complete Unknown\" and \"A Real Pain\" were \"some of the things I was called on the red carpet.\"\n\nHe makes a jab at \"Wicked,\" saying it's for people who watched \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"wondered where all the minor characters went to college,\" and also \"Conclave\": \"It's about the Catholic Church but don't worry.\" O'Brien tackles \"Anora\" as well: It \"uses the f-word 479 times. That's three more than the record set by Karla Sofía Gascón's publicist.\"\n\nAfter a controversial awards season, Gascón is in the crowd tonight and O'Brien tells her, \"Remember: If you're going to tweet about the Oscars, my name is Jimmy Kimmel.\" She laughs and seems to get a kick out of it.\n\nIn the crowd, O'Brien points out Adam Sandler wearing a hoodie and gym shorts. Sandler is faux offended, but it's pretty much a gag just so Sandler can go over to Timothee Chalamet and shout \"Chalamet!!!\" (Absolutely worth it. No notes, guys.) Then O'Brien launches into a musical number about not wasting time, which features a \"Dune\" sandworm playing piano and dancing Deadpool.\n\nThe Academy Awards kick off with a 'Wicked' tribute to LA\n\n\"There's no place like home.\" The Oscars start with Judy Garland and her ruby shoes from \"The Wizard of Oz\" and roll out a montage of movie scenes from \"La La Land,\" \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" and other films to honor LA. Ariana Grande first comes out to sing a stirring rendition of \"Over the Rainbow,\" and then her \"Wicked\" co-star Cynthia Erivo arrives to belt \"Home\" from \"The Wiz\" to stick with the theme. Of course, they then meet each other on center stage and hold hands to do \"Defying Gravity.\" Erivo kills the big part at the end to make sure everyone gets the chills. Standing ovation, naturally.\n\nOscar guests rush to their places before the show starts\n\nWith only 10 minutes to go, Felicity Jones is standing by the bar chatting with her \"The Brutalist\" co-star Guy Pearce, who’s sipping champagne. Willem Dafoe is also chilling by the bar, which has since closed as everyone starts shuffling to their seats.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg is in the house, with a purple gown so long her friend is holding it up so she can get through the crowd. Goldberg's got a whole process: She stops to greet Wolfgang Puck, and the friend drops the gown. She and Wolfgang take photos, then the dress train is picked up and Goldberg makes her way into the theater.\n\nFilmmakers Ava DuVernay and Jon M. Chu are some of the last folks inside. Adrien Brody also makes a late entrance, shaking hands and smiling as he’s rushed into the theater. Somehow Timothée Chalamet is still on the carpet despite the urgent “last call” on the loud speaker. Jeremy Strong shot through the lobby. “Meet here, right?” he said to his date mid stride while rushing off in full Roy Cohn mode.\n\nMeanwhile Nick Offerman is on center stage: “I am your announcer for the evening.” Only minutes left until Conan O'Brien and Co. get the show started.\n\nLive from the Oscar seats: Rachel Zegler needs to get to the ball on time\n\nRachel Zegler gets ushered to the front of the elevator line in order to get to her seat on time, sweetly thanking and waving at fans who tell her she looks beautiful. With just 20 minutes until showtime, Jesse Eisenberg is having an animated conversation with a group by the lobby entrance, while Rachel Sennott, in a sparkling pink dress, walks hand in hand with her tuxedoed date. Miley Cyrus and her boyfriend smile as their tickets are checked at the door, but don’t acknowledge the guests shouting her name and filming on their smartphones. But Lupita Nyong’o took a photo with a fan (in the bathroom line!). Lots of fangirling happening, in general.\n\nWho's going to win the Oscar acting categories? (Or: Is it Demi Moore's night?)\n\nBoth Kieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\") and Zoe Saldaña (\"Emilia Pérez\") are locks for the supporting races. But there is some drama to be had in the lead acting categories. While Brody (\"The Brutalist\") won an early Golden Globe for best actor, Chalamet came on late with momentum and scored the SAG trophy – at this point, he might be the safest bet, considering six of the last seven SAG winners also won Oscar. Meanwhile best actress is up for grabs between Moore (SAG, Critics Choice and Globe wins) and Madison (BAFTA win). Given Moore's four-decade history in Hollywood and her comeback narrative with \"The Substance,\" she's the favorite. See more of our predictions here.\n\nSpeaking of Moore, she smiled some hellos while sailing to her seat in the Dolby Theatre, surviving one interloper stepping on her trailing gown. Selena Gomez did not even stop, swanning to her place. \"Wicked\" star Marissa Bode is the star of the lobby, waving to FaceTime calls and posing for selfies with fans. Meanwhile Bernie Taupin, who's rocking sunglasses, and Brandi Carlile are hanging out in a corner, talking in animated conversations and taking photos.\n\nMindy Kaling, Joe Locke mingle with fans in Academy Awards lobby\n\nMindy Kaling, shimmering in a silver Oscar de la Renta gown, walks into the Dolby Theatre lobby and is immediately greeted by multiple fans asking for selfies. “Heartstopper” and \"Agatha All Along\" breakout Joe Locke, wearing a glittery gold vest, similarly obliges someone’s picture request, while “Queer” actor Omar Apollo sits and scrolls on his smartphone in a mesh veiled headpiece.\n\nLive from the Oscar bar: Jeff Goldblum and salmon pizza\n\nWe're starting to get reports from our people on the inside at the Academy Awards. \"Nickel Boys\" star Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor is one of the first stars to hang out in the Dolby Bar. Tired from the red carpet walk, with her long train bunched up next to her, the star enjoyed some hors d’oeuvres including steak tartar and salmon pizza. Outside, Jeff Goldblum arrived making conversation while wearing the largest purple corsage ever and enjoying snacks.\n\nGovernors Ball continues to be the Oscar after-party\n\nThe Dolby Theatre isn’t just venue to the Oscars ceremony – it’s also the place where stars will get down at the Governors Ball, the famed official after-party where stars enjoy decadent desserts from Wolfgang Puck and munch on iconic chocolate Oscars statues. It’s also where winners go to get their trophies engraved. This year’s Governors Ball promises to be no less luxurious than in years past. There’s going to be a Don Julio bar serving an assortment of custom mixed tequila drinks. Also on the menu? Dassai Blue sake – which is a first-time Oscars partner – as well as Lallier champagne and Clarendelle Bordeaux wine.\n\nWhat movie is predicted to win the best picture Oscar?\n\nThe romantic dramedy \"Anora\" had picked up some momentum winning the top awards from the directors' and producers' guilds – a strong bellwether for Oscar victory. But at last week's Screen Actors Guild Awards, papal thriller \"Conclave\" upended \"Anora\" to win best ensemble. That and a win for best movie at the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) could give it the edge.\n\nThere's been no clear frontrunner this entire Oscar cycle, so we might be in for a surprise tonight: If \"The Brutalist\" cleans up the technical awards early in the night, that could foretell a win, or a perhaps a dark horse like the music biopic \"A Complete Unknown\" or acclaimed body horror movie \"The Substance\" – with key filmmaking and acting nods – could be an upset in waiting.\n\nWhich celebrities will be presenting at the Academy Awards? (Hint: Not Harrison Ford.)\n\nIf you were hoping to see Indiana Jones tonight, well, you better stream \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" Harrison Ford was supposed to present at the Oscars but dropped out due to shingles. (Which honestly is a really good reason.) There will still be plenty of A-list talent taking the stage, though.\n\nLast year's victors in the four acting categories − Robert Downey Jr., Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Cillian Murphy and Emma Stone − will all be there to welcome the next class of winners. Other famous names on tap include Halle Berry, Scarlett Johansson, Sterling K. Brown, Ana de Armas, Lily-Rose Depp, Selena Gomez, Goldie Hawn, Oprah Winfrey, Gal Gadot, Samuel L. Jackson and Rachel Zegler.\n\nWho is hosting this year's Oscars show?\n\nComedian and talk show host Conan O'Brien is the latest to emcee the glitzy event. Four-time host Jimmy Kimmel did it a year ago but chose not to in 2025 because he \"didn't want to deal with\" juggling the Academy Awards with his late-night gig.\n\nAt an Oscar news conference last week, O'Brien, 61, said he consulted with former hosts like Billy Crystal (\"He's the all-time great\") and will address the challenging political climate but promised not to bog the show down with divisive jokes. \"As the host, I cannot ignore the moment we’re in,\" O'Brien said. \"But we’re threading the needle, and we have to remember what we’re celebrating and infuse the show with positivity. It’s a difficult line to walk, but I’m determined to figure it out.\"\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander, Marco della Cava, David Oliver, Patrick Ryan, Jay Stahl and Charles Trepany", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/02/28/oscars-films-that-deserved-best-picture-wins/80560342007/", "title": "Oscar best picture winners that weren't – and what should have won", "text": "Feb. 28, 2025, 9:30 a.m. ET\n\nAfter 96 years of Oscar best pictures, the Academy's bound to get one wrong now and then.\n\nAmazingly, they got it pretty right in recent years: In 2020, South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's \"Parasite\" became the first foreign-language film to win the prized category in Oscars history, galvanizing all corners of the movie industry. That was followed by inspired choices including \"CODA\" in 2022 and \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" in 2023. (Though we're still a little miffed \"RRR\" didn't even rate a best picture nod.) And as much as we loved \"Barbie,\" they could have made a far worse choice last year than \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nSometimes, it's a little more chaotic. Remember Envelopegate? At the 2017 Academy Awards, the musical \"La La Land\" was named best picture – and then it wasn't, when the correct envelope revealed indie drama \"Moonlight\" as the winner. As if the gods of cinema inserted themselves to make sure the right movie was honored rather than the one with the guy trying to save jazz.\n\nOr you have a situation like the 2019 ceremony, where we all thought \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" would be the worst-case scenario. Instead, \"Green Book\" took the Oscar and left a bad taste in some mouths.\n\n\"The ref made a bad call,\" Spike Lee said that night. Well, it wasn't the first time.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nBefore another movie joins the hallowed ranks at the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday (ABC and Hulu, 7 p.m. ET/4 PT), we're rethinking past best picture winners and the films that should have conquered them.\n\n1942\n\nDid win: \"How Green Was My Valley\"\n\nShould have won: \"Citizen Kane\"\n\nPerhaps the most egregious mistake came relatively early in Oscars history, with John Ford's coal-country drama – which took five Academy Awards to alone \"Kane\" screenplay win – getting the nod over Orson Welles' epic about an eccentric media mogul that is widely regarded as the best movie ever made.\n\n1953\n\nDid win: \"The Greatest Show on Earth\"\n\nShould have won: \"High Noon\"\n\nEven with a stellar cast – including Charlton Heston, Dorothy Lamour and Jimmy Stewart – \"Greatest Show\" is essentially a 152-minute commercial for the circus. They must have been clowning around because this category also included \"High Noon,\" one of the greatest Westerns of the genre's golden age, with Gary Cooper as a cool lawman.\n\n1967\n\nDid win: \"A Man for All Seasons\"\n\nShould have won: \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"\n\nThat year's best picture win went to a rousingly successful Sir Thomas More biopic, along with a bunch of awards-season gold. But come on, \"Man,\" they should have gone for Mike Nichols' debut black comedy about marital strife. It's absolutely nuts, risky for its time, and features astounding turns from Richard Burton and especially Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n1974\n\nDid win: \"The Sting\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Exorcist\"\n\nBoth were huge hits that came in with 10 nominations, and Robert Redford and Paul Newman's ragtime-tinged con-man caper was the safe choice. \"The Exorcist\" was the true standout, a fright-fest masterpiece about faith and innocence that's scared the socks off audiences for more than 50 years.\n\n1980\n\nDid win: \"Kramer vs. Kramer\"\n\nShould have won: \"Apocalypse Now\"\n\nNot to take anything away from the wrenching look at divorce with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, but \"Apocalypse Now\" was unlike any war film that came before it, an operatic and grandiose episode that delved into the horrors, physical and otherwise, inherent on the battlefield.\n\n1982\n\nDid win: \"Chariots of Fire\"\n\nShould have won: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"\n\nOne was a true-life story of Olympic athletes that we remember now mostly because of its catchy theme song. The other was a rip-roaring, two-fisted and hugely influential ode to the serial adventures of yesteryear – with an adventurous archaeologist on the hunt for the Ark of the Covenant – that took pop culture by storm. And a \"Raiders\" win would have been a game-changer for blockbusters.\n\n1986\n\nDid win: \"Out of Africa\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Color Purple\"\n\nThe epic romance with Robert Redford and Meryl Streep in colonial Kenya won over Oscar voters but not critics, who gave \"Africa\" mixed reviews. The Academy whiffed by not honoring a film with Whoopi Goldberg's Golden Globe-winning performance, Oprah Winfrey's high-profile Hollywood debut and Steven Spielberg's honest exploration of racism, sexism and domestic violence in the early 20th century.\n\n1990\n\nDid win: \"Driving Miss Daisy\"\n\nShould have won: \"Field of Dreams\"\n\nThe pairing of Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman in a heartwarming dramedy about an elderly white woman and her African-American driver took down \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"My Left Foot\" and \"Dead Poets Society.\" Good movies all around, but none as excellent as the corn-fed Kevin Costner fantasy that captured the wonders of baseball and, yes, dreams.\n\n1995\n\nDid win: \"Forrest Gump\"\n\nShould have won: \"Pulp Fiction\"\n\nTom Hanks literally running through history in the overly earnest \"Gump\" is what the Oscars, at least back in the day, lived for. Not so much Quentin Tarantino's genre mashup \"Pulp Fiction,\" an ultraviolent, narratively complex cultural phenomenon that wasn't just the best picture that year but arguably of the entire decade.\n\n1997\n\nDid win: \"The English Patient\"\n\nShould have won: \"Fargo\"\n\nAnthony Minghella's romantic World War II drama is a fine film, though it tests viewers' patience over the course of three hours. On the other hand, \"Fargo\" spawned a TV series and a fandom for the Coen brothers' winningly quirky black comedy about murderous deeds and dimwits in snow-covered Minnesota.\n\n1999\n\nDid win: \"Shakespeare in Love\"\n\nShould have won: \"Saving Private Ryan\"\n\n\"Dunkirk\" and \"1917\" have also gone the route of putting the audience right in the middle of the horrors of war, but \"Private Ryan\" did it best – and with \"America's Dad\" Tom Hanks, no less. \"Shakespeare\" had an intriguing concept as a referential, experimental biopic but it has no business upending another Spielberg classic.\n\n2005\n\nDid win: \"Million Dollar Baby\"\n\nShould have won: \"The Aviator\"\n\nMartin Scorsese would end up getting his big Oscar win two years later for \"The Departed\" but it should have happened with \"Aviator.\" The Howard Hughes biopic, piloted by Leonardo DiCaprio's fantastic descent into eccentric madness, is a no-brainer over Clint Eastwood's above-average boxing drama with the super-downer ending.\n\n2006\n\nDid win: \"Crash\"\n\nShould have won: \"Brokeback Mountain\"\n\nPaul Haggis' interwoven all-star drama about racial tensions in LA, plagued by mixed reviews and complaints of stereotyping, has caught flak for years as an Oscar fail. And it is, especially considering Ang Lee's timeless and resonant \"Brokeback\" was sitting right there, with Jake Gyllenhaal and the late Heath Ledger as cowboys in a forbidden love affair.\n\n2011\n\nDid win: \"The King's Speech\"\n\nShould have won: \"Black Swan\"\n\nThe consensus at the time was that period drama \"King's Speech,\" with Colin Firth's George VI working through a troublesome stutter, pulled an upset on David Fincher's vaunted Facebook bio \"The Social Network.\" Yet flying above both was the polarizing \"Swan,\" Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman's weird and wonderful character study of an embattled ballerina.\n\n2019\n\nDid win: \"Green Book\"\n\nShould have won: \"BlacKkKlansman\"\n\n\"Green Book\" is a fine, well-acted movie but on a night where many Black voices were honored, the top prize went to a film about race relations from a white point of view. Spike Lee's \"BlacKkKlansman,\" however, would have been the ideal choice: an entertaining, thought-provoking cop drama that digs into America's racist past to mirror our own tumultuous times.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/entertainment/gallery/oscar-best-picture-winners", "title": "Here's every film that won the Oscar for best picture | CNN", "text": "\"It Happened One Night\" (1935): \"It Happened One Night\" was one of the great underdog winners.

Awards ignored the best movies", "text": "Updated March 11, 2024, 4:57 p.m. ET\n\nI’d be remiss to say the Oscars aren’t out of touch, most award shows are. Despite that, this year's Oscars got a couple things right.\n\nThe show had a joyous start with Da’Vine Joy Randolph winning best supporting actress for her painfully beautiful portrayal of Mary in \"The Holdovers.\" \"Poor Things\" swept the visual categories. \"Oppenheimer\" won seven awards, including Cillian Murphy winning best actor. \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" a brilliant film that more people should watch, deservedly won best original screenplay.\n\nDespite these satisfying wins (justice for Lily Gladstone), my mind was constantly thinking about the films and actors unrecognized. I remember the day nominations came and many were upset that \"Barbie,\" despite receiving eight nominations, was not nominated for best actress or director. There was a bounty of articles and essays articulating that disappointment, and I’m sure we’re in for even more after \"Barbie\" lost all but one Oscar Sunday night (congrats, Billie Eilish).\n\nHowever, the outrage was somewhat lost on me. I enjoyed \"Barbie\" well enough. I definitely think Greta Gerwig should have been nominated for best director, but the overwhelming outcry about the snubs seemed a tad disproportionate.\n\nSomehow \"Barbie\" only getting eight nominations was a loss to feminism even though other films like \"Anatomy of a Fall\" – which arguably offers a more nuanced portrayal of womanhood – received many nominations. It seemed to me like those who felt most maligned simply hadn’t watched any other films.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nThe best films and performances the Oscars didn't award\n\nIn fact, there were many movies and performances that were tragically overlooked at Sunday night’s ceremony and awards season as a whole.\n\n\"May December\" is based on the true story that took over popular culture in the 1990s of a middle school teacher pursuing a relationship with her student. The film stars Julianne Moore, Natalie Portman and Charles Melton. That trio gave some of the best acting performances of 2023, yet the cast did not receive a single nomination. The only nomination the film did receive was for best original screenplay, which it lost to \"Anatomy of a Fall.\" It’s certainly not lost on me, however, that a film satirizing Hollywood exploitation wasn’t received warmly by Hollywood.\n\nI watched Oscar best picture nominees. 'Oppenheimer' will win, but here's what should.\n\n\"Past Lives,\" a film that chronicles two childhood lovers who reconnect after 20 years, received two nominations for best original screenplay and best picture, unfortunately losing both. What struck me was that for a film that is so atmospheric yet character-driven, it received no acting nominations.\n\nMany on film twitter voiced their disappointment with Greta Lee, who plays one half of the long lost lovers, Nora, not receiving a nomination for best actress. Teo Yoo, who plays Hae Sung, deserves to be part of the conversation as well. Yoo brings Hae Sung to life with such care. He portrays him with a subtly heartbreaking arrested development that’s borne out of the love he lost to Nora at such a young age. His performance is quiet, nuanced and empathetic – and it’s almost criminal that he was left out of the awards conversation.\n\nOscar nods honor 'Oppenheimer,' but what about Americans still suffering from nuke tests?\n\nThe best films and actors the Oscars didn't even nominate\n\nA.V. Rockwell’s incredible feature directorial debut, \"A Thousand and One,\" tells the story of a mother, Inez, who takes her son, Terry, from foster care to raise him in Harlem, where she grew up. The heartbreak of the film unfolds quietly as the audience are mere observers to the cyclical nature of poverty and the crime it breeds.\n\nAmon Warmann from \"Empire\" perfectly articulates the gravitas of Teyana Taylor’s performance as Inez: “At almost every turn she unveils new capabilities, playing all of Inez’s varied notes without sanding off her raw edges. It’s an eye-opening performance that should have us all excited about her future onscreen work.”\n\nThe film received zero nominations.\n\nAndrew Scott in \"All of Us Strangers\" was another performance tragically ignored by the Oscars. The film follows Adam, played by Scott, as he is pulled back into his childhood home and attempts to reconcile his identity and trauma with the ghosts of his late parents. He finds solace in Harry, played handsomely by Paul Mescal. It’s almost a miracle they found each other given their isolation.\n\nRelationships like that are like an oasis in a desert of sand. The film examines love, loss and the pain therein, and the ambiguous shades of gray in which life often paints.\n\nThe list goes on: \"The Iron Claw,\" Ava DuVernay’s \"Origin\" and \"Anatomy of a Fall\" actor Milo Machado-Graner, who gave one of the best performances last year (too bad the academy hates children). Many of the best films and most riveting performances were overlooked by the Oscars.\n\nNevertheless, I understand not everything can be awarded – snubs are bound to happen. It’s just how it is. But the film enjoyer in me, selfishly or otherwise, wants everyone to take home at least a nugget of Oscar gold.\n\nKofi Mframa is a music and culture writer and opinion intern at the Louisville Courier-Journal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/03/03/did-anora-deserve-oscars-best-picture-win/81164750007/", "title": "'Anora' won best picture at the 2025 Oscars. But was it deserved?", "text": "March 3, 2025 Updated March 4, 2025, 10:43 a.m. ET\n\nSometimes, Oscars best picture winners make sense to me. Other times, there's an “Anora.”\n\nSean Baker’s indie romantic dramedy conquered Sunday’s 97th Academy Awards ceremony, winning five honors including best picture and actress. Ever since it took home the Palme d’Or from Cannes last year and became a film festival favorite for many critics last fall, pundits touted it as an Oscar front-runner. Though there were a couple of Screen Actors Guild and British Academy Film Awards zigs and zags in there, “Anora” did finally conquer all.\n\nAnd I still don’t quite understand why.\n\nIf I were an Oscar voter, “Anora” would have ranked ninth out of 10 on my preferential ballot. (Sorry, “Wicked.”) It was a good movie, sure, but seemed lightweight when compared to the excellent papal thriller “Conclave” or the awesome historical epic “The Brutalist” or the electric music biopic “A Complete Unknown” or the actually-innovative-for-a-change “Nickel Boys.”\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nIn fact, I can recall when I first wondered why all this hubbub: During the very nude first 20 strip-club minutes of “Anora.” For those who had never heard of the R-rated film before Sunday or were waiting for it to stream (Hulu, March 17!), it stars best actress winner Mikey Madison as a brassy Brooklyn exotic dancer named Ani who, because she can speak Russian, is tasked with getting to know Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn), an oligarch’s son.\n\nEven though Vanya is a complete man-child and our girl Ani can do way better, he pays her to hang out with him (read: sex) and on a Las Vegas trip, they elope. They get back to his Brighton Beach mansion, Vanya’s parents are coming to America because they aren’t pleased, and a bunch of goons like good-hearted Igor (Yura Borisov) try to keep Ani in check when Vanya bails on his new wife.\n\nSo, Gen Z “Pretty Woman” then turns into a screwball comedy trip through Manhattan trying to find Vanya, but “Anora” finally gets Oscar-y good in the final act. Ani butts heads with Vanya’s forceful mom and you start to realize this Cinderella romance may end very badly. There’s one bittersweet moment between Igor and Ani, who desperately wants an emotional connection instead of a sexual one, that makes the movie.\n\nHere's the thing: For me, Borisov is the best part of the entire flick, giving a supporting character surprising depth and magnetic energy. But does he equal a best picture victory? Nah. Does Madison? Nope. She’s good but, come on now, she’s no Demi Moore just going ballistic in “The Substance.”\n\nAt the same time, “Anora\" is representative of the positive direction the Academy has been going in recent years. Conventional Oscar movies like “Conclave” and “The Brutalist,” or even last year’s best picture “Oppenheimer,” will always be there on Academy Awards night. But going back to “Moonlight” taking down “La La Land” in 2017, niche winners like “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “Parasite,” “CODA” and “Nomadland” are thankfully more the rule than the exception. It’s an example of how international and diverse the Academy voting body has grown since the days of #OscarsSoWhite.\n\nAre they to the point of honoring a bonkers body-horror flick like “The Substance,” a movie with substance that talks about aging in Hollywood and the critical way we look at our superficial selves? Well, no, because that would be groundbreaking. (It’s not lost on anybody paying attention that Oscar night pretty much turned out to be “The Substance” come to life, with the older actress getting upended by the younger model.)\n\nAs much as things have changed, Oscar is gonna Oscar. We’re going to get a “Crash” or a “Green Book” every so often, and “Anora” is a good pick comparatively to those. All we can do is love the movies we love (and champion the heck out of them), root for our favorites to maybe get a statue at the end of the night, but not get too bent out of shape if they lose. They say don’t go to bed angry, which I kind of did, but I’m feeling better.\n\nIf it leads to a “Substance” one day standing triumphant on stage when the Oscar credits roll, then the occasional “Anora” seems bearable.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/fsu-news/2023/03/10/fsu-alumni-contribute-to-oscar-nominated-films-for-2023-academy-awards/69982633007/", "title": "FSU alumni contribute to Oscar-nominated films for 2023 Academy ...", "text": "March 10, 2023, 5:06 a.m. ET\n\nAs the nation tunes in to this year’s anticipated Oscars, Florida State University has more than one reason to watch — five FSU alumni are a part of multiple award-nominated films.\n\nAmong the nominees with ties to the university is FSU alumni Allison Rose Carter, co-producer of the 2022 film “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” which is being considered for the Best Picture and Best Director awards.\n\nShe graduated with a bachelor’s degree in fine arts from FSU in 2004.\n\n“The FSU film school taught me that I was most interested in the daring challenges of independent film and brought me together with a group of like-minded adventurers,” Carter said in a prepared statement. “There are so many people at FSU who helped bring me to where I am, and I will forever be grateful.”\n\nFSU ties to award nominations: Two former FSU Marching Chiefs named Grammy finalists\n\nThree other films that have been nominated for Best Animated Feature have FSU alumni connections as well.\n\nMarc Ostroff, a 1997 alumnus who also earned his bachelor’s degree in fine arts, was a finance executive on “Pinocchio” and “The Sea Beast” — both of which are films nominated for the category.\n\nSara Bennett Crowley, who graduated from the university in 2004 along with Carter, also played a role in creating the “Pinocchio” film while serving as production manager.\n\nIn addition, FSU 1993 graduate Brendan Murphy was associate production manager on the nominated film “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” for the Best Animated Feature category.\n\nAnother FSU alumni among this year’s Oscar nominations is Ivette Garcia, who was the casting director for a Best Animated Short.

A “renewed battle for votes” is now under way, the BBC said, with the president’s team prioritising “a series of big rallies and major TV appearances”.\n\nLe Pen, who won 23.1% of the vote in the first round, can almost certainly “count on supporters of Éric Zemmour, whose more hardline nationalism won him fourth place and 7%”, the broadcaster added.\n\nNationalist Nicolas Dupont-Aignan has also endorsed her, meaning the National Rally leader can “count on an impressive 33% of the entire vote”.\n\nMacron, who won 27.8% of the vote, is widely expected to pick up the 5% of voters who backed Green candidate Yannick Jadot, as well as the 4.8% that voted for the conservative Valérie Pécresse.

Mélenchon has urged his supporters not to vote for Le Pen, but has not directly endorsed Macron.\n\nThey “could decide the election as Macron tries to win them over in order to hold back the far-right”, the paper added, but they could stay at home with their candidate out of the race. The “youth vote”, which largely backed Mélenchon, “will be crucial” for Macron.\n\n“Some of his supporters have told pollsters they will vote for Le Pen on the opposite end of the political spectrum”, the FT said, while “polling from both Ipsos and Elabe shows Mélenchon supporters splitting their votes three ways between abstaining, backing Macron and voting for Le Pen in a second round”.\n\nThis means that the president faces a battle to hold together a “republican front” made up of the political centre, soft-right, soft-left and hard-left in order to beat Le Pen’s ready-made coalition of “populists and nationalists”, the paper added.\n\nUnlikely bedfellows\n\nWhile the run-off between Macron and Le Pen is a direct repeat of 2017’s election, “the 2022 race has so far been anything but a replay of the contest Macron won five years ago”, France 24 reported.\n\n“This race has been all but a procession to a predictable result”, with Macron moving to “temper the festivities” of his first round victory.\n\nHis presidency has “left mainstream conservatives in tatters and leftists exasperated”, the broadcaster added, with experts warning that “the republican front isn’t certain to sweep to the rescue this time and carry Macron to a second term”.\n\nMélenchon’s voters are by no means the natural bedfellows of the incumbent, who has “pledged to continue his economic reforms and maintain his policy of liberal internationalism” if he wins a second term, the FT reported.\n\nOne Mélenchon voter told The Guardian they were “worried about people not bothering to turn out to vote in the final round”, adding: “I voted Mélenchon because he was fighting for equality and there were a load of racists running for president. I’m wondering what to do myself, whether to vote Macron or just a blank ballot.”\n\nThat sentiment has been echoed by other supporters of the leftist firebrand.

The answer can be traced back to a recent normalisation of reactionary politics.\n\nIn truth, the existence of a far-right government in Italy is not entirely without precedent in the post-war era. Between 1994 and 2011 a speciously labelled “centre-right” alliance – consisting of Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (FI), various iterations of a small Christian democratic or centrist wing, Umberto Bossi’s Northern League (LN) and Gianfranco Fini’s National Alliance (AN) – governed Italy four times.

He believed him to be one of Italy’s “greatest statesmen” and an essentially “benign dictator” who had “done good things for Italy”. This provided a counter-narrative that contradicted the reality of the Italian republic’s anti-fascist foundations. That, in turn, was exploited by the far right.\n\nThe Northern League first emerged as a series of parties seeking greater autonomy for Italy’s prosperous northern regions. And the National Alliance was the latest iteration of a neo-fascist tradition which has roots in the Italian Social Movement (MSI) established by veterans of Mussolini’s Italian Social Republic in 1946.\n\nBoth parties helped bring far-right and reactionary policies into the mainstream as coalition partners in Berlusconi-led administrations.\n\nThe balance of power in this alliance shifted decisively between 2013 and 2017 when Matteo Salvini took the reins of the Northern League. He gradually abandoned regionalism for nationalism and appealed to the far and extreme right, adopting the slogan “Italians First”, which was previously used by the neo-fascist party Casa Pound. The (now renamed) League partnered with the Five Star Movement to govern as what was euphemistically termed a “populist” coalition between 2018 and 2019.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nExtreme views packaged as ‘common sense’\n\nThis was a period which saw, among other reactionary policies, a “security decree” which tightened immigration regulations, limited the right to asylum and made the expulsion of migrants and revocation of citizenship easier. The decree was ultimately overturned in 2020 but by that time it had already served as a symbolic victory for Salvini.\n\nBack in 2017, Salvini promised Italian voters a “common sense revolution�� – a trope which soon became central to his party’s political messaging. The idea was to bring far-right ideology into the mainstream by portraying extreme, racist policies as “normal” ideas based on views shared by “ordinary Italians”.\n\nLike many populist far-right politicians, he thrived on the idea that he was saying out loud what “everyone was really thinking”. Salvini claimed to be putting “Italians first” – although he really meant white, Catholic, straight Italians from “traditional” (read mother and father) families. He also promoted closing borders and clearing migrant camps.\n\nSalvini’s common sense image, while deeply flawed, initially proved a successful electoral tactic. But by 2019 he started to lose control of the narrative, largely thanks to a series of miscalculations.\n\nThe first of these was his ill-fated decision to pull the plug on the government he had formed in coalition with the Five Star Movement in 2018. Fuelled by hubris induced by strong polling figures and in the hope of triggering elections, Salvini withdrew support for the government. But his gamble did not pay off. He instead consigned his party to the opposition benches.\n\nMeloni profits from Salvini’s tactics\n\nSalvini’s losses have been Meloni’s gains and the balance of power on Italy’s political right has once again shifted away from the League. With Salvini spending the past two years lending his parliamentary support to the government, Meloni has been able to position herself as having been “alone in opposition” – and therefore as being more in touch with “real Italians”.\n\nMeanwhile, she has capitalised on his success at bringing far-right and reactionary ideas further into the mainstream.\n\nA key element of Salvini’s “common sense” strategy was downplaying the threat of fascism and arguing that calling for law and order or stronger borders is not fascistic. This has created the perfect conditions for neo-fascists to thrive.\n\nMeloni has been free to claim that her party has shaken off its fascist past even as she espouses obviously hardline views. What might be termed a post-fascist strategy is unfolding.\n\nMeloni can gaslight the public by making fascist assertions while claiming fascism no longer exists. Importantly, those who warn that fascism is making a comeback are derided as irrational.\n\nThis is all exemplified in the dog whistle references to Mussolini that have characterised the 2022 election campaign. Both the League and Brothers of Italy have deployed campaign slogans first used in the fascist era. The latter has even kept the tricolour flame logo used by its predecessors, the neo-fascist MSI.\n\nMeloni opposes same-sex marriage, wants to put significant curbs on access to abortion to address the “emergency” of Italy’s declining birth rate and has made explicit references Europe’s supposed “Judeo-Christian” roots. The latter is a common Islamophobic trope that has long formed a key part of European far-right ideology.\n\nHer racism is also evident in a depiction of immigration as an invasion – via calls for a naval blockade and portrayal of “undocumented migration” as a UN plot. This plays willingly on racist “great replacement” narratives.\n\nMeloni’s success may shock, but it should not surprise. She is a canny social media operator and expert strategist but her path has been cleared by many figures that came before her. Salvini now follows her lead but his work to shift the Overton window of what is mainstream in politics has made her the politician she is today. That was a process that took years and unfolded in front of our very eyes.\n\nGeorge Newth, lecturer in Italian politics, University of Bath.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

He also holds a master’s degree in international politics from City, University of London.\n\nAfter returning to Afghanistan, he was appointed CEO of the Massoud Foundation, a non-profit organisation that provides support to poor Afghans in the areas of “culture, health, training and education”.\n\nA critic of the peace negotiations between the Trump administration and the Taliban, he formed a new coalition of mujahideen leaders – modelled on the Northern Alliance that his father helped found in the 1990s – before declaring his opposition to Taliban rule following their sweeping gains in recent months.\n\nWriting in The Washington Post last week, Massoud said that “common struggle is more essential than ever in these dark, tense hours for my homeland”. He said that he is “ready to follow in my father’s footsteps, with mujahideen fighters who are prepared to once again take on the Taliban”.\n\nHe called for aid from “Afghanistan’s friends in the West”, adding that his supporters “share your values” and want “an open society” where “girls could become doctors, our press could report freely, our young people could dance and listen to music or attend soccer matches in the stadiums that were once used by the Taliban for public executions”.\n\n‘We do not want a war’\n\nThe number of fighters currently operating under the banner of the NRF is thought to be “more than 6,000”, Al Jazeera reported. However, “while he is prepared to fight, Massoud has said he still hopes to hold peaceful talks with the Taliban”.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, he said that his militia “want to make the Taliban realise that the only way forward is through negotiation”, adding: “We do not want a war to break out.” Asked how his supporters would respond if the Taliban attempted to take the Panjshir Valley by force, he said: “They want to defend, they want to fight, they want to resist against any totalitarian regime.”\n\nFor Massoud, “​​France is the most natural place to turn as he tries to marshal a resistance army”, Politico said, as his father remains “a household name” in the country and “lives on as the country’s epitome of a freedom fighter thanks to his battles against the Soviets and Taliban in the 1980s and 1990s”.\n\nHe also has an “intermediary with the top echelons of power” in Paris, the French public intellectual and philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, who travelled to the Panjshir Valley to write a story on him for the magazine Paris Match last October.\n\nWriting on Unherd last week, Levy said that “Massoud has been quietly preparing for the worst and stockpiling arms, equipment and supplies, as his father had done”, adding: “I trust him.”\n\n“I believe him when he says he inherited from his father the taste for freedom and the instinct of fighting to defend it,” Levy continued. “I believe that when he issues a call for all free Afghans who love their country and reject servitude, whether living in Afghanistan or abroad, to join him, he is not only sincere but credible.”\n\nFor the NRF’s supporters, “surrender is not an option”, The Telegraph said. But “in the face of the Taliban’s overwhelming military superiority and lacking international support”, the paper added, Massoud may be forced to “choose between capitulation and his vow to fight to the last breath if he cannot reach an honourable settlement”.\n\nHowever, inspired by Shah Massoud’s battle against the Soviet Union, the NRF appears undeterred.\n\n“The Red Army, with its might, was unable to defeat us,” Ali Nazary, head of foreign relations for the NRF, told the BBC.\n\n“I don’t think any force right now in Afghanistan has the might of the Red Army.

Other protesters are seen “destroying posters of the country’s Supreme Leader and shouting, ‘Death to the dictator’.”\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWitnesses told CNN that many of the demonstrations that took place on Tuesday appeared to be “flash protests”, with groups forming and dispersing quickly to “avoid run-ins with Iran’s security forces”.\n\nWith the wave of protests showing little sign of abating, authorities have now restricted access to the internet. Activists have expressed concern that the shutdown “echoed a government move” before it took action against the 2019 fuel protests, when 1,500 people were killed, said Reuters.\n\nWhy are they happening?\n\nA photo widely circulated on social media showing Amini “lying comatose in a hospital” has become “the heart of a rallying cry for Iranians who want more freedoms and rights for women”, said NPR.\n\nAmini was a young Kurdish-Iranian woman on a visit to the capital Tehran last Tuesday when she was arrested by the morality police, a dedicated unit that enforces strict dress codes on women. The Financial Times reported that “she was accused of wearing tight trousers that contravened the republic’s obligatory Islamic dress codes for women”, which it added was confirmed by Tehran police on Monday.\n\nThe Times said that “credible reports suggest that she was beaten and sustained injuries to her head during her arrest”, which then led her to fall into a coma “from which she did not recover”.\n\nIranian authorities have denied she was killed while in police detention, suggesting that she suffered “sudden heart failure”, according to the BBC. But her family have said she did not suffer from any health conditions.\n\nHer death has since sparked an “outpouring of anger” over issues “ranging from freedoms in the Islamic Republic to the crippling economic impacts of sanctions”, said CNN.\n\nIs it a moment of reckoning for Iran?\n\nAmini’s death is “fast becoming another moment of reckoning for the Iranian regime that fears a popular revolt more than it fears staring down the rest of the world”, said Martin Chulov, The Guardian’s Middle East correspondent.\n\nAnd there are “some signs that a groundswell could be taking shape”, said Chulov, the most significant of its kind since the death of another young woman, Neda Agha Soltan, who was shot by a sniper as she attended an anti-government protest in June 2009. The “broad uprising” that took place then “nearly escaped the state’s control”.\n\nWhether Amini’s death will “become another seminal moment in the pursuit of self-determination by so many Iranians, or an ember that eventually cools, remains to be seen”, Chulov continued. But “Iranian leaders fear a street they can no longer contain” and the “brutal death of another young woman is the recipe for more unrest”.\n\nAmini’s death has “dealt new wounds to a deeply scarred nation”, wrote Najmeh Bozorgmehr, the Financial Times’ Tehran correspondent. “The final photograph of her, comatose in a hospital bed just days before she died, is all too resonant of a reminder of the dangers facing Iranian women.”\n\nBut the “tragedy of her death” could prove costly to the Iranian regime, which many now believe has “overstretched its enforcement of the Islamic dress code in an effort to hold back the tide of secular modernity”.\n\nAnd while Iranians are aware that this week’s protests will not end the obligation for women to wear the hijab, “people are now emboldened to speak out against harsh enforcement”.\n\nFor now, authorities are being “careful”, with “hardly any senior politicians” defending Amini’s arrest. “Some conservative and hardline members of parliament even believe that apprehending women in the street should end for good,” said Bozorgmehr.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/953872/fall-of-kabul-the-return-of-the-taliban", "title": "The return of the Taliban | The Week", "text": "The speed of events in Afghanistan has “stunned the world”, said Ido Vock in the New Statesman. Many had predicted that the Taliban, despite its inferiority in numbers (80,000 militants against 300,000 US-trained Afghan soldiers), would eventually take control of much of the country. But few expected it to happen before the US had even completed its troop withdrawal on 31 August. On Sunday, the Taliban ended a week of lightning advances across the country by claiming control of the capital, Kabul, hours after President Ashraf Ghani had fled abroad. The insurgents’ victory led to panicked scenes in the city, said Emma Graham-Harrison in The Guardian. Thousands of people descended on the airport, where several died while trying to cling to departing planes. Western embassies set about hastily evacuating staff and destroying documents. Many women, meanwhile, rushed to buy burqas or to go into hiding.\n\nPresident Biden admitted that the Taliban victory had come much quicker than anticipated, but said he stood “squarely behind” the decision to pull out. He blamed the swift collapse of the Afghan government on the unwillingness of the country’s army to stand and fight in the face of the Taliban advance. For its part, the Taliban, in its first press conference this week, sought to reassure opponents that it would be a responsible government. “We don’t want any internal or external enemies,” said the group’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid. He insisted that no retribution would be sought against those who worked for the former government, and that women would enjoy full rights “within the framework of Islam”. Today’s Taliban, he said, was very different to the one of 20 years ago.\n\nThat’s not what people on the ground are reporting, said Borzou Daragahi in The Independent. Afghans who fled to Kabul from areas previously captured by the Taliban have reported “massacres of civilians, summary executions of captured soldiers, and demands that unmarried women be handed over to fighters as spoils of war”. The Taliban’s promise of a new “open, inclusive Islamic government” is hard to take seriously, agreed Suzanne Moore in The Daily Telegraph. When it last held power, between 1996 and 2001, it ran a brutal regime that treated women as “less than human”. The US invasion changed that. The share of girls attending secondary school rose from 6% in 2003 to 39% in 2017, by which time there were 100,000 female students at university. Between 2001 and 2017, women’s life expectancy increased from 56 to 66. About 20% of civil servants are women. All those gains are now at risk owing to the West’s abandonment of the Afghans.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

Women’s rights will be erased and the country will once again become a base for terror groups, as it was in the 1990s (when an estimated 20,000 recruits from around the world passed through al-Qa’eda training camps there). The US is hoping the Taliban will be deterred from harbouring terrorists by the prospect of punitive bombing raids, but that didn’t work before. The Taliban refused to hand over Osama bin Laden even after those huge “daisy cutter” bombs were dropped on the Tora Bora mountains in 2001. The terror threat has certainly increased, said Shabnam Nasimi in The Daily Telegraph. Thousands of extremists were set free from prison during the Taliban advance, including the 5,000 “highest value” Taliban, al-Qa’eda and Islamic State fighters held at Bagram air base. “They are vanishingly unlikely to be preparing to go back to their families.”\n\nThere’s little evidence that the Taliban has changed its hardline views over the past 20 years, said Raffaello Pantucci in The Telegraph, but it has become a little more pragmatic. It’s aware that it’s taking over a changed Afghanistan. When the group last took power in 1996, it was offering a sense of basic justice to a country racked by “rampant warlordism”. The nation is in a better state today, and the Taliban will be judged harshly if it lets things slip back. To continue rebuilding, it will also require more aid and support from the West. The Taliban does seem to be adopting more moderate policies in the hope of securing local and international legitimacy, agreed Aris Roussinos on UnHerd. The group has assured Shia Muslims that they’ll be allowed to worship openly, and has appointed an ethnic Hazara governor for the Shia ethnic Hazara Bamiyan region. Whether it sticks with this approach or reverts to “totalitarian excess”, the fate of Afghanistan is now out of the West’s hands.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/20"}]}

The council said Iraqi authorities had received a request from the United States to assist in the investigation of the terror attack that occurred in the early hours of January 1.\n\nFollowing an investigation and evidence analysis, Baghdad’s Al-Karkh Investigative Court identified the suspect as a member of ISIS's external operations office and later detained him in Iraq, according to the council. The council added that the suspect will be put on trial under Iraq's anti-terrorism law and the country's \"commitment to international cooperation to combat terrorism and enhance global security.\"\n\nThe arrest was first reported on April 27 by Al Arabiya, a state-owned news television channel based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reiterated on April 29 that it believes the man who rammed his truck into crowds of revelers on New Orleans' famed Bourbon Street acted alone, NOLA.com and CBS News reported. The agency previously identified the driver as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, an Army veteran and U.S.-born citizen from Texas.\n\n\"While we continue to work with our law enforcement partners, both in the U.S. and internationally, based on the information to date, we continue to believe that Shamsud Din-Jabbar acted alone in carrying out the attack on Bourbon Street,\" the FBI said in a statement, according to NOLA.com and CBS News.\n\nThe investigation into the attack remains ongoing, the agency said. The FBI did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nDuring an April 29 news conference announcing an economic development project, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he had been briefed on the arrest in Iraq and directed questions to the FBI's field office in New Orleans.\n\n\"This goes to show you the resiliency of the state and the commitment that our law enforcement partners, whether they be at the federal, state, or local level, have in making sure that we’re safe in Louisiana,\" Landry added.\n\nState Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement on X that she was \"grateful to see this action.\"\n\n\"The (FBI) has been working with our partners across the globe to ensure we get answers and justice for the victims of this horrific tragedy,\" Murrill said.\n\nFBI: New Orleans truck attack suspect was inspired by ISIS\n\nFBI officials previously said they believed Jabbar acted alone to execute a premeditated \"act of terrorism.\" According to officials, he was inspired by ISIS to carry out the assault that occurred shortly after 3 a.m. on New Year's Day.\n\nThe FBI said Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police after he plowed his pick-up truck into the New Year's Day crowd, killing 14 people and wounding at least 57 others. Authorities have said the death toll could have been higher after law enforcement recovered two explosive devices hidden in coolers near the scene. The explosive devices did not detonate.\n\nHours before the attack, the FBI said Jabbar posted five videos on an online platform \"proclaiming his support for ISIS.\" Further evidence obtained in the investigation also indicated that Jabbar \"became a more devout Muslim in 2022,\" according to the FBI.\n\n\"During this time, Jabbar began isolating himself from society,\" the FBI added. \"Around the spring of 2024, Jabbar began following extremist views.\"\n\nFederal agents have been following leads in several states and other countries, according to the FBI. The agency revealed just days after the attack that Jabbar had previously visited Egypt, Canada, Florida, and Georgia.\n\nHe also made at least two trips to New Orleans in the months before the attack and searched for information about a similar incident at a Christmas market in Germany in December 2024, in which a man deliberately drove into a crowd, killing six people and injuring more than 200 others.\n\nCheap and deadly: Why vehicle terror attacks like the Bourbon Street ramming are on the rise\n\nISIS presence in Iraq and other countries\n\nThough ISIS was largely defeated in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria in 2019 by a U.S.-led military campaign, the militant group has been operating in the shadows with sleeper cells that launch attacks in both countries and other areas across the world.\n\n\"Despite losing many of its leaders and its territory, ISIS remains capable of conducting insurgent operations in Iraq and Syria while overseeing at least 19 branches and networks in Africa, Asia, and Europe,\" according to the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nThe group was once based in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul, and had tens of thousands of fighters from numerous countries. As of 2024, the United Nations estimates that the group has about 10,000 fighters, according to Reuters.\n\nKey foreign fighters for the group fled Iraq for neighboring countries, such as Afghanistan, Syria, and Pakistan.

She said she will welcome President Joe Biden to the city Monday and will ask that a tactical expert be sent to New Orleans to recommend \"target hardening measures\" to ensure safety during upcoming national events such as the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras.\n\nCantrell said security upgrades ahead of the Super Bowl, scheduled for Feb. 9, will begin Monday.\n\n\"Our mission remains to increase public safety as we move toward hosting major events in New Orleans,\" Cantrell said.\n\nDay of mourning set for each victim\n\nGov. Jeff Landry said he has spoken with family members of all 14 of those killed. Each victim will have a separate day of mourning from Monday through Jan. 23, Landry said, and families of those killed are being offered the state police escorts of the remains of their loved ones to local locations.\n\n\"We will continue to ensure that their tragic loss is not forgotten,\" Landry said. \"We are committed to doing everything within our power to honor these victims, their families and friends.\"\n\nChristopher Raia, the FBI deputy assistant director of the agency’s Counterterrorism Division, said the investigation continues to indicate the killer acted alone. More than 1,000 tips are being reviewed, and local, state and federal authorities will leave \"no stone unturned\" in efforts to learn everything about the killer and the attack, he said.\n\n\"We do this for the victims and their families, even though we know nothing we can do can take away their pain and grief,\" Raia said.\n\nWhat to know about the victims: Memorials, tributes and donations pour in for New Orleans attack victims\n\nBiden to visit New Orleans on Monday\n\nThe president and first lady Jill Biden will travel to New Orleans on Monday to grieve with families and community members and talk to local officials, the White House has announced. Monday also marks the start of Carnival, which in Louisiana means weeks of parades, eating king cakes and crafting beads with the green, purple and gold color scheme ahead of Mardi Gras − French for \"Fat Tuesday.\" The following day, Ash Wednesday, is the beginning of the holy season of Lent.\n\nLaw enforcement concerned: Official worry over copycat vehicle attacks\n\nAs Carnival starts Monday, several parades are scheduled\n\nThe most notable Carnival festivities are held in New Orleans, where Mardi Gras Day is an official holiday that the city has celebrated for centuries. At least six parades remain scheduled Monday, including two in the French Quarter neighborhood near where the attack took place on Bourbon Street.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, Anthony Robledo and Olivia Munson\n\nOn city streets: In wake of terror attack, the music is back on in New Orleans", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/02/new-orleans-trump-blames-terrorism-open-borders/77400631007/", "title": "After New Orleans, Trump blames 'Islamic terrorism' on 'open borders'", "text": "Jan. 2, 2025 Updated Jan. 3, 2025, 8:02 a.m. ET\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and a top adviser appeared to blame immigration for the New Year's Eve massacre in New Orleans, linking 'radical Islamic terrorism' to one of his top political priorities.\n\nFederal investigators said the suspect in the New Orleans attack, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who killed 14 people and left dozens injured was a Texas-born U.S. citizen and Army veteran.\n\nPolice fatally shot Jabbar after he rammed a truck carrying an ISIS flag into a crowd of New Year's Eve revelers on Bourbon Street early Wednesday.\n\nDeputy Assistant FBI Director Christopher Raia on Thursday said investigators believe Jabbar acted alone to execute a premeditated \"act of terrorism\" that was \"100% inspired by ISIS,\" referring to the Islamic State terrorist organization.\n\nTrump turns to immigration\n\nAs of mid-Thursday, federal investigators hadn't drawn any links between the New Orleans terror suspect and the U.S.-Mexico border or immigration.\n\nBut in posts on his social network Truth Social in the wake of the attack, Trump linked the massacre to \"criminals coming in\" and drew links between \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and immigration.\n\nBlaming what he called President Joe Biden's \"open borders\" policy, Trump said, \"Radical Islamic Terrorism, and other forms of violent crime, will become so bad in America that it will become hard to even imagine or believe.\"\n\n\"That time has come only worse than ever imagined,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump transition team didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump has frequently blamed immigration for a perceived increase in crime, amplifying heinous acts committed by immigrants and occasionally spreading false information tying immigrants to disorder, all to boost his signature campaign promise: cracking down on illegal immigration.\n\nA mistaken news report\n\n“It’s using tragedy and a serious problem to further his political agenda,” said Naureen Shah, an attorney at the ACLU. “He thinks vilifying immigrants is his blank check to cash, and in many ways he has been vindicated in his misuse of the facts.”\n\nThe immigration narrative got an early boost after FOX News, citing anonymous sources, erroneously reported Wednesday that the New Orleans suspect may have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump quickly blamed \"the criminals coming in\" before FOX corrected its reporting. The statement remained on Trump's Truth Social feed and on Trump transition Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s X account on Thursday.\n\n“When I said that criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our own country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake New Media, but it turned out to be true,” Trump said in the statement.\n\nNew Orleans killer declared his support for ISIS\n\nRaia, of the FBI, said 42-year-old Jabbar drove from Houston, where he lived, to New Orleans on Tuesday, Dec. 31. Shortly before the attack, Jabbar posted five videos on an online platform \"proclaiming his support for ISIS,\" Raia said.\n\nThe extremist group known as ISIS peaked as a fighting force overseas about a decade ago. It grew out of Al Qaeda elements who fought an insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq and later claimed it wanted to establish an Islamist caliphate across parts of the Middle East.\n\nTrump's musings followed a post late Wednesday by aide Stephen Miller, his incoming deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security adviser, drawing connections between \"Islamist terrorism\" and immigration.\n\n\"Islamist terrorism is an import,\" Miller posted on X. \"It is not 'homegrown.' It did not exist here before migration brought it here.\"\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, which bills itself as the country's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, denounced the violence in New Orleans.\n\n\"We strongly denounce this crime, we stand in solidarity with the people of New Orleans, we encourage anyone with relevant information to come forward immediately, and we pray for a full recovery of those impacted by this crime,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nAmong the victims was Kareem Badawi, a Muslim American native of Baton Rouge and a student at the University of Alabama, CAIR said.\n\n\"No one should rush to use a horrific crime like the New Orleans attack to advance a political agenda,\" said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, CAIR national deputy director.\n\nThere are about 3 million Muslims of all ages in the U.S., accounting for about 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by Pew Research.\n\nA majority of Muslim adults – 58% – are immigrants, a population that expanded after the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act reduced restrictions on immigration from Asia, Africa and other regions outside Europe.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump promised to \"bring back the travel ban\" that targeted Muslim-majority nations. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld a modified version of the ban, though Biden later ended the travel restrictions.\n\nJoey Garrison and Kim Hjelmgaard contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/02/new-orleans-attack-suspect-shamsud-din-jabbar/77396433007/", "title": "New Orleans attack: What we know about suspect Shamsud-Din ...", "text": "Updated Jan. 2, 2025, 6:17 p.m. ET\n\nA day after 14 people were killed in an attack in the French Quarter of New Orleans, chilling details began to emerge about the man who plowed a pickup into revelers on Bourbon Street in what the FBI is calling \"an act of terrorism.\"\n\nAuthorities say Shamsud-Din Jabbar, 42, rented a truck and rammed it into crowds celebrating New Year's in the bustling tourist district, killing at least 14 and injuring dozens more before he was shot dead in a gunfight with law enforcement. An Islamic State flag was recovered from the truck, which also carried weapons and what appeared to be an improvised explosive device.\n\nThe FBI said Jabbar, a U.S. citizen born in Texas, posted videos on social media shortly before the attack saying he was inspired by ISIS and decided to attempt the mass killing in New Orleans after initially planning to harm his family and friends. The U.S. Army veteran had grown increasingly withdrawn and devout in his Muslim faith, according to family and friends.\n\nJabbar was twice divorced, according to court records. In 2020, during his second divorce, a judge granted Jabbar's ex-wife a restraining order and Jabbar wrote about severe financial difficulties despite holding a $120,000-a-year job at Deloitte, records say.\n\nDeputy Assistant FBI Director Christopher Raia on Thursday said investigators are focusing on Jabbar's \"path to radicalization\" and what led him to carry out the deadly attack on New Year's Day.\n\nHere's what we know about Jabbar:\n\nLive updates: Search intensifies for other suspects in New Orleans truck attack\n\nJabbar initially planned to harm family and friends, FBI says\n\nRaia said Jabbar posted videos on Facebook as he headed to New Orleans in which he \"proclaimed his support for ISIS.\"\n\nRaia said there were five videos posted on Jabbar’s Facebook account before the attack. In the first video, Jabbar said he originally planned “to harm his family and friends” but was “concerned the news headlines would not focus on the ‘war between the believers and the disbelievers,’” Raia said.\n\nJabbar stated he had joined ISIS “before this summer” and also provided a will and testament, Raia said.\n\n\"Let me be very clear about this point: This was an act of terrorism,” Raia said. “It was premeditated and an evil act.\"\n\nRaia added that the attack was \"100% inspired by ISIS\" and said investigators are digging through more of Jabbar's social media accounts and interviewing more of his relatives and friends.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar's neighbor says suspect was quiet, 'non-violent'\n\nOne of Jabbar's neighbors in northern Houston said he saw the Army veteran loading up a white pickup truck with \"hand-held items\" on the morning of New Year's Eve.It did not raise his suspicions because Jabbar was a quiet, calm and “non-violent” neighbor who moved into the predominantly Muslim neighborhood more than a year ago, the man, who asked not to be named for fear of jeopardizing his family's safety, told USA TODAY Network reporters.“He was quiet. Not (a) bother (to) anybody. Not touching anybody. I have a family, so I would have been afraid for that type of person to be here,” the neighbor said.\n\nJabbar had recently told him he planned on moving to Louisiana.\n\n– John Oliva and Karoline Leonard\n\nMember of suspect's family in shock over New Orleans attack\n\nOne of Jabbar's relatives, who did not wish to be identified citing safety concerns, told USA TODAY, “I don’t think he did this of his own free will.”\n\n“I could never see him doing that,” said the family member. “Maybe he just went… If he did do he may have just went crazy. I just don’t see it happening.”\n\nThe family member said the Jabbar family is “doing all right,” but they are still in shock over the events in New Orleans.\n\n– Phaedra Trethan\n\nFriend, neighbor remember Jabbar: 'He was no terrorist to me'\n\nFriends of Jabbar described the Army veteran as a kind man and said there were little signs that he would be capable of carrying out such a deadly attack.\n\nChris Pousson first met Jabbar at a middle school in Beaumont, Texas. The pair were friends through high school but lost contact when Jabbar enlisted in the Army and he joined the Air Force, Pousson told NBC News. He described Jabbar as \"very quiet, very reserved, smart, articulate.\"\n\nThe two reconnected in 2017 and 2018, and Pousson kept up with his old friend on social media, he told the outlet. Jabbar's posts on social media grew increasingly focused on his faith. \"It was always positive — peace be with you, uplifting type of stuff,\" Pousson told the outlet, adding: \"What happened today was a complete 180 of anything I ever knew about him.\"\n\nMarilyn Bradford, a woman who lived above Jabbar in an apartment complex in Houston, said he would help her carry her groceries and had seen him spending time with his children on the weekends. \"He was no terrorist to me,\" she told the New York Times.\n\nFamily members, friends comment on Jabbar's faith\n\nDwayne Marsh, who is married to Jabbar's ex-wife, told the New York Times Jabbar had been acting increasingly erratic in recent months, causing Marsh and his wife to stop allowing the two daughters she shared with Jabbar to see him.\n\nMarsh told the outlet Jabbar was “being all crazy, cutting his hair” after converting to Islam, the Times reported.\n\nJabbar's brother, Abdur Jabbar, told the New York Times he had last spoken with his brother two weeks ago and that he didn't mention New Orleans or any intention of carrying out an attack.\n\nHe said they were brought up Christian but Jabbar converted to Islam long ago. “As far as I know he was a Muslim for most of his life,” the younger Jabbar told the New York Times. “What he did does not represent Islam. This is more some type of radicalization, not religion.”\n\nIn Houston, a neighborhood takes stock\n\nJabbar's street as well as the surrounding area has a large Muslim and Middle Eastern presence. Houston itself has the largest Muslim population in Texas and in the Southern U.S.\n\nRamadan Khairallah, who is a manager at Ramadan Halal Meat Market a few miles from Jabbar's residence, told USA TODAY reporters he is not worried about backlash hurting the community.\n\n\"I'm not concerned to be honest with you,\" Khairallah said.\n\nThere have been anti-Muslim incidents in the area in the past, including at some nearby Halal stores and other businesses, he said. But it’s not something he worries about after the attack in New Orleans. \"The people that are around us and stuff, there's nothing to be concerned about from them,” Khairallah said. “Nothing but positive energy in here.\"\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar joined the Army, was deployed to Afghanistan\n\nJabbar enlisted in the Army in 2007, at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan when more than 100,000 U.S. troops had deployed to war zones, according to the Army and a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHis initial specialty was a human resource specialist, a job whose duties included payroll, mail delivery and processing medals. He became an information technology specialist, a common transition in the Army. As an IT solider, he would have been a trained as a computer-system troubleshooter.\n\nJabbar deployed to Afghanistan in Feb. 2009. Subsequently, he was posted at bases including Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska, and what was then Fort Bragg in North Carolina.\n\nAfter his deployment, Jabbar joined the Army Reserve and continued serving as an IT specialist until July 2020. He left the Army as a staff sergeant, and received an honorable discharge, according to the official.\n\nNew Orleans attack suspect pleaded guilty to drunken driving at military base\n\nJabbar in 2015 pled guilty to a drunk driving charge after prosecutors say he was driving impaired inside one of the Army's largest military instillations, court records say.\n\nAccording to a charging document, Jabbar was found in November 2014 driving over the legal limit and with an open container of alcohol within the Fort Liberty Military Reservation, formerly known as Fort Bragg.\n\nFort Liberty, just west of Fayetteville, North Carolina, has about 55,000 military service members and employs about 12,000 civilian personnel, according to an Army website.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a Level 5 DWI charge in May 2015, records say. He was placed under probation, paid a $200 fine, surrendered his driver's license, had to complete 24 hours worth of community service and participate in an alcohol rehabilitation program, according to court records.\n\nIn 2005, he was charged with driving with an invalid license in Texas, records say. Three years earlier, he was charged with a property theft misdemeanor.\n\nNew Orleans attack suspect graduated from Georgia State University\n\nJabbar graduated from Georgia State University with a degree in computer information systems, according to the university.\n\nHe attended the 4-year university located in Atlanta from 2015 to 2017.\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar had financial woes despite lucrative job at Deloitte\n\nCourt records in Texas show Jabbar, who has been married and divorced twice, had written of financial troubles during his legal ups and downs with wives. As he negotiated his second divorce two years ago, his attorney attached records to court files indicating Jabbar’s finances were limited.\n\n“Time is of the essence. I cannot afford the house payment. It is past due in excess of $27,000 and in danger of foreclosure if we delay settling the divorce,” Jabbar wrote to his attorney in January 2022.\n\nJabbar proposed dividing the equity from the sale of the couple's home in Fresno, Texas. He also mentioned two real estate holding companies he formed that were worth $0, he wrote. He proposed $1,100 child support and mentioned his two children.\n\nLater, a detailed summary of Jabbar’s finances listed a paystub from Deloitte, the global accounting firm. He listed a gross salary of $120,000 per year. He listed credit card, student loan and other debts in excess of $41,000.\n\nJabbar's second wife filed a motion for a temporary restraining order in 2020, records show.\n\nDeloitte said in a statement that Jabbar filled a \"staff-level role\" and the company is \"shocked\" to learn he had \"any association with our firm.\"\n\n\"Like everyone, we are outraged by this shameful and senseless act of violence and are doing all we can to assist authorities in their investigation.”\n\nShamsud-Din Jabbar worked in real estate\n\nJabbar held a real estate license that expired in February 2023, according to the Texas Real Estate Commission.\n\nIn a video posted on YouTube, which has since been deleted, a man with the same name as the suspect said his time in the military taught him the “meaning of great service” and “what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously.”\n\n“I've taken those skills and applied them to my career as a real estate agent, where I feel like what really sets me apart from other agents is my ability to be able to one be a fierce negotiator,\" he said.\n\nThe company mentioned in the video, Blue Meadow Properties, lost its real estate license in 2022 when it expired.\n\n(This story was updated to add additional information.)\n\nContributing: Claire Thornton and Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/02"}]}

Having named a majority of traditional cabinet department heads and tapped tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramasway, to lead a new proposed \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" he is setting up the wealthiest presidential administration in U.S. history.\n\nIf the U.S. Senate confirms his picks, he will easily beat his own record. His first cabinet had one billionaire, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and a combined net worth of about $2 billion, according to Business Insider.\n\nWhen Trump ran in 2016, he campaigned on the idea he would run the country like a business. Many of his picks this year, while controversial, line up with that approach and his rhetoric promising to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington.\n\nSeveral potential members of his second administration face criticism for a lack of bureaucratic expertise relevant to the department they would oversee. They have instead thrived in the private sector and experienced entrepreneurial success.\n\nHere is a look at the ultra-wealthy people Trump has tapped for his second administration so far:\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nTrump said he would nominate North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the U.S. Department of the Interior, overseeing federal land including national parks and commitments involving native tribes.\n\nThe two-term Republican governor and businessman got rich in tech after selling software company Great Plains to Microsoft for more than $1.1 billion in 2001. He continued to sell Microsoft stock until he left the company in 2007 and has made several lucrative business deals since, according to Forbes, but his exact net worth today is unlisted.\n\nIn an April appearance on Fox News, Burgum said billionaires should support Trump if they care about their shareholders and family.\n\nHoward Lutnick\n\nTrump named his new commerce secretary, tapping his transition team co-chair and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick for the role.\n\nLutnick's net worth is estimated to exceed $1.5 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is due in large part to his majority ownership of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm.\n\nLinda McMahon\n\nTrump plans to nominate former Small Business Administration head and former wrestling executive Linda McMahon to lead the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nShe shares an estimated $2.5 billion net worth with her husband Vincent McMahon, according to Forbes. Together, they founded World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE.\n\nElon Musk\n\nTrump said he intends to tap tech CEO Elon Musk to co-lead the new \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" or DOGE.\n\nForbes labels Musk the richest person in the world and estimates his net worth at $315.7 billion as of Nov. 21. Musk's constellation of multibillion-dollar businesses include SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, X, xAI, and The Boring Company.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nBiotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will join Musk to help lead DOGE, Trump announced in a statement the week after his victory.\n\nForbes reported Ramaswamy was worth more than $1 billion in early November. Other estimates place his net worth between $800 million and $1 billion. Ramaswamy made his fortune through investments and a stake in Roivant Sciences, a pharmaceutical company he founded in 2014.\n\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/14/trump-transition-live-updates/76270510007/", "title": "Trump transition recap: Trump taps RFK Jr. to lead HHS", "text": "Updated Nov. 14, 2024, 11:53 p.m. ET\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is still choosing his nominees for his second term in the White House − and making some surprising picks.\n\nTrump announced that he has tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has spread conspiracy theories about vaccines, the COVID-19 pandemic and more.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said he chose Matt Gaetz, the firebrand who has been a harsh critic of the Justice Department even as he was investigated by it, as attorney general.\n\nHe also tapped former congresswoman and Army veteran Tulsi Gabbard as his nominee for director of national intelligence, a cabinet-level post. Gabbard is a former Democrat who has become one of Trump's most vocal supporters.\n\nThere are still plenty of pivotal roles for Trump to fill as he prepares for a second term.\n\nHe'll even have full control of Congress in 2025 after Republicans managed to win enough seats to keep the House on Wednesday.\n\nKeep up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nTrump picks North Dakota Doug Burgum as secretary of Interior\n\nTrump plans to nominate North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to be his secretary of Interior, the president-elect announced Thursday evening at a gala.\n\nTrump teased the pick during a speech at Mar-a-Lago during an America First Policy Institute dinner, where he said he'd be appointing Burgum on Friday to a \"very big position.\" Moments later, Trump decided to let the news slip early, telling the crowd that he's picked Burgum to lead the Department of Interior.\n\nBurgum, a 68-year-old wealthy software executive, ran unsuccessfully against Trump for the Republican nomination last year, failing to generate much buzz and dropping out last December before voting got underway.\n\nBut he drew immediate interest from Trump, who appreciated Burgum's focus on fossil fuels and energy issues and his command on television. The Trump campaign increasingly dispatched Burgum to campaign rallies as a go-to speaker to tout a second Trump presidency and attack outgoing President Joe Biden. Burgum had been speculated as a possible contender for secretary of the Energy Department, which remains unfilled.\n\nThe Interior Department oversees federal land including national parks and monuments, and administers programs and federal commitments involving native tribes. North Dakota is home to five federally recognized native tribes.\n\nTrump picks former Republican Rep. Doug Collins to lead VA\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said Thursday he's nominating former Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia to be his secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs as he continues to quickly assemble his next administration.\n\nCollins, a former congressman from 2013 to 2021 and trusted Trump loyalist, is a chaplain of the United States Air Force Reserve Command. He served in the Iraq War in 2008.\n\n\"We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our Active Duty Servicemembers, Veterans, and Military Families to ensure they have the support they need,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump picks his criminal lawyer, Todd Blanche, as deputy attorney general\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump chose Todd Blanche, a lawyer who represented him aggressively in his New York hush money trial and in two federal criminal cases, to serve as deputy attorney general in his next administration.\n\nTrump chose Blanche to join former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who was picked to become attorney general. The deputy is a key administrative post in the Justice Department, helping formulate and implement policies while supervising agencies such as the FBI.\n\n– Bart Janson\n\nDonald Trump picks Jay Clayton, former SEC chair, for powerful U.S. attorney role\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said he has picked Jay Clayton, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first term, as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Clayton would lead one of the most important federal prosecutor offices in the country. It's the office that prosecuted one-time Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who's now one of Trump's most vocal foes. It also investigated Trump but did not bring charges over the hush money payments that eventually turned into his conviction in his New York state trial.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nDonald Trump picks Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead health agencies\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday said he has selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, who has spread conspiracy theories about vaccines, the COVID-19 pandemic and more, has been one of Trump's most vocal supporters in recent months, after ending his own independent presidential bid.\n\n\"The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country,\" Trump shared on Truth Social.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nNorth Dakota governor lauds Trump's 'pace' in appointments\n\nAt a Mar-a-Lago gala, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota swung by to talk to the press during mic checks.\n\nAsked about the flurry of announcements Trump has made over the last week, Burgum said he loved \"the pace\" and loved the movement.\n\nHe was asked if he had any interest in being chosen as an \"energy czar\" and said that it was \"not about any specific role.\" He said that Elon Musk had been at Mar-a-Lago Thursday.\n\nAsked more directly about a possible Secretary of the Interior position, Burgum responded, \"There's been a lot of discussion about a lot of different things.\"\n\nAs for Trump's decision to name Matt Gaetz as attorney general, he said, \"I think that the president is making very smart picks across the board. He's got his reasons for doing all these things.\"\n\nHe added that he thought President-elect Trump was \"picking people that will focus on driving real change, as opposed to incremental change.\"\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nRFK Jr., vaccines, food dyes, fluoride and why ‘Make America Healthy Again' took off\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a 2024 presidential candidate who has told supporters that Donald Trump “promised” to put him in charge of public health agencies, has vowed to “Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nThat messaging resonated with a large portion of voters who are worried about what's going into their food. On social media, moms and health-conscious influencers are repeating and reposting Kennedy's talking points, both those that may have merit and the ones that amount to disproven conspiracy theories.\n\nSo why did the \"Make America Healthy Again\" (#MAHA) slogan work so well? Americans are more health-focused than ever before, and there's a wealth of medical advice being doled out on social media — though most is not coming from credentialed experts.\n\nSome voters are also less trusting of government regulators, the anti-vaccine movement has regained momentum post-COVID, and people are fearful about the rise in cancer among young people.\n\n– Alyssa Goldberg\n\nMusk and Ramaswamy won't be paid to lead new Department of Government Efficiency, Musk says\n\nElon Musk said he and Vivek Ramaswamy will not be paid for leading the newly-created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMusk, the Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder, and Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate, were appointed to lead the new department, deemed DOGE for short, by President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Musk shared the compensation news in a response to a post made on his platform, X, by Sen.

The Attorney General oversees the Department of Justice and represents the United States in legal matters generally and gives advice and opinions to the President and to the heads of the executive departments of the Government when so requested, according to the Office of the Attorney General, and in matters of exceptional gravity or importance the Attorney General appears in person before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Department of Justice is the world's largest law and enforcement agency and includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), U.S. Marshalls Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and U.S. Attorneys.\n\n− Roseann Cattani\n\nDemocrats, GOP clash over release of Matt Gaetz ethics investigation\n\nA partisan standoff appears to be brewing over whether a House Ethics Committee report will be released before the Senate considers Donald Trump's nomination of Matt Gaetz for U.S. attorney general.\n\nGaetz, who resigned Wednesday shortly after his nomination, has been the subject of a three-year investigation by the panel over allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, accepting “improper gifts” and giving out special favors to individuals with whom he had relationships.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee, which expanded its probe in June to include additional allegations, was to decide on Friday whether to release its report, but his resignation effectively ended the investigation.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the panel's chairman, Michael Guest, R-Miss., told reporters as he left the floor that he did not plan to make the document public.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nMatt Gaetz's law experience: What to know about the attorney general pick's resume\n\nDonald Trump sent shockwaves through Washington on Wednesday when he named Matt Gaetz, former Congressman from Florida, as his pick for attorney general.\n\nGaetz resigned from the House of Representatives following the announcement. If confirmed by the Senate, Gaetz will head the Department of Justice. Both Gaetz and Trump have been the subject of investigations from the Justice Department, though Gaetz's ended without charges.\n\nHere's what to know about Gaetz's prior experience and his unique path to the DOJ.\n\nMatt Gaetz's law experience: What to know about the attorney general pick's resume\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nJack Smith to step down as special counsel investigating Trump, reports say\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, who brought two criminal cases against Trump, plans to step down before the president-elect takes office, the New York Times reported citing people familiar with Smith's plans. Smith and his team plan to finish their work and exit before Trump can make good his pledge to fire Smith within “two seconds” of being sworn in. CNN also reported the move, citing a Justice Department official familiar with the discussions.\n\nSmith's case involving classified documents Trump kept after leaving office was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida, but Smith's team has filed an appeal.\n\nIn a case in Washington charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, Smith asked for and received a monthlong pause to the filing deadlines. The Justice Department is working to determine how to proceed in both cases, but department policy has been against prosecuting sitting presidents.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nLara Trump is 'honored' at the thought of being appointed to the Senate\n\nLara Trump to replace U.S. Sen.

Bolton, who served for more than a year as national security adviser during Trump’s first term, called Trump’s choice of Gaetz as “the worst” Cabinet nomination in history.\n\n“John Bolton, who is a staggeringly dumb warmonger, being against someone is a great sign!” Musk fired back in a message on X. “Gaetz will be great.”\n\nMusk has landed a job of his own in the incoming Trump administration.

Gaetz’s resignation effectively ends that investigation.\n\nGaetz also was investigated by the Justice Department, which Trump has tapped him to lead, on suspicion of having sex with a 17-year-old girl and allegedly paying for her to travel with him.

Rubio, a Cuban American, would be the first Latino person to serve as Secretary of State.\n\nRubio has expressed support for Ukraine's war effort against Russia, but voted against additional aid for the country last year. He recently said the war in Ukraine is going to end with \"a negotiated settlement,\" something Trump has also supported. He's also advocated for a tough approach to American adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nTrump and Rubio, 53, ran against each other in the 2016 Republican primary, which turned nasty as they lobbed insults at each other.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later confirmed to reporters that Musk had officially joined the administration. The designation allows Musk to work for the federal government with or without compensation for a limited amount of time. He also received a government email and an office.

It was less than a year old.\n\nDOGE, as it became known, hasn't been run by Musk for months. He left earlier this summer after his feud with President Donald Trump erupted into public view.\n\nNow, the entity Musk led to overhaul the U.S. government in myriad cost-cutting ways has officially been disbanded. That's despite Trump's original intention that DOGE keep working until the middle of 2026.\n\nWhat to know: Donald Trump's DOGE is done after less than a year\n\nThe Director of the Office of Personnel Management Scott Kupor confirmed in a social media post on Nov. 23 that DOGE does \"not have centralized leadership.\" Reuters first reported the initiative no longer exists.\n\nCreated by Trump in his first day in office in January and helmed by Musk, DOGE upended many corners of the federal government in the first few months of the president's second term. Trump sold the effort as a follow-through on campaign promises to overhaul the government and slash the federal budget, which he and other MAGA and Republican allies criticized as wasteful and inefficient.\n\nDuring its tenure, DOGE seized control of information technology infrastructure, axed federal government contracts and pushed out or fired tens of thousands of workers across the country. But its splashiest raison d'être, to cut between $1 and $2 trillion dollars from the federal government's spending, failed to materialize.\n\nWhat was DOGE?\n\nTrump's executive order setting up the initiative described its goal as a reduction in spending and to eliminate \"waste, bloat, and insularity\" in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nIt came after Trump and Musk forged a close relationship during the 2024 presidential campaign and where the Tesla and Space X CEO poured more than a quarter-billion dollars into campaign committees supporting Trump, namely in the closing weeks of the White House race with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump first proposed a government efficiency commission in September 2024 at the Economic Club of New York. At the time, he said the commission would conduct \"a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government\" and recommend changes. Over the next few months, it morphed into a department, as Musk and Trump discussed the project in public interviews and campaign events.\n\nA week after Election Day, Trump officially announced the creation of DOGE, saying it could become \"the Manhattan Project of our time.\" Musk and fellow billionaire and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy were initially tapped as its leads, though Ramaswamy later dropped out of the initiative.\n\nIts acronym, DOGE, refers to Dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency that Musk supported. In 2023, he even temporarily changed the logo on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to the cryptocurrency's dog logo, triggering a spike in Dogecoin value.\n\nEven after Musk's exit in May, DOGE was intended to continue operations until the summer of 2026, under Trump's January executive order. But as of mid-November, it has had about a 10-month life span.\n\nWhat did DOGE do?\n\nWithin DOGE's first 100 days, it led layoffs and buyouts that left thousands of federal workers out of their jobs.\n\nStarting in February, DOGE and the administration undertook mass firings and buyouts of federal workers. The first round of firings came after buyouts were offered to all federal employees, which more than 75,000 workers accepted.

And we take a look at what's next for several major issues circling the Supreme Court.\n\n♦\n\nPresident-elect. Donald Trump continues to build his next administration, tapping trusted allies to serve as advisors and cabinet members. In one of his latest moves Trump announced he's nominating former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. Senator Marco Rubio is expected to be named the next secretary of state according to the New York Times and CNN. Rubio is the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and was a finalist to be Trump's running mate. He would be the first Latino to serve in the position.\n\n♦\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said yesterday, he's tapped tech billionaire, Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and former Republican presidential contender, Vivek Ramaswamy, to lead a new department of government efficiency that will work to slash federal government spending, waste and regulations. In other roles, Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a border patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ice director.

I spoke with USA TODAY national correspondent Will Carless for more. Will, thanks for making some time on this.\n\nWill Carless:\n\nThanks for having me on.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Will, let's just put this kind of in context before we get to the Trump part of this. How many people have been convicted and jailed for their actions on or related to January 6th, 2021? What have we seen in recent years?\n\nWill Carless:\n\nSo the number of people charged is over 1500 at this point, a lot of which have made plea deals or been convicted. A handful have been acquitted, but the final figure that I got from George Washington University was 663 people who have been jailed for January 6th, and there are still, as of today, 200 sitting in federal prisons. And that doesn't count people who have been sentenced to prison but haven't yet been assigned a facility or actually shown up for their sentence.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWow. Okay. So what has President-elect Donald Trump then said about pardoning some of these folks?\n\nWill Carless:\n\nWell, his rhetoric has become stronger and stronger in this regard. He's done his Trump thing where he'll sort of take it on and respond to questions, but never quite fully answer the question. So, for example, he was asked in August at a conference of black journalists whether he would pardon the January 6th rioters and he said, \"Absolutely I would.\" And then he sort of added, \"If they're innocent, I would pardon them.\" We of course, asked the Trump campaign, I've asked them twice, to sent them pretty detailed questions about who would be pardoned and why, and they've sent me back the same one sentence response in both cases, which simply says that \"President Trump will make decisions on a case-by-case basis.\" So not quite clear. I mean a lot of people think that he might be pressured into pardoning all the January 6th rioters. He may only do a handful, he may not do any, but he's certainly edging towards pardoning more rather than fewer, I would say.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. Well, will we know Trump rhetoric and action can be two different things. I mean, do we expect this as a reality during his administration? Can he do what he's claimed here? I mean, what do the legal experts say on this?\n\nWill Carless:\n\nWell, I'll put my analyst hat on for a second, but I think in this case I will sort of conglomerate what I've been told by people I've been talking to, and nobody's quite sure, but people do agree that he is in a pretty sticky situation if he chooses not to pardon anybody. Remember that Trump himself has spent the last, really four years, trying to rewrite history when it comes to January 6th, along with a slew of conservative talk show hosts and news anchors and influencers who have tried to pretend that January 6th was this sort of peaceful meeting of the minds and this protest that has been unjustly prosecuted by a biased FBI. As somebody who was there that day, I can tell you that's complete nonsense. You can watch the videos for yourselves. More than 150 police officers were injured. But nevertheless, that is the line. That is the story that Trump and others have spun up around the January 6th insurrection.\n\nAnd so if you follow that to its logical conclusion, here's a man who has power to pardon these people. His claim has been that they've done nothing wrong and that they've been impacted by an unfair judicial system and legal system. It stands to reason that he would follow through and say, right, we're going to let these people out. But as one of the people I talked to, Rachel Carroll Rivas, who heads the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center pointed out, there's a big difference between what politicians say on the campaign trail and what they actually enact once they get into power. And so it's possible that more moderate voices get to Trump and he decides not to do this. If he does pardon them then, as Rachel said, it really gives a strong indication as to how he plans to govern moving forwards if he lets all of these insurrectionists out of prison\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWill, if he were to undergo mass pardons in this way surrounding January 6th, what would this mean for the country's far right movements more broadly?\n\nWill Carless:\n\nThat's the real gist of my story, is that this is a movement that has had a lot of the oxygen sucked out of it over the last two or three or four years. Really, January 6th was a serious reckoning for America's far right extremist movement. You saw leaders from the movement, the really big powerful leaders, put in prison, a lot of them. And you saw what I like to refer to as the brands of the far right, particularly the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. You saw those brands lose a lot of their cachet and a lot of their power in the months and the years after January 6th and the prosecutions. And you also saw the far right in general really center a warning shot. Look, if you come out in public and you behave badly and you break laws, then the Justice Department will come after you federally and you will go to prison.\n\nSo a pardon or a series of pardons and sliding scale as to how big those pardons are and how many there are, would have many people think a corollary effect on that movement. It will send a message to America's far right that look, whatever you do, whether it's right down to seditious conspiracy and you're sent to prison for 22 years, it can be pardoned and we're okay with it and we are sending a message that we are supportive of that sort of action. And that is of serious concern to scholars and to watchers of America's far right, that they could be really emboldened by these pardons\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWill Carless covers extremism and emerging issues for USA TODAY. Thank you Will.\n\nWill Carless:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA New York Court has suspended all current deadlines in Trump's New York hush money case, including a scheduled November 26th sentencing on his 34 felony convictions. Judge Juan Merchan was scheduled to issue a decision yesterday on whether the Supreme Court's broad presidential immunity ruling means Trump's felony convictions must be tossed out. But the pause on the case until November 19th, which was made public yesterday, means that ruling will not come this week. It's unclear what the new decision to pause the current deadlines means for whether Trump will ever be sentenced. Merchan ordered prosecutors to provide an update on their views of how to proceed in the case in light of Trump's presidential election victory.\n\n♦\n\nA new Trump administration could change course on a number of Supreme Court cases. I spoke with USA TODAY's Supreme Court correspondent, Maureen Groppe, to break them down. Hello, Maureen.\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nHello, how are you?\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood. Good. Thanks for hopping back on The Excerpt today. So Maureen, we're beginning think about what a Trump win might mean for the Supreme Court and surrounding some key issues. Let's start with transgender care. What's the latest around some of these issues in the courts and how do we expect a new Trump term to influence them?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nWell, one of the most high profile cases the Supreme Court is considering this term is the constitutionality of measures that about half the states have taken to prevent transgender minors from receiving puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The Biden administration challenged Tennessee's ban and the Supreme Court is set to hear all oral arguments in that case next month, but it could be months after that, before the Supreme Court issues its opinion. And before they do, the Trump administration could tell the court that the Justice Department has changed positions. That would be unusual to happen after the case has been argued. But Trump made opposition to transgender rights a central theme to his campaign so we'll have to see what he wants to do about this.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMaureen, we know the issue of abortion has become a major debate across the country. It could be headed back to the justices. What's the expectation here?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nOne abortion issue that could come back to the court is the Biden administration's challenge to Idaho's strict abortion ban. The administration says that that ban conflicts with a federal law that requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing care, which includes abortions if those are needed to prevent serious health consequences. This issue came before the Supreme Court earlier this year, but the justices sent it back to the Appeals Court for further review. And if the Appeals Court sides with the Biden administration, the Trump administration could just drop the challenge if Idaho appeals that decision to the Supreme Court\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd as the country continues to grapple with gun violence, so-called ghost guns have been at the center of a lot of debates. What's next here, Maureen and what might be the Trump administration's influence?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nSo the ghost guns are weapons that are put together from kits that don't have serial numbers. And people who buy the kits don't have to pass background checks, or at least they didn't have to do that the way they do with the fully manufactured gun until the Biden administration changed that. The Supreme Court heard a challenge to those regulations last month. And this case is not about the Second Amendment, but whether the administration correctly applied existing law to regulate these weapons. And it actually sounded like the justices might be willing to uphold the rules, but even if they do, the Trump administration could just repeal the rules once Trump takes office. We don't know if he's going to do that or not. The gun rights groups are expecting him to do that based on promises that they say that he made to them about undoing various gun regulations. But we don't know for sure what the Trump administration will do.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs you outline in this piece, Maureen, we've already seen this kind of whiplash in the courts across the last few administrations from Trump to Biden. Now we're going back to Trump. How has this played out and what might this tell us about the next four years?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nThis change of positions doesn't happen on every case, but it can happen on some big ones. And the last time Trump was president, his Justice Department reversed positions on several issues and they still won those cases. The Biden administration did some of its own reversals when it took office. What we don't know is how much these switching positions matter. In other words, do the justices take them into account when they're deciding a case or would they make the same decision regardless? That's something we can't peek behind the curtain to know.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Maureen Groppe covers the Supreme Court for USA TODAY. Thank you, Maureen.\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA Massachusetts Air National Guard member was sentenced yesterday to 15 years in prison for violating the Espionage Act by sharing hundreds of classified documents on social media.

At the time, Democrats and some Republicans challenged Whitaker's interim appointment because he hadn't served in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nIn a July 2016 opinion piece for USA TODAY, Whitaker argued that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the Democratic presidential nominee, should have been indicted for how she handled classified documents on a private email server.\n\nTrump's picks so far: What we know\n\nHere are Trump's picks for key positions in his administration, as of Sunday night.\n\nWhat are the Cabinet positions?\n\nThe Cabinet advises the president on issues related to their respective offices.\n\nThese are the Cabinet positions from the 15 executive departments, which must be confirmed by the Senate:\n\nSecretary of State\n\nSecretary of Defense\n\nAttorney General\n\nSecretary of the Interior\n\nSecretary of Agriculture\n\nSecretary of Commerce\n\nSecretary of Labor\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services\n\nSecretary of Transportation\n\nSecretary of Energy\n\nSecretary of Education\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security\n\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\n\nSecretary of Treasury\n\nThe Cabinet and presidential advisers can also include the vice president, the chief of staff, the ambassador to the United Nations, the director of National Intelligence, the U.S. trade representative, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the head of the Small Business Administration.\n\nContributing: James Powel, Aysha Bagchi, Zac Anderson, Darren Samuelsohn, Dan Morrison, Karen Weintraub, Alyssa Goldberg, Tom Vanden Brook, David Jackson, Savannah Kuchar, Victor Hagan, Bart Jansen, Fernando Cervantes Jr., Riley Beggin, Michael Collins, Joey Garrison; Kaycee Sloan, the Cincinnati Enquirer; Jim Little; Pensacola News Journal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/18/elon-musk-company-value-doge/76402834007/", "title": "Musk's business are soaring since being tapped by Trump. Except ...", "text": "Updated Nov. 18, 2024, 12:55 p.m. ET\n\nAfter President-elect Donald Trump tapped Elon Musk to join him in his second administration, the tech billionaire's businesses are booming, with one exception.\n\nThe world's richest man, according to Forbes, will lead Trump's proposed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, alongside fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy. The pair made their fortunes in the private sector over the last several decades and played big roles in the former president's 2024 reelection campaign. This year, Musk fundraised for and promoted Trump while overseeing a constellation of six companies.\n\nMost have soared in value since Trump's victory. As of Nov. 18, he had an estimated net worth of $318 billion. Here is a look at every business Musk currently owns:\n\nTesla\n\nIn 2004, Musk began investing in Tesla, Inc., an automotive and energy company, known for its pioneering electric vehicles. Today, Musk serves as CEO of the car and battery storage manufacturer.\n\nTesla does significant business with the U.S. government, securing $41.9 million in federal contracts over the last 16 years.\n\nWith Musk expected to wield influence in Washington that could benefit the business, Tesla's market value jumped following Trump's win. The Friday after the election, its market value closed above $1 trillion for the first time in more than two years.\n\nSpaceX\n\nSpace Exploration Technologies Corp., better known as SpaceX, was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology. Musk serves as CEO of the business that designs, manufactures, and launches rockets and spacecrafts.\n\nSpaceX also does business with the U.S. government. Since 2008, it has benefited from nearly $19.8 billion in federal contracts. Fiscal year 2024 was the largest on record for SpaceX, aided by at least $3.8 billion in government contracts.\n\nThe aerospace company plans to launch a tender offer in December that would value it at more than $250 billion, Reuters reported. That valuation is up from an estimated $210 billion in June.\n\nNeuralink\n\nMusk founded Neuralink Corp., a neurotechnology company, in 2016. Neuralink develops implantable brain-computer interfaces that help people with paralysis.\n\nIn August, Musk announced a second person had received a Neuralink cybernetic implant after Noland Arbaugh became the first human to have the procedure earlier this year.\n\nThe company's valuation was estimated to be in the low billions and to have nearly doubled in the last year.\n\nX\n\nMusk purchased the social media platform Twitter and rebranded it to X in 2022. Musk used it to support Trump during his reelection campaign this year and promote DOGE last week.\n\nExploding Topics estimated the social media giant had about 600 million monthly users in October. As X became more political, users began fleeing to other apps. Bluesky, a social media alternative, saw a boom in new account creation after the election.\n\nA September filing by Fidelity Investment's Blue Chip Growth Fund implied X was valued at $9.4 billion — a steep decrease compared to the $44 billion Musk paid for Twitter in 2022.\n\nxAI\n\nIn 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial intelligence company known for its Grok chatbot accessible to X users.\n\nThe start-up recently attracted up to $6 billion in investments implying a valuation between $45 and $50 billion, according to reporting by CNBC and the Financial Times.\n\nThe Boring Company\n\nMusk founded The Boring Company in 2016 with the idea that cities could have networks of underground tunnels allowing motorists to zip between destinations with little time spent on the streets.\n\nTo help make that vision come to life, The Boring Company works to perfect and construct transportation, utility, and freight tunnels. As of October 2023, the business had an estimated valuation of more than $7 billion, Reuters reported.\n\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/18"}]}

The Dodgers lost the first two games in Minnesota against the Twins but fought back to tie the series before Koufax took over, spinning shutouts in both Games 5 and 7 to clinch it for Los Angeles.\n\n1958 Yankees: New York not only fell into an 0-2 hole against the Milwaukee Braves in this series, it also found itself trailing 3-1 after dropping Game 4.

Royalsreview.com, a Royals’ fan Web site published by SB Nation, ranks Wohlford at No. 86 in its list of the top 100 all-time Royal players.\n\nHe signed a free-agent contract with the San Francisco Giants following the 1979 season, and was known for being one of the National League’s better pinch-hitters and fourth outfielders during his three-year stint with the Giants.\n\n“I feel very proud that I got to play for both teams,” Wohlford said. “I played eight years in the American League and seven years in the National League, and a good time of that was spent with those two teams. It’s cool. A lot of people on the East Coast might be upset about this matchup, but I think it’s great. It’s two great teams. People in the American League better get used to the Royals. They’re going to be here for awhile, and they’re only going to get better.”\n\nWohlford is one of just three position players that have played in at least 200 games for the Giants and Royals — kudos to Sports Illustrated’s Tom Verducci, who also serves on Fox’s World Series broadcast team, for finding this informational nugget. The other two players are outfielder Michael Tucker and catcher Brent Mayne. Two pitchers appeared in 300 games for each team: Jeremy Affeldt, a key cog in the current Giants’ bullpen and San Diego Padres manager Bud Black.\n\nGame three of the World Series is today from San Francisco’s AT&T Park. Game time is 5:07 p.m, and will be aired on FOX.\n\n“I think it’s a great series,” Wohlford said. “They’re both great teams; they’re both very similar teams. They both have great pitching. The Royals have great young players that are coming into their own. Their bullpens are both very good. Royals have more speed, but the Giants have the edge experience-wise.”\n\nWohlford noted that this edition of the Royals has a strong resemblance from the Royals teams he played with in 1972-76 — offensive success was predicated on contact hitters and team speed, and a deep pitching staff that ranked second in earned run average in the American League.\n\n“A lot of good young players at that time were on the Royals: George Brett, Dennis Leonard, myself, Frank White, John Wathan, Willie Wilson, Jamie Quirk, Hal McRae, and a lot of homegrown talent,” Wohlford said.\n\n“We were good. Only problem was that there wasn’t a wild-card. The Oakland A’s won three straight World Series championships (1972-74). We were good. We just didn’t have the wild card back then.\n\nThe Royals did win the American League West in 1976, Wohlford’s last season with the Royals, and he played in all five games of a classic American League Championship Series between the Royals and Yankees (won by the Yankees, three games to two).\n\nWhile Wohlford is a fan of the Giants, you get the strong feeling that a big part of him is rooting for the Royals.\n\nWhich team is he pulling for?\n\n“Let’s put it this way, the Royals drafted me out of Visalia. I played five years there. They haven’t won in a long time. It wouldn’t hurt my feelings if the Royals won. I like them both. The Giants have treated me well,” Wohlford, who plans on being at Saturday’s Game 4, said. “It’s hard to root for just one team in this. It’s nice to see the Royals back after 29 years. They built a heck of a team. I love watching both teams play. Ned Yost was a teammate of mine in Milwaukee. I played against Bruce Bochy. Bochy handles his pitching staff so well. Both are very good managers.\n\n“I actually lived in Kansas City [full-time] in my five years there. I consider Kansas City my second home. I bought my first house there. The people are great. Kansas city and St. Louis are two great baseball cities. St. Louis has done very well over the years, but the Royals haven’t had that kind of luck. It’s great to see them have it this year. Great fans. And the Giants have great fans. It’s just a great [World Series] for me.”\n\nWohlford was originally drafted by the California Angels in the 11th round of the 1969 MLB draft, but the Mt. Whitney graduate did not sign with the Angels. He played baseball at COS, and was drafted in January 1970 by the Royals, and began his professional career in the Pioneer League in 1970.\n\nWohlford was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in a five-player trade during the 1976 MLB Winter Meetings, and he played three years with the Brewers before signing with the Giants.\n\nHis best year in the major was in 1984 with the Montreal Expos.\n\nWohlford hit .300 (.793 OPS) in 228 at-bats. He finished with a .260 career batting average.\n\nHow to watch\n\nThe Royals visit the Giants for Game 3 of the World Series at 5 p.m. tonight on FOX.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2025/11/01/dodgers-blue-jays-world-series-score-live-game-7-highlights/87038625007/", "title": "Dodgers vs Blue Jays World Series Game 7 score, highlights from ...", "text": "Nov. 1, 2025 Updated Nov. 2, 2025, 1:17 a.m. ET\n\nTORONTO – Perhaps now we know why it took a quarter-century for a Major League Baseball team to repeat as World Series champions. Now that the Los Angeles Dodgers have done it, we understand how harrowing, hair-raising and humbling a feat it really is.\n\nThese Dodgers took their repeat bid to the limit – Game 7 of the World Series against a talented Toronto Blue Jays team, down to their final two outs and looking for all the world like those three-peating New York Yankees from 1998-2000 would maintain their status in the baseball pantheon.\n\nAnd then Miguel Rojas stepped to the plate, a light-hitting utilityman when he climbed into the batter’s box, an October legend when he returned from his trip around the bases.\n\nRojas’s home run off Blue Jays closer Jeff Hoffman saved them from the brink, they survived a bases-loaded situation in the bottom of the ninth and their most underrated star, catcher Will Smith, finally delivered them the title so many expected.\n\nHis long home run to left field off Shane Bieber with two outs in the top of the 11th inning gave the Dodgers their first lead of the night, and Game 6 starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto stranded the tying run at third as the Dodgers secured a 5-4 victory and back-to-back championships.\n\nIt was their ninth title in franchise history, eighth since moving to Los Angeles and third in the past five years. Yet it also went from preordained – thanks to a superstar-studded roster and a total investment of half a billion dollars in payroll – to unlikely.\n\nAfter all, it was the Blue Jays who brought a 3-2 World Series lead back to Canada, nine innings from their first title since 1993.\n\nInstead, it was Smith, exhorting his baseball over the wall, screaming “Come on!” as it whistled over the wall.\n\nAnd it was Yamamoto, completing one of the gutsiest pitching performances in baseball history: Winning Games 2 and 6 as a starter, then pitching 2 ⅔ innings of scoreless relief on zero days rest to win Game 7.\n\nIt was Randy Johnson who ended the Yankees’ dynasty by winning 2001 Game 6 and then coming back a night later to win Game 7 in relief. It took a similarly unbelievable act from Yamamoto to do what those Yankees could – go back-to-back.\n\n— Gabe Lacques\n\nHere's how Game 7 unfolded in Toronto:\n\nWill Smith home run puts Dodgers up in 11th\n\nShane Bieber came in to pitch the 11th for the Blue Jays and retired the first two batters, getting Shohei Ohtani to break his bat for the second out. Then, Dodgers catcher Will Smith launched a solo home run to left field, what could be a World Series-winning blast in Game 7.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto tosses scoreless 10th for Dodgers\n\nSeranthony Dominguez escapes bases-loaded jam in 10th\n\nA Mookie Betts walk, Max Muncy Single and Teoscar Hernandez walk loaded the bases with one out in the top of the 10th, but the Dodgers couldn't scratch out a run.\n\nAndy Pages makes unbelievable catch to send Game 7 to extra innings\n\nTORONTO - This World Series Game 7 is going extra innings - and getting even more insane with every subsequent sequence.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers escaped a bases-loaded jam in the bottom of the ninth when Andy Pages - inserted into the game for defensive purposes moments earlier - staggered into the left center field gap and hauled in Ernie Clement's long fly ball that could have walked it off and crowned the Blue Jays.\n\nThe twist: Left fielder Kiké Hernandez had designs on the ball, too. But Pages is 6-1. Hernandez is 5-11. Tall man wins - and barely hung on to the ball as Hernandez tumbled to the warning track.\n\nOn to the 10th.\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto walks into a ninth-inning jam\n\nSome 27 hours after starting the Dodgers' Game 6 win, Yoshinobu Yamamoto is coming on in relief, replacing Blake Snell with runners on first and second and one out.\n\nMiguel Rojas home run ties Game 7\n\nTORONTO - Miguel Rojas, the afterthought addition to a struggling Los Angeles Dodgers lineup, hit one of the biggest World Series homers in franchise history to rescue the Dodgers - for now - in the top of the ninth in World Series Game 7.\n\nWith the Toronto Blue Jays just two outs away from clinching their first World Series championship since 1993, Rojas hammered a Jeff Hoffman pitch 387 feet out to left field, tying the winner-take-all battle 4-4 heading to the bottom of the ninth.\n\nYou like unlikely heroes? Welcome to Rojas. The valued utilityman in his second stint with the Dodgers hit just seven home runs this season.\n\nHe only cracked the World Series lineup because center fielder Andy Pages was struggling so mightily, the Dodgers opted to move Tommy Edman to the outfield and drop Rojas at the bottom of the lineup.\n\nGoodness, did he deliver, crushing a hanging Hoffman splitter out to left. Blake Snell will now attempt to suppress the Blue Jays in the bottom of the ninth.\n\nMax Muncy home run makes it 4-3\n\nThe Dodgers cut the Blue Jays' lead back to one run on Max Muncy's solo homer in the top of the eighth off Trey Yesavage.\n\nBlue Jays get another huge double play to end seventh\n\nTORONTO - Helmets are flying, rookies are flourishing, the first baseman is performing acrobatics and Rogers Centre is roaring.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays are six outs away from their first World Series since 1993.\n\nAndrés Giménez's double cashed in Ernie Clement with a crucial insurance run, Clement tossing his helmet to round third and sprawl across home plate as the Blue Jays took a 4-2 lead over the defending champion Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series.\n\nRookie Trey Yesavage made the margin stand up in his first relief appearance of his very young major league career. He walked Shohei Ohtani leading off the seventh, then retired the dangerous Will Smith on a fly ball to center field.\n\nThen, he induced a ground ball from All-Star Freddie Freeman. Vladimir Guerrero fielded the ball, made a difficult throw to second for one out and then scampered back to the bag to complete the gorgeous 3-6-3 double play.\n\nYesavage raised both arms in triumph. Guerrero jogged off the field, screaming to the heavens.\n\nThey're drawing ever closer in Toronto, a city ready to erupt.\n\nBlue Jays get crucial insurance run: Toronto 4, Dodgers 2 through six\n\nErnie Clement led off the bottom of the sixth with a single against Tyler Glasnow and then stole second. Andres Gimenez scorched a run-scoring double to right, extending Toronto's lead to 4-2 with nobody out. But Glasnow got George Springer, Nathan Lukes and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to escape further damage and send Game 7 to the seventh inning.\n\nHow to watch World Series Game 7: Dodgers-Blue Jays stream\n\nTV channel : FOX\n\n: FOX Live stream: Watch on Fubo\n\nMax Scherzer steps aside, Blue Jays lead 3-1 halfway through\n\nTORONTO — Max Scherzer exited to a roaring standing ovation. Louis Varland made sure the Blue Jays did not stay with him too long.\n\nIn a pivotal fifth-inning sequence in Game 7 of the World Series, Varland retired Will Smith and Freddie Freeman on fly balls to center field and the Blue Jays retained their 3-1 lead at the game's halfway point.\n\nScherzer, the 41-year-old aiming to win his third World Series championship, was pulled with one out in the fifth after giving up a single to No. 9 batter Miguel Rojas.\n\nVarland, setting a major league record with his 15th appearance this postseason, gave up a single to Shohei Ohtani, putting the tying runs aboard.\n\nBut he got the dangerous Smith and Freeman on fly balls, pumping his fist and heading toward the dugout even before the ball settled in center fielder Daulton Varsho's mitt.\n\nTORONTO - The World Series championship is at stake in Game 7, high enough stakes already. Yet that alone wasn't enough to prevent a benches-clearing incident in the bottom of the fourth inning.\n\nDodgers reliever Justin Wrobleski hit Andrés Giménez with a pitch with two outs, Giménez immediately dropping his bat and complaining to the lefty.\n\nAnd an already passively tense Game 7 suddenly turned aggressive.\n\nThe benches cleared, and several shoving matches broke out, as Dodgers first baseman Max Muncy restrained Wrobleski and the Blue Jays hopped over the third base dugout railing to join the fray.\n\nWrobleski's plunking of Giménez marked the sixth time Blue Jays batters had been hit in the World Series; the Dodgers have absorbed two hit-by-pitches. Giménez was also hit by lefty reliever Evan Dreyer in Game 4.\n\nThe tension between the dugouts had been brewing since the bottom of the first inning, when Dodgers starting pitcher and leadoff batter Shohei Ohtani took almost the entire between-innings break resting in the dugout. He emerged with about 40 seconds left and the countdown clock stopped.\n\nAfter that half inning, Blue Jays manager John Schneider conferred at length with homeplate umpire Jordan Baker. After Ohtani batted in the third, he remained in the dugout from the 3:10 mark at the coundown's start until 17 seconds remained.\n\nThe crowd booed. Homeplate umpire Jordan Baker said something to Ohtani. The clock stopped. As Springer stepped in, it'd been 4 minutes, 20 seconds since a pitch was last thrown. In a mid-inning interview with Fox Sports, Schneider called the delay \"egregious\" and that the umpires said they'd discuss the delay with Dodgers manager Dave Roberts\n\nThe point became moot when the Blue Jays chased Ohtani, the pitcher, from the game on Bo Bichette's three-run homer in the third.\n\nLouis Varland was warming in the Blue Jays bullpen, readying to relieve Max Scherzer. He dropped everything and led his bullpen mates to the infield.\n\nBoth benches were warned and the next batter, George Springer, drilled a ball off Wrobleski's foot, to the delight of the crowd. Wrobleski stayed in the game.\n\nDaulton Varsho catch saves Blue Jays but Dodgers make it 3-1\n\nTORONTO - Max Scherzer needed gallant efforts from his defense to escape the top of the fourth with the lead in World Series Game 7.\n\nThe 41-year-old found trouble his third time through the Dodgers order, giving up a double and single to Will Smith and Freddie Freeman, respectively, to start the inning, and a one-out walk to Max Muncy loaded the bases.\n\nBut center fielder Daulton Varsho made a remarkable catch on Teoscar Hernandez's 109.8 mph drive to center, snaring the ball just off the turf for a sacrifice fly and a huge second out.\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr., the first baseman far more spry than the casual observer imagined, then launched his body into foul ground to snare Tommy Edman's soft liner, ending the inning.\n\nIt was a remarkable risk-reward play by Varsho: Miss it, and the game is tied, a runner at third and just one out. But Varsho did not miss, and Scherzer escaped the fourth with the lead.\n\nBo Bichette home run knocks out Ohtani: Blue Jays 3, Dodgers 0\n\nTORONTO - Shohei Ohtani is not a mythical figure, but rather a real, live human being who simply does remarkable things on the baseball field.\n\nAnd the Toronto Blue Jays did not hesitate to ambush him in Game 7 of the World Series.\n\nPitching on three days' rest for the first time in his career, Ohtani looked wobbly from the start, and then Bo Bichette applied a lightning-fast knockout blow: A first-pitch, three-run homer that electrified Rogers Centre, gave the Blue Jays a 3-0 lead and a massive edge in this call-to-arms Game 7.\n\nIt exited the bat at 110 mph, Rogers Centre reaching an ear-splitting noise level before Bichette's first career postseason home run settled 442 feet away from home plate. The longtime Blue Jays cornerstone, hobbled by a knee injury that robbed him of the first two rounds of the playoffs, enjoyed the view, taking a few steps down the first base line before beginning his trot.\n\nIn a game of leverage, the Blue Jays have a massive advantage: Not only are they up 3-0, but starter Max Scherzer has required just 28 pitches to complete three innings. The Dodgers, meanwhile, burned Justin Wrobleski, their best lefty of late, to take after Ohtani in the third.\n\nSix innings to go. But a massive blast as the Blue Jays pursue their first title since 1993.\n\nThe home run gives Bichette a strong chance at World Series MVP honors. He's batting .350 (7 for 20) with a .958 OPS. And for now, he owns the biggest hit in the Fall Classic.\n\nShohei Ohtani escapes bases-loaded jam in second inning\n\nTORONTO - Shohei Ohtani survived the top of the second inning. Yet he can't be long for this Game 7 of the World Series. Can he?\n\nThe Blue Jays loaded the bases on the Dodgers' two-way superstar, forced him to throw 25 pitches, coaxed pitching coach Mark Prior out of the dugout for a calm-down session. Yet much like the late innings of Game 6, they could not cash in.\n\nOhtani summoned his reserves to fire a 99-mph fastball past Andrés Giménez, leaving the bases loaded and Game 7 scoreless through two innings.\n\nThe Blue Jays must be encouraged by how vulnerable Ohtani looks, pitching on three days' rest. Yet also thoroughly frustrated they are not leading this game. Bo Bichette drew a leadoff walk and Addison Barger drilled a single to right field. After a pair of popouts, an Ernie Clement single loaded the bases - but Bichette's bum knee prevented him from scoring on the play.\n\nGiven a reprieve, Ohtani blew a 1-2 pitch past Giménez. Threat over - but one team concerned, the other frustrated.\n\nMax Scherzer quickly through two innings\n\nTORONTO - Shohei Ohtani wobbled just a bit in his first inning of work in Game 7 of the World Series, but the Blue Jays could not make him fall down.\n\nGeorge Springer rifled a leadoff single against Ohtani, but the two-way superstar rallied to strike out Nathan Lukes on a split-finger fastball and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. looking on a full-count, 99.6 mph fastball.\n\nThe Blue Jays sent Springer on the pitch, a dubious decision given Springer is hobbled by both knee and side ailments and it wasn't too unlikely Ohtani would register a strikeout. Guerrero was caught looking and Springer stopped running two-thirds of the way there, perhaps caught off guard by homeplate umpire Adrian Johnson's deliberate strike three call.\n\nMeanwhile, Max Scherzer needed just 10 pitches to retire the side in each of the first two innings. Game 7 remains scoreless.\n\nShohei Ohtani leads off Game 7 with a hit\n\nShohei Ohtani singled to center field to lead off the top of the first against Max Scherzer and moved to second on a fielder's choice. But Scherzer got Freddie Freeman to fly out to center and Mookie Betts to ground out, stranding Ohtani in scoring position.\n\nWorld Series MVP odds\n\nOdds via BetMGM as of 8:25 p.m. ET, Friday\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr.: +100\n\nShohei Ohtani: +110\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto: +500\n\nStarting pitcher: Shohei Ohtani\n\nShohei Ohtani (L) P Will Smith (R) C Freddie Freeman (L) 1B Mookie Betts (R) SS Max Muncy (L) 3B Teoscar Hernández (R) RF Tommy Edman (S) CF Enrique Hernández (R) LF Miguel Rojas (R) 2B\n\nStarting pitcher: Max Scherzer\n\nGeorge Springer (R) DH Nathan Lukes (L) LF Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (R) 1B Bo Bichette (R) 2B Addison Barger (L) RF Alejandro Kirk (R) C Daulton Varsho (L) CF Ernie Clement (R) 3B Andrés Giménez (L) SS\n\nTORONTO — For better or worse, Game 7 of this World Series won't just be about determining a champion between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays.It will also determine, for better or worse, right or wrong, the legacies of the participants.\n\nAlas, today's ring culture can make perception reality.

The tournament begins on Wednesday, Aug. 13, with the world championship set for Saturday, Aug. 24, at 3 p.m.\n\nLittle League Baseball has some unique rules. From managing pitch counts to smaller fields, let's break down some regulations that are bound to pop up during the World Series.\n\nWhat ages play in the Little League World Series?\n\nPlayers aged 10-12 are eligible to play in the Little League World Series.\n\nUntil 2018, players who turned 13 during the summer were still allowed to play, but 13-year-olds are no longer eligible to play.\n\nHow does the LLWS tournament format work?\n\nThe Little League World Series is a pair of modified double-elimination tournaments.\n\nThe 10 teams from the United States will compete in the double-elimination tournament with the hopes of advancing to the U.S. championship. The two teams that reach the U.S. final, even the team that is undefeated, play in a one-game championship to advance to the world final.\n\nA loss in the first game sends a team to the loser's bracket, which would require rattling off five consecutive wins in just six days to advance to the U.S. final.\n\nThe 10-team international bracket works the exact same way.\n\nThe U.S. champion and the International champion will meet in the World Series championship to be crowned the best Little League team in the world.\n\nPitch count rules in Little League\n\nPitching changes are frequent in Little League Baseball as managers try to manage their arms during a fast-paced tournament.\n\nPitchers cannot throw more than 85 pitches in one day.\n\nHere are the pitch-count thresholds\n\n1-20 pitches - 0 days rest needed\n\n21-35 pitches - 1 day of rest needed\n\n36-50 pitches - 2 days of rest needed\n\n51-65 pitches - 3 days of rest needed\n\n66 or more pitches - 4 days of rest needed\n\nPlayers who caught four innings are not eligible to pitch that day.\n\nDoes every player bat in Little League?\n\nLittle League uses a continuous batting order. So, if there are 12 players on the team, the lineup will go 1-12 instead of a starting nine.\n\nThere are no inning requirements for playing in the field defensively.\n\nHow far is the pitcher's mound in Little League?\n\nThe mound is 46 feet away from the plate. By comparison, the mound is 60 feet, 6 inches away in Major League Baseball.\n\nWhat are the dimensions of a Little League field?\n\nBases are 60 feet apart from each other. At the Little League World Series, the outfield fences are symmetrical, with left, center and right field being 225 feet from home plate.\n\nBy comparison, Fenway Park's dimensions are 310 feet down the left-field line (don't forget about the 37-foot Green Monster), 420 in center and 302 down the right-field line. Deep left-center clocks in at 379, while deep-right is 380.\n\nAre there video replay challenges in the Little League World Series?\n\nThere are video replay reviews in Little League. Managers are allowed up to two unsuccessful challenges during the first six innings. A manager retains all challenges if his challenge is ruled correct.\n\nIn extra innings, managers are allowed one unsuccessful challenge. If a manager loses both challenges during the first six innings and the game extends into extra, they will be one unsuccessful challenge at their disposal.\n\nHow many innings are Little League games?\n\nLittle League games are six innings.\n\nHow do extra innings work in Little League?\n\nIf a game extends into the seventh inning, teams at the plate will start with a runner in scoring position. The runner is the player who batted last in the previous inning.\n\nCan you bet on the Little League World Series?\n\nGambling is not legal on the Little League World Series.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/baseball/2025/06/09/ncaa-baseball-tournament-winners-losers-college-world-series/84123680007/", "title": "NCAA baseball tournament winners, losers with College World ...", "text": "Updated June 9, 2025, 10:49 p.m. ET\n\nOne thing is certain as the College World Series advances to Omaha, Nebraska: There will be a new national champion in 2025.\n\nDefending winner Tennessee was ejected in super regional play by Arkansas, which swept the Volunteers in their best-of-three series. The Razorbacks join LSU to make the SEC the only league with multiple schools in the eight-team field.\n\nInstead, the World Series features an eclectic makeup of national programs representing six conferences along with one independent, Oregon State. There's even a Cinderella story in Murray State, which beat Duke 5-4 in Monday's elimination game to continues its magical run through the tournament.\n\nFor a few teams, this year’s College World Series marks a long-awaited return to Omaha. That includes the Beavers, who hadn’t reached this point since 2018, and UCLA, which hadn’t advanced to the final eight since winning the 2013 national championship.\n\nWith no obvious favorite heading into the weekend – on paper, the Razorbacks and LSU are probably the teams to beat – this looks to be a wide-open CWS that could end with any one of the teams celebrating on Charles Schwab Field.\n\nThe double-elimination World Series format will conclude with the top two teams playing a best-of-three championship series. The initial matchups will be Arizona against Coastal Carolina, Louisville against Oregon State, UCLA against Murray State and Arkansas against LSU.\n\nCOLLEGE WORLD SERIES Opening matchups for 2025 NCAA baseball championship\n\nBefore moving on to Omaha, let’s look back at the biggest winners and losers from the super regionals:\n\nWinners\n\nMurray State\n\nThe Racers will make the program's College World Series debut after winning two in a row against the Blue Devils, rolling to a 19-9 win on Sunday and then winning 5-4 in Monday's decider. The loss continues Duke's World Series drought, which dates to 1961. Murray State simply wasn't expected to get here: Underdogs in the Oxford regional against Mississippi, the Racers beat the Rebels 12-11 to reach the program's first super regional and then rallied out of another hole to become just the fourth regional No. 4 seed to reach Omaha.\n\nCoastal Carolina\n\nThe Chanticleers will make the second World Series appearance in program history after sweeping Auburn out of the tournament, winning 7-6 in the first game and 4-1 in the second. In the opener, Coastal coughed up a 6-1 lead but went back ahead in the top of the 10th inning on a solo homer from junior catcher Caden Bodine, one of the top backstops in the country. Tied 1-1 in the seventh inning in the second matchup, the Chanticleers got an RBI single from Walker Mitchell to take the lead and then scored another pair on a fielding error and a bases-loaded hit-by-pitch. Keep an eye on these guys: CCU has now won 23 games in a row. The last time Coastal was here it won the whole thing in 2016.\n\nArizona\n\nReaching this point is a surprisingly rare achievement for one of the nation’s more notable programs. Beating North Carolina in Chapel Hill sends Arizona to the College World Series for the 19th time but the programs hasn't won a title since 2012. And this year’s team was not expected to advance this far after scuffling through the end of the regular season, dropping five of six in May against some middling competition, including two of three in a series against Utah, the last-place team in the Big 12. But Arizona is now 8-1 in postseason play after capturing the Big 12 tournament, sweeping through the regional hosted by Oregon and taking two of three against the Tar Heels.\n\nVariety\n\nThere are some heavyweights in the field: LSU won the seventh championship in program history in 2023; Oregon State has won three, most recently in 2018; Coastal won in 2016; UCLA won in 2013; and Arizona has won four times. Arkansas is still seeking its elusive first title after reaching the finals twice, in 1979 and 2018. But none of the teams in Omaha made the World Series last year, bringing a fresh new feel to college baseball’s biggest stage.\n\nLosers\n\nThe ACC\n\nLet’s start with the good news: Louisville outlasted Miami in three games to make the sixth cws in program history. But the ACC had another two teams join Duke in losing in super regional play. North Carolina walloped Arizona 18-2 in the opener of this past weekend’s set in Chapel Hill but then dropped back-to-back games for the first time since March. Florida State also pushed Oregon State to the distance but dropped the opener 5-4 in extra innings and then fell behind 13-3 in the deciding matchup before fighting back to lose 14-10.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nThe second loss to the Wildcats was absolutely brutal. UNC led 3-1 heading into the eighth inning thanks to a three-run homer from senior Jackson Van De Brake only to give the game away with a pair of errors on the infield. The first, on a grounder booted by Van De Brake, cost the Tar Heels a possible double play. UNC then swapped out starter Ryan Lynch for freshman Walker McDuffie only to commit a throwing error on Arizona’s bunt attempt to move runners over, allowing a run to score. Another pitching change to Aidan Haugh, working on back-to-back days for the first time this year, resulted in a two-run single that gave Arizona the lead and eventually the College World Series berth.\n\nThe biggest stories, every morning.

They were dominant this past weekend, winning three straight games in the regional round.\n\nMSU and TCU haven't played since April 1990. Here's a look at this year's matchup.\n\nStarting pitching\n\nTCU's No. 1 starter is Jared Janczak. The sophomore right-hander is 9-0 with a 1.89 ERA.\n\nJanczak struck out 14 batters in a win over Kansas earlier this season.\n\nSenior starter Brian Howard (10-3 with a 4.17 ERA) is the only pitcher in TCU history with multiple 10-win seasons.\n\nDoug Still has been Missouri State's most reliable starter this season. He is 8-2 with a 2.66 ERA.\n\nJordan Knutson and Dylan Coleman were also solid for Missouri State in the regional round.\n\nBullpen\n\nThe back end of Missouri State's bullpen is one of the best in the country.\n\nMissouri Valley Conference Pitcher of the Year Jordan Fromson is 8-3 with a 1.98 ERA in 36 relief appearances. He can come in at any time for coach Keith Guttin's squad.\n\nThe ninth inning has belonged to senior closer Bryan Young who has 8 saves and a 1.53 ERA this season.\n\nHard-throwing TCU closer Durbin Feltman has 16 saves, but he has also blown a pair of save opportunities this season.\n\nHitting\n\nCatcher Evan Skoug is TCU's most accomplished hitter.\n\nThe Big 12's co-Player of the Year, Skoug has 18 home runs and 62 RBIs this season.\n\nLeadoff hitter Austen Wade leads TCU with 78 hits and a .355 batting average.\n\nFor Missouri State, third baseman Jake Burger and short stop Jeremy Eierman form one of the country's best duos.\n\nBurger, the Valley Player of the Year and presumptive first-round pick, has 22 home runs and 65 RBIs.\n\nEierman has 22 home runs and 67 RBIs. He was MSU's best player in the regional. He hit 3 home runs during the tournament, including a walk-off dinger to beat Oklahoma State.\n\nDefense\n\nMissouri State's defense was excellent during the regional tournament in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Bears had only one error in their four games.\n\nBurger earned a Gold Glove for his play at third base last season, and Hunter Steinmetz can cover a lot of ground in center field.\n\nSteinmetz got some national attention for a leaping catch he made Monday night in MSU's win over Arkansas.\n\nThe Horned Frogs had more errors this season (62) than all but one team in the Big 12.\n\nCoaching\n\nMissouri State’s Keith Guttin is the Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year.

The Milwaukee Braves trained in Manatee County and called what’s now LECOM Park in Bradenton its Spring Training home when it won the 1957 World Series title. While still the Boston Braves, the team moved its Spring Training home to Bradenton in 1950 and remained there until the spring of 1962.\n\nLECOM, built in 1923. was known as McKechnie Field when author William Zinsser used it as the setting for his book “Spring Training.”\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates – winners of the 1971 and 1979 World Series crowns – were the two teams to call Sarasota or Manatee their Spring Training home.\n\nPrior to the Pirates and Braves, Bradenton also served as the Spring Training home for St. Louis Cardinals teams that won the World Series in 1931 and 1934.\n\nThe speed at which the home team delivered a World Series title after moving its spring home to Sarasota County has not been lost on North Port city officials, who are working with the Braves to coordinate a welcome celebration once players return.\n\n“For the city of North Port, first of all we’re all very excited and proud for the Atlanta Braves organization,” said North Port City Manager Jerome Fletcher.\n\n“To see them win it all was a phenomenal event,” Fletcher said. “We are over the world proud of them.\n\n“Our partnership with them is something that we treasure and value.\n\n“I would like for us to show that we support them by engaging their players with our community. That’s where the win-win happens.”\n\nIn addition to a celebration at CoolToday Park, Dunn added, “I'm sure there will be some nice surprises throughout the Spring Training season that we’ll be able to provide to the public.”\n\nAnticipating a full Spring\n\nTechnically in their third season at CoolToday Park, the Braves have yet to actually host a full Spring Training schedule in North Port.\n\n“For parts of three years we’ve never fully executed the building, so we are anxious to do that,\" said Dunn, who called the World Series crown “icing on the cake.”\n\nIn 2019, the stadium hosted a Braves spring game, as the stadium construction was just wrapping up. Then the 2020 season was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing concerns limited capacity for Spring Training 2021.\n\n“Last year we operated on limited capacity so we’re prepared to open it up to Braves Country,” Dunn said.\n\nSingle-season tickets for the 2022 Spring Training schedule go on sale Saturday, Nov. 20.\n\nA total of 32 games are scheduled, including split squad games, with 16 games at CoolToday, starting with the Feb. 26 season opener, with the Braves hosting the Boston Red Sox. That full schedule is predicated on Major League owners and players reaching a new labor agreement over the winter and avoiding a stalemate that drags into the preseason.\n\nThe prospect of a full slate of games is generating considerable buzz around the region.\n\n“Our ticket demand is incredibly high,” said Dunn, who noted that the Braves season ticket base and group sales businesses have been strong.\n\nStill, he added, there should be “a couple thousand seats” available for single-game sales. The park has 6,200 fixed seats and an overall capacity of about 8,000, including spaces on a grass berm.\n\n“There’s only so many seats and the one thing we won’t do is jam pack standing room tickets to make it uncomfortable,” Dunn said. “We’re anxious to let everyone see all the unique vantage points CoolToday provides.”\n\nVirginia Haley, president of Visit Sarasota County said she has seen considerable demand from people eager to explore those vantage points too.\n\n“I was at a trade show with meeting planner last week in Las Vegas and every single one – especial in the Southeastern United States – said we’re interested in Sarasota, home of the Braves,” Haley said. “I think it's going to be one of those things that’s not only going to be an amazing Spring Training but this has long legs in terms of connecting that amazing Braves national market to North Port and Sarasota County.”\n\nBill Gunnin, executive director of the North Port Area Chamber of Commerce, agreed.\n\n“The biggest thing about it is, the Braves were the team of the South way back when I grew up – I’ve lived here all my life,” Gunnin said.\n\nKathy Lehner, president and CEO of the Venice Area Chamber of Commerce, said the lure of the Braves World Series victory will definitely be a draw.\n\n“Well, who doesn’t want to be connected to a winner,” Lehner said, then added that more people will visit and perhaps more businesses will relocate to the area.\n\n“Or what’s very popular now is to work remotely,” she added. “Why not work remote from paradise?”\n\nEver since the Braves finalized their plan to move to North Port in 2017, Visit Sarasota has been putting extra emphasis on the Atlanta region but stressed that she envisions more visitors from the entire Southeast.\n\n“I don’t think people understand what a national team the Braves are – or at least throughout the South.”\n\nHaley said the closest thing Sarasota County has seen recently was when the Baltimore Orioles, who moved their Spring Training site to Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota in 2010, were managed by Buck Showalter – specifically the period between 2012 and 2016, when he had the team in the playoffs three times, including an American League East crown in 2014.\n\n“Yes, it’s Atlanta, yes it’s Georgia, but it is the entire South,” Haley said. “I think it’s going to be probably one of the biggest Spring Trainings we’ve ever seen and it’s going to be something that has an impact all year round.\n\n“The thing about CoolToday park that is so awesome – I have friends come into town; we go down here for lunch,” Haley said. “The atmosphere of being in that ballpark – the big screen is always on; the food is so darn good and it’s something that’s there year-round for fans to enjoy.\n\n“Even if you’re here in June, July, you can be part of that Braves success,” she added. “That’s the unique nature of CoolToday Park and all the amazing different events they’ve got there.”\n\nDunn points out that in June, July and August it’s possible to stop in at the Tomahawk Tiki Bar, grab a beverage and a hot dog, sit down watch the Florida Complex League team play baseball during lunch.\n\n“And it’s quality baseball too,” he added.\n\n'Please don't go out there with any Mets stuff at a Braves game': Hospice helps 96-year-old get his wish, a day at the ball park\n\nThe FCL team plays on the main field two to three days a week, with the schedule for that, as well as all of the year-round events, posted on the CoolToday Park Facebook page.\n\nThe Braves themselves still need to hire about 300 people in anticipation of Spring Training, with a job fair slated for Dec. 10. Jobs ranging from ushers and security to bat boys are among those available.\n\nBuzz from the beginning\n\nJust the announcement that the Braves were relocating their Spring Training home to the section of North Port now known as Wellen Park created a buzz in the business world, especially among those who seek out new places to locate corporate headquarters.\n\nRon Starner, executive vice president of Conway, Inc., parent company of Site Selector Magazine, called the move a game-changer and has become a frequent speaker at the city-sponsored annual real estate summit, and participated in the initial 2019 Sarasota County visit of site selectors and media influencers, which included attending the stadium-opening game against the neighboring Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nOne of the fastest-growing cities:Fifth annual North Port Real Estate Summit hints at commercial growth\n\nGunnin said the World Series win is yet another opportunity for North Port to spotlight itself.\n\n“The ripple effect allows North Port to shine and showcase what we have to offer,” Gunnin said. “That’s why we’re so excited about it.”\n\nCoincidentally, the chamber's annual business and community expo, scheduled for March 12 at the George Mullen Activity Center, carries the theme: “We are the Champions.”\n\nGunnin said the theme also pays homage to the 2021 Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Tampa Bay Rays, who reached the World Series for the second time in franchise history in 2020, but admitted it wasn’t set in stone until after the Braves’ win.\n\nDunn said the Braves are well aware of the role the franchise plays in the local economy.\n\nWellen Park was already one of the fastest-growing master-planned communities in the country prior to the opening of CoolToday Park.\n\nThe new stadium has only amplified that.\n\n“We are ecstatic for the entire Atlanta Braves organization and given that 2022 will be their first stabilized Spring Training season in this amazing ball park,” Wellen Park marketing vice president Christine Masney said via email. “Their win gives our current and future residents another compelling experience to interact with the World Series Champions.\"\n\nDunn called the team's partnership with the developer phenomenal.\n\n“They are experiencing rapid growth at a tremendous pace,\" Dunn said.\n\n“We’re able to showcase the area,” he added. “With all Spring Training, there’s certainly television visibility and marketing directly to the markets of the teams,’ Dunn said. “But I think when the World Series champ resides in the county, it brings a little bit more.”\n\nIn search of a downtown: Downtown Wellen to reshape south Sarasota County with commercial development\n\nFletcher noted that the ongoing development in Wellen Park, which includes an effort by Mattamy Homes and its partners to create “Downtown Wellen,” a town center around an 80-acre man-made lake, is proof that the city is showcasing a role where it can be “somewhere that is known to support and grow and develop and make people happy. That’s what we’re doing.”\n\nHe also envisions signs and banners trumpeting the Braves success.\n\n“The economic development that is happening in North Port, however we got on the map, must be attributed to CoolToday Park and we can’t deny that,” Fletcher said. “This is about the Braves and what they have done and those players.\n\n“We just want them to know that they are welcomed, they are loved and we support them in any way we can.”\n\nDunn said it’s an exciting time, complete with an “unbelievable” national media spotlight. But he stressed that the team’s goal is to not to rest on its laurels.\n\n“It all starts here,” Dunn said. “The beauty of the Atlanta Braves is it's a young team; it’s built to win and we didn't intend to win the World Series and (just) be one.\n\n“We intend to be contenders for the World Series every year.”\n\nAs he stood on the field, with a nod to his surroundings, Dunn said: “It’s a baseball factory.\n\n“We have kids back there right now, doing strength and conditioning camps, it’s a year-round process.”\n\nEarle Kimel primarily covers south Sarasota County for the Herald-Tribune and can be reached at earle.kimel@heraldtribune.com.

For the latest updates on victim recovery efforts, please read USA TODAY's live coverage of the plane crash investigation on Friday, Jan. 31.\n\nWASHINGTON - The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed to USA TODAY on Thursday evening that investigators recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the Bombardier CRJ700 airplane that collided in midair with an Army helicopter, leaving 67 people dead near Ronald Reagan National Airport.\n\nThe agency said the recorders, a key component of determining the final moments and circumstances of air disasters, are at NTSB labs “for evaluation.”\n\nNTSB spokesperson Peter Knudson said there are no additional recorders on the airplane, and investigators are searching for one recorder from the helicopter.\n\nFederal aviation investigators vowed earlier in the day that they will find the cause of a horrific collision.\n\nNTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said at a briefing that the agency wants to assure the American public it will \"leave no stone unturned in this investigation . . . This is a whole-of-government effort.\"\n\nTodd Inman of the NTSB said it is too soon to know whether human error or other factors were at play in Wednesday night's collision, which left no survivors, but he said the agency expects to have a preliminary report within 30 days.\n\n\"A loss of life in an aviation accident is very unusual in the United States, and our heartfelt sorrow goes out to everyone who's affected,\" Inman said. \"It affects us, it affects everyone around us. There are a lot of people hurting today. We will help find out what happened, we will do it factually and we will do it accurately.''\n\nThe U.S. had not had a major commercial plane crash since 2009, when a Colgan Air wreck outside Buffalo, New York, killed 50 people, including one on the ground. The nation's deadliest previous aviation catastrophe claimed 260 lives in 2001, when an American Airlines flight went down in Queens, New York, almost exactly two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe crash occurred just before 9 p.m. Wednesday when American Airlines Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas, attempted to land and collided in midair with the Black Hawk helicopter. The passenger plane, with 64 people aboard, and the helicopter, carrying three soldiers, plunged into the icy Potomac River and triggered a massive recovery effort.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, John Donnelly, the chief of Washington’s fire department, said 28 bodies were pulled from the water. He added that authorities were transitioning from a rescue mission to a recovery operation.\n\nOfficials have described both the airplane and helicopter crews as \"experienced\" and noted that the helicopter and the plane were following standard flight patterns.\n\n\"Everything was standard in the lead-up to the crash,\" Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said. \"Now, obviously something happened here, but you'll get more information and more details as this investigation moves forward. We'll learn what happened.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Reagan National Airport, located in Arlington, Virginia, resumed flights at 11 a.m. Thursday, officials said. As of 10:30 a.m., more than 500 flights to and from the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware.\n\n∎ Among those who died in the collision are Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who won the 1994 world championships for Russia in pairs figure skating before moving to the U.S. and becoming coaches. In addition, four other members of the Skating Club of Boston, including two teenagers and their parents, were on board the flight from Wichita.\n\n∎ A Philippine National Police official was also aboard the doomed passenger plane, the agency announced Friday. A spokesperson said in a news briefing that Col. Pergentino Malabed, who served as the chief of the supply management division, was killed in the midair collision.\n\n∎ Two Chinese citizens are among the victims of the crash, Xinhua, China’s state news agency, reported. The Chinese embassy told Xinhua it has requested the U.S. to verify the information, formally inform Chinese officials and provide assistance to the victims’ families. USA TODAY has reached out to the Chinese embassy for comment.\n\nPilots of doomed flight identified\n\nThe pilots of the plane have been identified by sources close to them as captain Jonathan Campos and first officer Samuel Lilley, although the Washington medical examiner has yet to confirm the information.\n\nEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, said Campos, 34, was a 2015 graduate from the institution, which is \"deeply saddened to learn of'' his death. \"Our thoughts are with his family and the families and loved ones of all impacted by this tragic accident,'' school vice president for communications Sarah Barczyk added in a statement.\n\nLilley, 28, was also working on the flight, according to a Facebook post made by his father, Tim Lilley. The post also said the younger Lilley was engaged to be married in the fall.\n\n“I was so proud when Sam became a pilot,” the post read. “Now it hurts so bad I can’t even cry myself to sleep.”\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Lilley’s father, Tim, who said he wasn't immediately available to speak about his son. But he told the Daily Mail that his son was near becoming a captain.\n\nSam Lilley graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in business administration. School President Kyle Marrero told USA TODAY Lilley \"embodied the Eagle spirit and soared beyond in his career.”\n\n− Chris Quintana\n\nWhat the day's news means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nCrew member aboard helicopter identified\n\nMississippi Governor Tate Reeves confirmed the identify Thursday of one of the three crew members of the U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter involved in the collision.\n\nReeves said Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Eaves, a native of Brooksville, Miss., died in the crash.\n\nThe Clarion Ledger, a USA TODAY Network paper in Mississippi, reported that Eaves’ wife shared the news in a Facebook post early Thursday.\n\n“I am sure by now all of you have heard the news of the tragedy that has occurred in DC. My husband was one of the pilots in the Blackhawk,” Carrie Eaves wrote. Later in the day, she posted a photo of her husband in uniform and invited others to share memories of him, and dozens shared photos of him doing community service, running in a marathon or spending time with family and friends.\n\nReports: Another jet had to abort landing day before crash\n\nA day before the horrific midair collision between an American Airlines flight and Army helicopter near the nation’s capital, a passenger airplane had to abort its first landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport after a chopper appeared in its flight path, The Washington Post and CNN reported.\n\nThe Post, citing an audio recording from air traffic control, reported that Republic Airways Flight 4514 had to \"make a second approach after a helicopter appeared near its flight path.\"\n\nThe plane, flying from Connecticut, reached an altitude of about 1,600 feet during its first descent, while the helicopter was at about 300 feet, according to CNN.\n\nThe Post first reported the Tuesday incident.\n\n— Charles Ventura\n\nTrump speculates on cause of the collision\n\nPresident Donald Trump noted the loss of life earlier Thursday. \"Sadly, there are no survivors,\" Trump said at the White House. Trump also said the helicopter crew \"should've seen where they were going.\"\n\nTrump speculated on possible causes of the collision and leveed criticisms at previous Democratic administrations as well as policies of diversity, equity and inclusion while speaking about the crash.\n\nTrump referenced \"a confluence of bad decisions that were made,\" but at different times suggested the Federal Aviation Administration and air traffic controllers could be blamed without providing evidence.\n\nHe later admonished the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and then took aim at FAA hiring practices. \"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website,\" he said.\n\nTrump provided no evidence backing up his claims that Biden- and Obama-era hiring practices and diversity initiatives are to blame for the crash. He did not say when the air traffic controllers involved in the crash were hired, nor did he specify their race or gender.\n\nGroups blast Trump's claims on DEI\n\nThe American Association of People with Disabilities posted a message on social media saying, \"FAA employees with disabilities did not cause last night's tragic plane crash. The investigation into the crash is still ongoing. It is extremely inappropriate for the President to use this tragedy to push an anti-diversity hiring agenda. Doing so makes all Americans less safe.''\n\nLeaders of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus echoed similar concerns in a statement. “As families grieve the loss of their loved ones in last night’s aviation crash, President Trump does not offer any semblance of compassion or leadership,” the group said. “Instead, he is exploiting this tragedy to advance his discriminatory agenda and further divide Americans.”\n\nRep. Yvette Clarke, a New York Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, blasted Trump and his fellow Republicans for seeking to “scapegoat and villainize” Black and minority communities for political gain.\n\n“President Trump, without evidence or regard for the gravity and solemnity of this incident in which American lives were lost, held a press conference to falsely blame the diversity initiatives of past administrations for the cause of this incident,” the caucus wrote in a statement. “Not only are the President’s claims untrue, they also speak to the Republican Party’s desire to divide us as a country.”\n\nAt Thursday's briefing, the NTSB's Homendy also responded to Trump's statements on DEI: \"As part of any investigation, we look at the human, the machine and the environment, so we will look at all the humans that were involved in this accident. Again, we will look at the aircraft, we will look at the helicopter, we will look at the environment in which they were operating in. That is standard in any part of our investigation.''\n\nExperts search for explanations on plane crash\n\nAt the news conference, Homendy asked reporters for patience in finding the cause of the accident, saying, \"We have substantial amounts of information. We need to verify information, we need to take our time to make sure it's accurate.''\n\nOthers are also searching for explanations for the rare mid-air collision that resulted in the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in more than two decades.\n\nOne of the first topics to address will be whether either the plane or helicopter was in the wrong airspace. Early signs from air traffic control audio suggest the American Airlines flight was following the designated path for landing at the airport and that the helicopter was also in an area it was generally authorized to be in, though possibly at a different altitude than the one designated for its flight path.\n\n“Even the best experts right now, who are on the front lines, have a ton of unanswered questions,'' said William J. McGee, senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project. \"They know more than we do right now, but they still don’t know everything.”\n\n− Zach Wichter\n\nTransportation secretary planning changes to FAA\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he met with families of some of the crash victims on Thursday night.\n\n“I can’t take away their pain, but I can do a very small part to help ease it by keeping my promise to get to the bottom of what happened and be 100% transparent about the results of the investigation,” he wrote on X.\n\nDuffy said he will visit the Federal Aviation Administration command center and recovery hangar on Friday, adding he is “developing an initial plan to fix” the FAA and will release details soon.\n\nHegseth says Army helicopter was doing a 'proficiency training flight'\n\nThe Army helicopter that collided with an American Airlines plane Wednesday night was on an “annual proficiency training flight” when it crashed, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in a video statement posted to X on Thursday morning.\n\nThe crew was “fairly experienced,” and was conducting a night evaluation, Hegseth said. Night goggles were on board.\n\n“There was some sort of an elevation issue\" that is being \"investigating at the DOD and Army level,\" Hegseth said without providing details.\n\nA senior-level aviation team deployed Wednesday night will look into whether the helicopter was in the right corridor and altitude when the crash occurred, Hegseth said. The Defense Department has not yet released the names of the service members on the flight and is currently notifying their families.\n\n– Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nVirginia schools mourn loss of students, parents\n\nSchool districts in Virginia on Thursday announced current and former students and parents died in the flight collision. In email updates, Fairfax County Pubic Schools said many on the flight were returning from a figure skating event in Wichita.\n\nThree students and six parents died in the crash, Superintendent Michelle Reid said. Two of the parents were current or former district staff members. The pre-K through-12th grade district, located just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., didn’t release the victims’ names out of respect for them and their families.\n\n“This is a time we must hold one another a bit closer,” Reid said.\n\nLoudon County Public Schools, a school district just outside Washington, also announced former students were among those who died.\n\n“This unimaginable loss has deeply affected our community, and with great sorrow, we have learned that multiple victims were former LCPS students,” Superintendent Aaron Spence said in an update.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\n6 members of Boston skating club, including 2 teens, killed in crash, CEO says\n\nSix members of the Skating Club of Boston, including two teenagers, were aboard the flight that crashed outside Washington, D.C., CEO Doug Zeghibe said at a news conference.\n\n\"This will have long, reaching impacts for our skating community,\" he said.\n\nZeghibe said the six people affiliated with his club were on board the flight after attending a national development camp for junior and novice skaters in Wichita earlier this week. The group included world champion figure skaters Naumov and Shishkova, Zeghibe confirmed.\n\nTeenage figure skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane − as well as their respective mothers, Jin and Christine − were also on the flight, Zeghibe said. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Virginia, identified another figure skating coach, Inna Volyanskaya, as also among the victims.\n\n− John Bacon\n\nSkaters aboard plane: Figure skaters from US, Russia among those aboard doomed plane\n\nTransportation secretary 'will not accept excuses'\n\nDuffy told reporters Thursday that he believes the crash could have been prevented, calling such an event \"unacceptable.''\n\n\"When Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination − that didn’t happen yesterday,'' Duffy said. \"That’s unacceptable and so we will not accept excuses.”\n\nDuffy said there was “not a breakdown” between the plane, the helicopter and the control tower. \"Something went wrong here,\" he said. \"I look forward to the time and point when we can give you that information.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAs officials turn to a recovery stage, they are working to recover all the bodies in the water and begin removing and analyzing the crashed plane and helicopter.\n\nDuffy said the fuselage of the American Airlines plane was inverted and located in three different areas of the river.\n\nHe added that the National Transportation Safety Board, in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration, will analyze the aircraft \"to get the best results possible for the American people.”\n\nPilots were 'experienced,' American Airlines CEO says\n\nRobert Isom, the CEO of American Airlines, said the pilots aboard the passenger jet from Kansas were \"experienced.\"\n\nHe said the captain has flown for at least six years with PSA, a regional airline owned by the American Airlines Group. The first officer had \"almost two years\" with the airline, Isom said. They were among four crewmembers on board the plane.\n\nIsom told reporters the passenger jet was on an \"otherwise normal approach\" when it collided with the Black Hawk helicopter.\n\n\"We don't know why the military aircraft came into the path of the PSA aircraft,\" he said.\n\nWichita holds a community prayer vigil over 'terrible tragedy'\n\nWichita Mayor Lily Wu called Wednesday's crash a \"terrible tragedy\" and said it \"will unite those in Washington, D.C., and Kansas, Wichita, forever.\"\n\n\"Tragedies like this remind us that we are one community; whether a Wichitan, a Kansan or an American – we are one community and in times of struggle, we do come together in grief and sadness to lift one another,\" Wu said at an emotional news conference Thursday. \"Wichita is stronger because we are together.\"\n\nAt a public prayer vigil at city hall Thursday afternoon, Rabbi Shmulik Greenberg told reporters it is important to come together in moments like these to show unity as a community, regardless of faith denomination.\n\n“When things like this happen, it's so important that we come together and shine a light,'' Greenberg said. \"It’s not enough to just grieve together, but this has to continue on to joyous times together.”\n\nWeather will be clear in Washington as recovery efforts continue\n\nFor recovery efforts, the weather in Washington, D.C., should be sunny and seasonably cold on Thursday before rain arrives Friday.\n\n\"Other than the frigid water temperatures, we don't expect any adverse weather Thursday to negatively impact search and rescue efforts,\" Dan DePodwin, AccuWeather senior director of forecast operations, said in an e-mail to USA TODAY.\n\nAt the time of the crash Wednesday night, the weather was clear but breezy in Washington, according to records from the National Weather Service. A weather station at Reagan National Airport at 8:52 p.m. reported an air temperature of 50 degrees, fair skies and a visibility of 10 miles. Winds were steady out of the northwest at 16 mph but were gusting to 26 mph.\n\nMeteorologists say water temperatures ranged from 33-36 degrees in the Potomac River near the crash site. \"At these frigid water temperatures, the human body’s core temperature quickly drops. Exhaustion or unconsciousness can occur in as little as 15 to 30 minutes,\" DePodwin said.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nWho makes the Black Hawk helicopter?\n\nConnecticut-based aircraft manufacturer Sikorsky, which is owned by Lockheed Martin, makes the UH-60 Black Hawk. It was a U.S. Army Black Hawk, with the call sign PAT25, that crashed with the American Airlines plane in midair, according to Aviation Safety Network, which provides information on aircraft accidents.\n\nThe Black Hawk helicopter serves a variety of uses in the military, including air assault, medical evacuation and utility transport.

For the latest updates, please read USA TODAY's coverage of the plane crash investigation on Friday, Feb. 7.\n\nWASHINGTON – The U.S. Army helicopter that collided with an American Airlines plane killing 67 people last week had turned off an advanced surveillance system that has been hailed for making airspace safer, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said on Thursday.\n\nCruz, who was among a group of lawmakers briefed on the collision by federal authorities, said the Black Hawk helicopter had switched off its automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast sometime before the Jan. 29 crash.\n\n\"This was a training mission, so there was no compelling national security reason for ADS-B to be turned off,\" Cruz said after a briefing from the National Transportation Safety Board and FAA. He added that the helicopter had a transponder so it would appear on radar, but said ADS-B is significantly more accurate.\n\nThe system, which is the preferred method of surveillance for air traffic control in the U.S., improves visibility by broadcasting an aircraft's GPS location, altitude, and ground speed, according to the FAA. The system includes a display showing pilots where other aircraft are in the sky or on a runway.\n\nThe helicopter was on a routine training mission when it collided with the airliner, which was inbound from Wichita, Kansas. Data indicated that the Black Hawk may have been flying above its 200-foot flight ceiling, though the NTSB said investigators need to access the crashed aircraft to verify the data.\n\nSalvage crews recover major components of the helicopter\n\nCrews finished recovering \"all major components\" of the Army helicopter and passenger jet out of the Potomac River on Thursday, Unified Command said, concluding a dayslong salvage operation about one week after the horrific midair collision.\n\nThe NTSB said in an update Thursday evening that it is still searching for some parts of the helicopter, including the right engine and tail rotor. Officials said the wreckage is expected to be offloaded from a barge on Friday and transferred to a secure location.\n\nRecovery of the helicopter is a crucial component in the federal probe as authorities seek to confirm data related to its altitude at the time of the collision, according to the NTSB.\n\nIn the next phase of the operation, officials said crews will shift their focus to clearing smaller debris before demobilizing equipment by Feb. 16.\n\nTo assist with the operation, Unified Command said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will fly over the Potomac at a low altitude and project a green laser onto the water’s surface to scan for debris. The flight will take place around 2 a.m. Friday.\n\nStudents, Olympic skaters, families: A tribute to lives lost in the DC plane crash\n\nReagan National Airport limits flights after crash\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that it would slow the arrivals rate at Ronald Reagan National Airport outside of Washington as weather and recovery efforts affected flight paths into the airport.\n\n\"The FAA is slowing traffic into and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to weather conditions and recovery efforts in the area,\" the FAA said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nThe move was first reported by Reuters, which said that arrivals would be reduced from 28 per hour to 26 per hour during the slowdown. The reduced arrivals rate would likely lead to a slight increase in average delay lengths at the airport while it was in force.\n\n– Zach Wichter, USA TODAY\n\nSenator criticizes Elon Musk’s involvement with FAA\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell penned a letter Thursday to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urging him to remove \"all conflicts of interest\" between the FAA and tech billionaire Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla.\n\nThe Washington state Democrat cited previous feuds between SpaceX and the FAA over regulations and fines. In response to proposed civil penalties over alleged launch violations last year, Musk had said he planned to sue the agency for \"regulatory overreach.\"\n\n\"It is a conflict of interest for someone whose company is regulated by the federal government to be involved in anything that affects his personal financial interest, his company, or his competitors,\" wrote Cantwell, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\nThe letter comes after Duffy announced on X that the Department of Government Efficiency – which President Donald Trump has appointed Musk to lead – was going to \"plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.\"\n\nOfficials will address staffing, congested air traffic after deadly collision\n\nThe newly appointed transportation secretary said he would change the rules that govern staffing at airport control towers and vowed to examine the congested airspace in the Washington area following the fatal crash at Reagan National Airport.\n\nSpeaking about rules that allowed a supervisor to reduce staffing before the fatal crash, Duffy said \"We're going to pull that authority back to make sure that we have the right policies in place inside our towers to make sure when you fly you're safe.\"\n\nDuffy said he also planned to announce steps to increase air traffic control training while hiring more applicants. The FAA is about 3,000 controllers short of staffing levels and nearly all control towers have staffing issues.\n\nMoreover, Duffy said officials would look at military missions in Washington airspace and see whether they could be scheduled at times when traffic is lower. The Black Hawk helicopter was on a routine training mission when it collided with the airliner.\n\n\"We also have to look at (military) missions that have flown the DC airspace,\" Duffy said on Wednesday. \"We're going to hopefully find this out, but if they had night vision goggles on a mission like that at nine o'clock at night and not at 1 a.m. – it is unacceptable.\"\n\n\"We can fly training missions at a different time of night,\" he added.\n\nOn Thursday, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy confirmed to reporters that it appeared the helicopter pilot was wearing night vision goggles based on the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nWhat we know about the NTSB's investigation into the collision\n\nSo far, investigators with the NTSB have interviewed all five people working in the control tower at the time of the collision, collected data from the black boxes recovered from the aircraft, obtained maintenance and flight logs, and have begun piecing together a timeline of the events leading up the crash, synchronizing flight data and communications.\n\nAfter recovering the wreckage of the crashed plane, investigators will examine its cockpit switch positions and instrument readings, according to the NTSB. The agency said it still needs to examine the Black Hawk to verify more information about the accident, especially the helicopter's altitude at the time of the crash.\n\nThe air traffic control tower display showed the Black Hawk was flying at 300 feet at the time of the collision, the NTSB has said, though that flight track data was rounded to the nearest 100 feet and the exact altitude is still not known.\n\nAccording to the latest release, it appears the helicopter exceeded the 200-foot maximum altitude assigned to the flight path it used on the night of the crash. To confirm that, investigators need to access the helicopter.\n\nThe NTSB said it expects to have a preliminary report outlining the facts and information gathered during the initial phase of the probe within 30 days of the crash. A final report detailing the cause of the crash is expected to take one to two years to complete.\n\nRate of near-midair collisions are higher around DCA\n\nAfter last week's midair collision, the FAA announced Thursday that it is \"reviewing other airports with high volumes of mixed helicopter and airplane traffic nearby.\"\n\nThere have been 30 near-midair collisions since 1987 around Reagan National Airport, with one-third of those incidents being military aircraft-related and seven including helicopters. While this is higher than the national rate and could cause concern among air travelers, aviation experts say the numbers don't indicate flying is unsafe.\n\n\"It’s important to keep a little bit perspective, for a lot of folks 30 aircraft sound like a lot but it’s almost over 40 years,\" said Philip Mann, an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida.\n\nNMACs, formerly called near-misses, are defined by the FAA as \"an incident associated with the operation of an aircraft in which a possibility of collision occurs as a result of proximity of less than 500 feet to another aircraft,\" or when a pilot, crew member or even passenger reports \"a collision hazard\" between two or more aircraft.\n\nMann said this could cause \"a little bit of fuzziness.\"\n\n\"There could still be a football-field-and-a-half distance between the two (aircraft) and they could be side-by-side,\" he said. \"If you come a foot inside of that, you've had a near miss.\"\n\n– Kathleen Wong\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/01/30/dc-plane-crash-victims-cedarville-university-student-grace-maxwell/78062427007/", "title": "Three with Ohio connections among 67 killed in D.C. crash of ...", "text": "Jan. 30, 2025 Updated Jan. 31, 2025, 12:40 p.m. ET\n\nAt least three people with Ohio connections have been identified as being among the total 67 people authorities say were killed in a mid-air collision between an American Eagle regional passenger jet and an Army Blackhawk helicopter Wednesday night in Washington, D.C.\n\nGrace Maxwell, 20, a student at Cedarville University in Greene County, was on board the American Eagle flight from her hometown of Wichita, Kansas, that collided with an Army helicopter at about 8:55 p.m. Wednesday while the jet was on approach to a runway at Ronald Reagan National Airport.\n\nShe was among 60 passengers and 4 crew members aboard the American Eagle flight, operated by PSA for American Airlines.\n\nAuthorities said all aboard the flight died after the fiery collision with the helicopter broke the aircraft apart and sent it plunging in three sections into the icy Potomac River below.

The lawsuit blamed the government, American Airlines, and its regional partner, PSA Airlines, for their roles in the Jan. 29 midair collision.\n\nIn a 209-page court filing, the government said it is among the defendants liable for the damages from the crash. The filing states that the U.S. Army flight crew failed to adequately operate the helicopter at a safe distance and that Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers did not properly follow FAA procedures.\n\nAccording to the filing, reviewed by USA TODAY, the Army pilots \"failure to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid\" the commercial airliner makes the government liable for damages in the wrongful death lawsuit.\n\nDC plane crash: Mapping the flight paths that put jet and helicopter on collision course\n\nAmerican Airlines Flight 5342 was about to land at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on the evening of Jan. 29 when it collided with an Army Black Hawk Helicopter, which had been conducting a routine training mission.\n\nBoth aircraft plummeted into the Potomac River below, killing 64 people on board the plane and three people on the helicopter. The crash victims included members of the U.S. figure skating community and their families who were returning from a competition in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nThe collision was the first fatal crash of a commercial plane in the U.S. since 2009, and raised concerns over the country's aging air traffic control system and aviation safety.\n\nWhat does the wrongful death lawsuit claim?\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Sept. 24, claimed that the airlines involved in the crash should have known the risks of flying into the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The airport had previously been considered one of the most dangerous in the country due to the high volume of military air traffic in the area.\n\n\"The defendants were required to exercise vigilance when operating and/or controlling aircraft in the vicinity of Reagan National Airport. These defendants, however, utterly failed in their responsibilities to the traveling public,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nStudents, Olympic skaters, and more: A tribute to lives lost in the DC plane crash\n\nThe complaint further alleges that the airlines \"manipulated and abused\" the arrival rate system at the airport \"to force in more of their arrivals per hour at the airport despite its knowledge that doing so severely limited the margins for safety.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also claimed that the Army flight crew failed to operate the helicopter at or below the mandatory altitude, and that the FAA’s air traffic controllers failed to separate aircraft in the airspace and issue safety alerts when aircraft were in an unsafe proximity.\n\nAt the time of the incident, the Army helicopter was flying above maximum altitude levels and not broadcasting an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast system, also known as ADS-B.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigating collision\n\nA preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board suggested that thousands of close calls involving helicopters and commercial airplanes occurred in the same area near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport from 2021 to 2024.\n\nThe NTSB's investigation into the crash remains ongoing.

A preliminary report on the incident is expected within 30 days of the collision, officials said.\n\nFederal mortuary, mental health teams deployed after plane-helicopter crash\n\nIn the wake of the collision near Reagan National Airport, a team of federal forensic specialists and medical examiners has been deployed to help local officials as they pull bodies out the Potomac River and work to identify the remains.\n\nAt the request of the NTSB, the Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT) has begun offering services to the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, including the collection of medical records, DNA samples and fingerprints.\n\nDMORT provides medical examiners, pathologists, forensic odontologists, dental assistants, funeral directors and other experts for “technical assistance and personnel to recover and identify the remains of disaster victims,\" the Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response said in a statement.\n\nImmediately after the accident the administration deployed tactical medical providers to support emergency responders, along with experts from ASPR’s Disaster Behavioral Health Team. \"The team conducted a rapid behavioral health needs assessment which (DC) officials will use to put resources in place to support the family member’s behavioral health needs,\" ASPR said.\n\nThe agency “is honored to provide the additional hands and expertise that local, state, and federal authorities request during a tragedy like this,” said John Knox, the principal deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response.\n\nMourning in the 'air capital' of the world\n\nThe devastating plane and helicopter collision has drawn Wichita − known globally as the \"air capital of the world\" − and its aviation roots into the national spotlight.\n\nFor residents of Wichita, where American Eagle flight 5342 departed from, the ramifications of the crash run deep. Many of the city's half million residents are employed by the aviation industry, and those who aren't still feel connected through Wichita's key role in the history of aviation.\n\nDuring the '20s, the city’s 16 manufacturers built more than 120 planes on a weekly basis, according to the city’s visitor’s bureau. Currently, Textron Aviation, which manufactures Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft, is headquartered in Wichita, as is Spirit AeroSystems – the manufacturing arm of Boeing. Spirit AeroSystems and Textron Aviation are two of the city’s largest employers.\n\n\"This is a terrible tragedy that will unite those in Washington, D.C., and Wichita, Kansas, forever,\" Wichita Mayor Lily Wu said during an emotional news conference.\n\n− Alice Mannette\n\nPhilippine National Police official among victims in collision\n\nA Philippine National Police official was aboard the doomed passenger plane, the agency announced Friday.\n\nA spokesperson said in a news briefing that Col. Pergentino Malabed, who served as the chief of the supply management division, was killed in the midair collision.\n\nMalabed was “on official travel at the time of the incident, fulfilling his duty as a dedicated police officer − committed to the service of protecting and securing both the PNP and the nation,” the agency said in a statement.\n\n“His untimely passing is a profound loss to the PNP, where he served with honor, integrity, and dedication throughout his career,” the Philippine National Police said. “We extend our deepest condolences to his bereaved family, loved ones, and colleagues. The PNP is committed to providing them with all necessary support during this difficult time.”\n\nDonald Trump's comments on deadly plane-helicopter crash\n\nSpeaking from the White House, Trump on Thursday speculated on the cause of the crash, questioning the position of the helicopter and blaming the tragedy on his two Democratic predecessors and their emphasis on diversity in hiring, which he claimed had lowered standards for air traffic controllers.\n\n\"The FAA is actively recruiting workers who suffer severe intellectual disabilities, psychiatric problems and other mental and physical conditions under a diversity and inclusion hiring initiative spelled out on the agency’s website,\" he said without proving evidence backing up his claims that Biden- and Obama-era hiring practices and diversity initiatives are to blame for the crash or that race/ethnicity, gender or ability was related or responsible.\n\nThe president also said the helicopter crew \"should have seen where they were going\" and asked, \"What was the helicopter doing in that track?\"\n\n\"You had a pilot problem from the standpoint of the helicopter because it was, it was a very clear night,\" Trump said. An official cause of the crash has not been identified.\n\n− Michael Collins, Bart Jansen, Joey Garrison and Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nAir traffic control staffing under scrutiny\n\nThe staffing at Reagan National Airport at the time of the collision is drawing intense scrutiny after multiple news outlets reported a single air traffic controller was responsible for directing helicopters and commercial airliners. The New York Times and NBC News reported that an FAA report that said those tasks are typically split between two staffers.\n\nReagan National Airport is home to the busiest runway in the country. And in recent years, shortages of air traffic controllers, near collisions and the addition of more direct flights at the airport has fueled safety concerns.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, the FAA referred questions to the NTSB, which is leading the investigation. \"We cannot comment on any aspect of open investigations,\" the FAA said in an email. \"The FAA will quickly take any actions necessary based on evidence from the investigation.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/08/dc-plane-crash-updates-investigators-river-wreckage/78359440007/", "title": "DC plane crash updates: Investigators scan bottom of river", "text": "Feb. 8, 2025, 2:03 p.m. ET\n\nTen days after a passenger jet and a Black Hawk helicopter collided over the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., killing all 67 people on board, investigators have recovered most of the debris from the wreckage and worked Saturday to find what might remain on the river floor.\n\nThe crash on Jan. 29 involved a military-operated helicopter on a routine training mission and an American Airlines plane about to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport from Wichita, Kansas. The collision sent both aircraft into the frigid waters below.\n\nEarly morning Saturday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was tasked with performing a scan of the bottom of the Potomac to identify any objects that might remain from the crash, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nThe collision is the most deadly among several recent deadly aviation disasters across the country. Days later, the fatal crash of a Medevac jet in Philadelphia killed seven people and injured more than 20 others. On Thursday, a small airplane carrying 10 people in Alaska went missing and was found crashed amid sea ice on Friday with all presumed dead.\n\nHere's what to know about the investigation into the deadliest aviation disaster in over two decades:\n\nWhere the investigation stands\n\nA preliminary report on the crash from the National Transportation Safety Board is expected in late February. NTSB officials have said little about the cause of the crash as the investigation continues.\n\nNTSB investigators have interviewed all five people working in the control tower at the time of the collision, collected data from the black boxes recovered from the aircraft, obtained maintenance and flight logs, and have begun piecing together a timeline of the events leading up the crash, synchronizing flight data and communications.\n\nThe wreckage from both aircraft will be placed in a hangar at DCA to be inspected by investigators, the NTSB said. They will examine cockpit switch positions and instrument readings. The NTSB said further inspection of the helicopter would help determine details under intense national scrutiny like the altitude it was flying at.\n\nInvestigators scan bottom of river Saturday\n\nTo help divers identify additional items for removal from the Potomac, NOAA was set to fly a low-altitude TopoBathy lidar flight overnight, officials said. The technology uses a green laser to scan the river floor and help investigators map out its layout.\n\nThe scan was scheduled from 2 to 5 a.m. Saturday, the NTSB said. Passersby would be able to see the green laser, which is safe to look at, but local police said direct eye contact should be avoided.\n\nCrews finished retrieving all the \"major components\" of both the helicopter and the plane out of the Potomac River earlier this week, officials said, but some parts were still unaccounted for. That included the right engine and tail rotor, the NTSB said on Thursday.\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann, Chris Kenning and Minnah Arshad, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/08"}]}

Judge Steven Hippler opted on July 2 to accept the agreement, which has divided the victims’ families.\n\nThe guilty plea ensures Kohberger will avoid an upcoming trial and the possibility of capital punishment for the murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.\n\nAll were found stabbed to death in the rental house near the University of Idaho campus on Nov. 13, 2022. The murders shocked the campus community and horrified the residents of Moscow, a quiet college town in northern Idaho that hadn't reported a murder in five years.\n\nWeeks after the killings, Kohberger was arrested in Pennsylvania, where his family lives. At the time of the murders, he was a doctoral student studying criminal justice at Washington State University, less than 10 miles from Moscow.\n\nAt the hearing July 2, Kohberger sat still and appeared unemotional when the court read the names of the four students. Asked if he had committed the murders willfully and with premeditation, he replied with a flat \"yes.\"\n\nHippler set a sentencing hearing for July 23 and said it may continue into a second day to give the victims' families ample time to make statements before a sentence is officially handed down.\n\nVictim’s family slams deal\n\nThe families of the four victims have been split in their reactions to the plea agreement.\n\nSome slammed the deal as an easy resolution for the courts that provides no closure to the families at the heart of the case.\n\n\"This plea did not represent the victims’ families, it represented an easy way out and no answers,\" the Goncalves family said in a statement that called the wait for a resolution a \"torture chamber.\"\n\n\"Everyone loves the justice system until you get involved in it,\" the family said in the statement provided by their attorney. \"Then you really see that most of the time the cases and resolutions have nothing to do with the victims. At least that was our experience.\"\n\nThe statement said that the family had hoped for answers about many details, including Kohberger's motive for killing, which has never been revealed.\n\n\"Today was the day, the day for answers, the day to find out what happened, to find out really anything about what the Defendant did that night and why he took the lives of 4 beautiful people,\" the family said. \"At least that’s what we hoped for but hope is really all we had today.\"\n\nOthers celebrated the potential end to the ordeal.\n\nOutside the courthouse, Leander James, an attorney for the parents of Madison Mogen, said \"We support the plea agreement 100%.\"\n\n\"We now embark on a new path,\" he told reporters. \"We embark on a path of hope and healing.”\n\nThe family of Ethan Chapin supports the deal, their spokesperson, Christina Teves, told the Associated Press.\n\nKohberger's plea comes weeks before murder trial\n\nKohberger's trial was expected to begin with jury selection on Aug. 4 and opening statements on Aug. 18.\n\nProsecutors were set to present DNA evidence, cell phone records and surveillance footage to tie Kohberger to the stabbings. DNA found on the sheath of a knife left near one of the victims' bodies was a statistical match to Kohberger, authorities previously said.\n\nA police search warrant previously revealed Kohberger's phone was tracked near the students' house at least 12 times in the six months before the attack.\n\nNeighborhood security camera videos also helped police identify a car they said was owned by Kohberger. The car was seen on video at least four times in the early morning hours the day of the killings before speeding off, earlier court filings said.

He pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder.\n\nAccording to ABC News, citing a letter sent to victims' family members informing them of the plea deal, Kohberger agreed to plead guilty to all counts in the killings of the four students. ABC News reported that Kohberger agreed to four consecutive life sentences and waived his right to appeal.\n\nThe letter, according to ABC News, said prosecutors expect Kohberger to be sentenced in late July if a guilty plea is entered as planned at a hearing July 2.

The man did not make contact with her.\n\nInvestigators contacted both men and learned they were trying to meet women at this business. Detectives said they believe this was an isolated incident and not a pattern of stalking and said there was no evidence to suggest the men were involved in the killings.\n\nWednesday, December 7\n\nPolice said this white Hyundai Elantra was spotted near the crime scene early morning of November 13.

The items being removed are “no longer needed for the investigation,” the police department said.\n\nFriday, December 9\n\nMoscow police said they have received an overwhelming number of tips related to their search for a white sedan seen near the crime scene around the time of the killings.\n\nInvestigators were working through more than 6,000 tips they have received over the course of the investigation, Idaho State Police spokesperson Aaron Snell told CNN.\n\nDue to the number of tips received, calls were being directed to an FBI call center to help sort leads received, police said.\n\nMonday, December 12\n\nMoscow Police explained why they have not released more details about the case.\n\n“We are still 100% committed to solving this crime,” Moscow Police Capt. Lanier said in a video update on the investigation.\n\n“We’re not releasing specific details because we do not want to compromise this investigation. It’s what we must do. We owe that to the families, and we owe that to the victims. We want more than just an arrest, we want a conviction,” Lanier said.\n\nLanier’s remarks came as hundreds of University of Idaho students were taking final exams the week before the fall semester ends.\n\n“Our analysts have spent hours sorting through and trying to come up with the most relevant tips first for the investigators to follow up on.

It’s just being left in the dark,” Goncalves said in the interview.\n\nGoncalves also recounted the day she learned something had happened to her daughter.\n\n“We’re running around for hours just not knowing what was going on, what happened,” she said. “… We found out by people calling us. And the sheriff showed up about three hours later.”\n\nGoncalves described learning about the police interest in a white Hyundai sedan seen in the area around the time of the murders not from investigators, but from reading about it in a news release sent to her by someone else.\n\n“My first thought just started being like, how long have they had this information? Where do they get this information? Was it on a camera?” Goncalves said.\n\nTuesday, December 27\n\nTrash recovered from the Kohberger family residence by Pennsylvania law enforcement and sent to the Idaho State Lab for DNA testing was used to help investigators narrow down Bryan Kohberger as the suspect in the Idaho murders, according to court documents released on January 5.\n\nThe next day “the Idaho State Lab reported that a DNA profile obtained from the trash” matched a tan leather knife sheath found “laying on the bed” of one of the victims, according to the documents.\n\n“On December 28, 2022, the Idaho State Lab reported that a DNA profile obtained from the trash and the DNA profile obtained from the sheath, identified a male as not being excluded as the biological father of Suspect Profile,” the document says.\n\n“At least 99.9998% of the male population would be expected to be excluded from the possibility of being the suspect’s biological father.”\n\nThursday, December 29\n\nPolice said they have received about 20,000 tips through more than 9,025 emails, 4,575 phone calls, and 6,050 digital media submissions, while having conducted over 300 interviews in the case of the four students slain in an off-campus home.\n\nThe home where the killings took place will be cleaned up but remain an active crime scene under police control, authorities said.\n\nMoscow police said they have worked with a property management services company to remove “potential biohazards and other harmful substances used to collect evidence,” the update said.

There are no explanations, there is no NOTHING.\"\n\nAt the time of the Idaho college murders, Trump was preparing to announce his re-election bid for the White House. Trump has been previously quiet about this case, but has often put pressure on the judiciary since taking office again in what many are calling a constitutional crisis.\n\nBefore Trump's post, the judge presiding over the case said the court was receiving phone calls to try to influence his decision in the case, according to The Spokesman-Review. The outlet reported he called it \"highly inappropriate.\"\n\nHere is what to know about the case:\n\nWho is Bryan Kohberger?\n\nBryan Kohberger is the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students who were found stabbed to death in a rental house near campus on Nov. 13, 2022.\n\nKohberger, 30, pleaded guilty July 2, 2025, to the murders of Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20, as part of an agreement to avoid the death penalty. The murders rocked the quiet college town of Moscow and set off a weekslong manhunt.\n\nKohberger, who was studying criminal justice at nearby Washington State University at the time, was arrested in Pennsylvania, where his family lives.\n\nKohberger will be handed four consecutive life sentences for the murders, plus 10 years for burglary, according to his plea deal.\n\nWhen is Bryan Kohberger's sentencing?\n\nKohberger's sentencing is scheduled for Wednesday, July 23, at 9 a.m. local time. The hearing \"is expected to last the day,\" with multiple breaks scheduled throughout, the court said.\n\nJudge Steven Hippler said the hearing may stretch into a second day. Families of the victims will be allowed to make statements about the impact of the crimes before the sentence is given. Kohberger will be allowed to make a statement, too, but he is not required to do so.\n\nThe public will be able to watch Kohberger's sentencing in person at the Ada County Courthouse and via livestream, according to the court's website.\n\nTrump wants Kohberger to explain his motive. What do we know about it?\n\nKohberger's plea agreement does not require him to explain his motive. His attorney, Anne Taylor, previously said in a statement to USA TODAY that his defense team will not make any comments or provide any information, even after the sentencing.\n\nBut Hippler recently lifted a long-standing gag order, paving the way for prosecutors, police and others connected to the case to speak out. Hippler also said he plans to review sealed documents in the high-profile case to determine whether they should be made public.\n\nMoscow Police Chief Anthony Dahlinger told ABC News his department also plans to release more information about the case.

Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke, who also lived at the six-bedroom home on Moscow, Idaho's, King Road, survived the attack.\n\nThe plea marked an abrupt end to the shocking and still unexplained murders of the four students, who are the subject of three new projects: “The Idaho Student Murders,” a Peacock documentary that debuted July 3; \"One Night in Idaho: The College Murders,\" an Amazon Prime four-part docuseries that began streaming July 11; and “The Idaho Four,” a book out July 14 by Vicky Ward and James Patterson, an executive producer on “One Night in Idaho.”\n\nIn changing his not-guilty plea for the four counts of first-degree murder, Kohberger, 30, escaped capital punishment. This conclusion satisfies some of the victims’ families while enraging others. For Hunter Johnson, who appears in “One Night in Idaho” and discovered Kernodle and Chapin on that fateful day, the admission brings little relief.\n\n“Even if Kohberger did get the death penalty, that's honestly not even justice enough,” Johnson, a friend of the victims, tells USA TODAY, “because (the families) still don't get to have their daughter. They don't get to have their son.” The irreversible nature of the murders, Johnson says, means justice can never actually be served.\n\nKohberger’s sentencing is scheduled for July 23. As part of the plea deal, the prosecution seeks maximum penalty for the charges, including 10 years for the burglary charge and four consecutive life sentences. Kohberger has waived his right to appeal.\n\n“We are appreciative,” Emily Alandt, Johnson’s girlfriend and close confidant of Kernodle, adds in an interview. She’s happy she and Johnson, their friends and the victims' families have been spared a trial, previously scheduled for August. “That's important to us, and that's the good part that has come out of this.”\n\nAlthough they once avoided interviews out of respect for the families and their own privacy, Alandt and Johnson are speaking out for the first time in \"One Night in Idaho\" at the request of Chapin’s mom, Stacy, Alandt says.\n\nThey want their friends to be thought of as more than how they met their end. “Xana is extremely goofy and giddy all the time,” says Alandt, who remembers Goncalves as “selfless and always smiling.”\n\nJohnson remembers Chapin’s sense of humor. “Ethan was very quirky in the sense that he could make you laugh and very witty all the time,” Johnson says. He describes Mogen as “super caring and outgoing.\"\n\n“They all had a light about them,” Johnson says, “and we just try to carry on that light for them now.”\n\nThe docuseries provides a more complete picture of the four through their social media posts and interviews with friends and family. Mogen’s mom and stepdad participated; so did the parents of Chapin, a triplet, and his siblings.\n\n“I never let Maddie cry, like never,” Karen Laramie recalls heartbreakingly in the docuseries. “I’m not going to let you have a moment of sadness.”\n\nMaizie Chapin shares the final text her brother sent her after attending a sorority formal together on his last night alive. Maizie says Ethan texted “‘I love you,’ which was also weird because we don’t say that to each other.”\n\nLaw enforcement officers and the two surviving roommates could not be interviewed due to gag orders, according to filmmakers.\n\nAt around 11:45 a.m. Nov. 13, according to the docuseries, Mortensen asked Alandt to come check out their house as she’d witnessed something strange. According to an affidavit, Mortensen heard crying and saw a man dressed in black clothes and a mask walk past her.\n\nJohnson, Alandt and Alandt's housemate Josie Lauteren arrived at the King Road house to find Mortensen and her roommate Funke outside the home. Johnson was the first to see the bodies of Kernodle and Chapin and hurried Alandt and Lauteren out of the house and told them to call 911.\n\nKohberger, according to Thompson, the prosecutor, entered the home through the kitchen’s sliding glass door, killed Mogen and Goncalves on the third floor and then killed Kernodle and Chapin on the second floor. Though Kohberger’s motive and connection to his victims are still unknown, Thompson said Kohberger’s cell phone pinged at a tower near the residence approximately 23 times from July 9 to Nov. 7, 2022, between 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.\n\nPeople magazine reported that Kohberger followed his female victims on Instagram, but they did not reciprocate. People also reported that an investigator said Kohberger “allegedly messaged one of the three female victims repeatedly two weeks before the slayings.” Police connected Kohberger to the crime through DNA discovered on the knife sheath left near Mogen’s body.\n\n“The why was a thought for a long time,” Alandt says, “when we didn't know who the killer was … until I saw his face on the internet and had never seen him a day in my life before or ever even heard the name.”\n\n“He's irrelevant,” she adds, “and his story is irrelevant, is what I think.”\n\nThe couple emphasize that Mortensen and Funke have also been traumatized and should not be viewed by internet sleuths as suspects. Some believe and have shared theories on social media that the two survivors are somehow involved with the killings.\n\n“They are just as much victims in this as the other four were,” Johnson says. “People who are harassing them should stop because they still get harassed to this day, even though he's pleaded guilty.”\n\n“Delete your hateful comments,” Alandt urges. “Leave them alone.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/28/bryan-kohberger-murder-trial-alternate-perpetrator/84398705007/", "title": "Bryan Kohberger's 'alternate perpetrator' defense rejected by judge", "text": "June 28, 2025, 12:18 p.m. ET\n\nThe man accused of killing four Idaho college students in 2022 was dealt a blow in court when a judge ruled his defense can't point fingers at other potential suspects because there is no evidence of their connection to the crime.\n\nBryan Kohberger, 30, and his defense team may not pursue what's known in the state of Idaho as an \"alternate perpetrator\" defense by suggesting four other people could be behind the stabbings, a judge ruled on June 26. The murder trial is set to begin in August.\n\nKohberger is charged in the murders of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20. The four were found stabbed to death in their rental house close to the University of Idaho campus on Nov. 13, 2022. Kohberger was arrested in late December of that year, after the town of Moscow was put on edge over the killings and lack of a suspect for weeks.\n\nKohberger's defense attorneys offered four alternate perpetrators, whose identities were kept secret in redacted and sealed court filings. Three of them were \"socially connected\" to one or more of the victims and interacted with them in the hours before the killings, and the fourth had a \"passing connection\" to one victim and followed her briefly while exiting a store but didn't speak to her, the judge's ruling said.\n\nThe judge in Ada County said in his ruling that the defense hadn't met the standard of the 2009 precedent-setting case State v. Meister, which established that alternate perpetrator defenses must comply with the state's rules of evidence.\n\n\"Namely, the evidence is entirely irrelevant,\" Judge Steven Hippler said in his June 26 ruling, adding that there was not a \"scintilla of competent evidence connecting them to the crime.\"\n\nHippler said the three people who knew the victims socially may have had the opportunity to commit the crime because they were familiar with the victims and the layout of their home, but there was no evidence they had motive or means to kill them. Dozens of other people in the victims' social circles probably had the same level of opportunity, Hippler said.\n\n\"They have each cooperated with law enforcement, providing DNA samples, fingerprints and allowing searches as requested. Notably, lab testing has excluded their DNA from samples taken from the crime scene and victims,\" Hippler wrote.\n\nThe fourth person noticed one of the victims shopping about five weeks before the murders and surveillance cameras captured him briefly following her out of a store while considering approaching her to talk, but turning away without speaking to her, the judge said. He also cooperated with law enforcement and his DNA was excluded from the crime scene samples.\n\nHippler wrote that \"it is not sufficient for a defendant to merely offer up unsupported speculation that another person may have committed the crime, which is all Defendant has done here.\"\n\nThe alternate perpetrator evidence brought by the defense would only \"lead the jury astray\" from their focus on whether Kohberger committed the crimes, and could unfairly prejudice the jury and invite them to blame people who are unrepresented at the trial, Hippler said.\n\nThe ruling threw another wrench into Kohberger's defense, which has previously failed at attempts to toss out DNA evidence linking him to the crime scene. Also this week, Hippler denied the defense's request to delay the trial.\n\nWhat evidence connects Kohberger to the crime?\n\nAfter the killings of the four students, investigators testified at the Jan. 23, 2025, hearing that they spent weeks trying to identify a suspect, an unsealed court transcript shows. Their most promising piece of evidence was DNA obtained from the Ka-Bar knife sheath found near some of the victims' bodies.\n\nA police search warrant previously revealed Kohberger's phone was tracked near the students' house at least 12 times in the six months before the attack. Neighborhood security camera videos also helped police identify a car they said was owned by Kohberger. The car was seen on video at least four times in the early morning hours the day of the killings before speeding off, earlier court filings said. Kohberger's defense has previously claimed he was driving alone and not present at the victims' homes.\n\nIn the unsealed transcript, investigators were questioned about how they identified Kohberger using a process called investigative genetic genealogy, a relatively new tool made possible by the rise in popularity of consumer genetic testing through companies like AncestryDNA and 23andMe. They used the process to discover potential relatives of the person whose DNA was on the sheath.\n\nInvestigators later obtained trash from Kohberger's parents' home in Pennsylvania and confirmed DNA found there belonged to the father of the person whose DNA was on the knife sheath. Later still, investigators took a swab from Kohberger's cheek and made a direct comparison.\n\nWhen will the Kohberger trial begin?\n\nJury selection for Kohberger's trial is expected to begin on Aug. 4, 2025. The trial is estimated to begin with opening statements on Aug. 18, Hippler wrote in a scheduling order. The trial was previously scheduled to begin on Aug. 11.\n\nKohberger faces one count of burglary and four counts of murder.

He also scheduled another proceeding for June 18 to assess evidence of the defense’s claim of an alternate suspect, a notion Kohberger’s lawyers first broached last month.\n\nKohberger, 30, was in attendance with them at the hearing, wearing civilian clothes instead of prison attire.\n\nProsecutors have said they will seek the death penalty for the quadruple murders. Death by a firing squad is an option in Idaho, although the state hasn’t carried out an execution since 2012.\n\nHippler said the jury will consider the penalty – life in prison without the possibility of parole or the capital punishment – right after the verdict if the defendant is found guilty.\n\nWhat are the facts surrounding the killings?\n\nPolice say that early in the morning of Nov. 13, 2022, the four college students were stabbed to death at an off-campus house on King Road in Moscow, Idaho, where three of them lived. The victims were identified as Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and her boyfriend Ethan Chapin, 20, who was spending the night.\n\nThe coroner’s report said the victims were probably asleep when they were killed, but some had defensive wounds.\n\nThe killings stunned and frightened the college town of 26,000, where a murder had not been recorded in five years. Fear prevailed for over a month as police failed to find a suspect or a motive.\n\nAfter a manhunt of more than six weeks, Kohberger was arrested Dec. 30, 2022, while visiting his family in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. At the time he was a doctorate student in criminology at Washington State University in Pullman, less than 10 miles west of Moscow.\n\nWhat motivated the attack?\n\nThe motive remains unknown. There’s no indication Kohberger knew any of the victims, and the autopsies did not reveal signs of sexual assault.\n\nIn the absence of an official explanation, theories have filled the void in a case that has spurred true crime podcasts and plenty of speculation, including the suggestion Kohberger was trying to impress an old professor by getting away with murder.\n\nA May 9 report from a reputable outlet, NBC News, said Kohberger had met friends of the victims soon after moving to Pullman, conducted several online searches about serial killer Ted Bundy and had numerous photos of female students from Idaho and Washington State on his cell phone.\n\nThe report also says law enforcement has phone records showing Kohberger made internet searches for “sociopathic traits in college student” and pornography with the words “drugged” and “sleeping.”\n\nWhat all that means probably won’t be known until the trial, if at all.\n\nHave all the evidentiary issues been settled?\n\nNot entirely. Kohberger’s lawyers filed “offer of proof’’ of a possible other perpetrator before Thursday’s proceeding, and Hippler gave then until March 23 to submit any further evidence. He’s expected to rule on that June 18.\n\nThe murder weapon has not been found, so the key piece of evidence for prosecutors is DNA they say matches Kohberger’s that was found on a knife sheath at the scene of the stabbings.\n\nLaw enforcement traced the DNA to Kohberger through investigative genetic genealogy, a process that uses information from a public database where people can upload their own DNA profiles generated by services like Ancestry.com and 23andMe. The DNA was connected to a sample collected at Kohberger’s family home in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe defense filed a motion to suppress that evidence, but Hippler ruled in January that the DNA and records from Kohberger’s cell phone and online accounts could be presented at the trial.\n\nInvestigators say they linked surveillance video to Kohberger’s car, a white Hyundai Elantra seen speeding away at 4:20 a.m. from the area around the house where the bodies were found. Police estimated the homicides took place between 4 and 4:25 a.m.\n\nMore recently, the defense said Kohberger has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and should not be eligible for the death penalty, but Hippler also turned down that request.\n\nThe defense did get a change of venue, from Latah County – where Moscow is located – to Ada County, home to the state capital of Boise.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/22/university-of-idaho-murder-case-bryan-kohberger-timeline/80625554007/", "title": "Timeline: University of Idaho murder case and the arrest of Bryan ...", "text": "March 22, 2025 Updated July 23, 2025, 3:47 p.m. ET\n\nIn November 2022, the brutal murders of four University of Idaho students horrified residents of Moscow, a quiet college town that hadn't reported a murder in five years.\n\nThe students – Ethan Chapin, 20, Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, and Xana Kernodle, 20 – were stabbed to death at a rental home on King Road near campus.

All four victims had returned to the rental house where Mogen, Goncalves and Kernodle lived by 1:45 a.m.\n\nJust before noon, the two surviving roommates woke up and had friends come to the home, believing a victim on the second floor had passed out and wasn't waking, the police reported. A 911 call placed from the home on a roommate's cellphone reported an unconscious person.\n\nAuthorities responded at 11:58 a.m. and found the four students, each stabbed multiple times, on the second and third floors of the residence.\n\nNov. 17-19, 2022: Victims' autopsies conducted\n\nThe Latah County Coroner said the four students were probably asleep when they were killed but that some had defensive wounds. The autopsy report said there was no sign of sexual assault. On Nov. 19, authorities asked the public to provide any video of the home the night of the murder.\n\nNov. 25-29, 2022: Search for white Hyundai Elantra\n\nOn Nov. 25, Moscow Police ask local law enforcement to search for white Elantras. Four days later, WSU police officers find a white Elantra registered to student Bryan Kohberger. Police announced to the public on Dec. 7 they were interested in speaking with a person in a white Hyundai Elantra seen in the immediate area.\n\nNov. 30, 2022: Students hold vigil at University of Idaho\n\nHundreds of students gathered for a vigil in honor of the four students, sponsored by the University of Idaho. \"The only cure to pain is love – it's the only thing that's going to heal us. It's the only thing that's going to heal you,\" said Steve Goncalves, father of Kaylee Goncalves.\n\nDec. 13-16, 2022: Sorting through vehicle information\n\nMoscow police, searching for a Hyundai Elantra seen in the area, announced on Dec. 15 they were sorting through registrations for 22,000 registered Elantras from the model years 2011 to 2013.\n\nKohberger's sedan was captured by a plate reader in Loma, Colorado, on Dec. 13. The car was stopped by law enforcement in Hancock County, Indiana, on Dec. 15. On Dec. 16, the car was seen on surveillance video in Albrightsville, Penn.\n\nDec. 30, 2022: Kohberger's arrest announced\n\nThe FBI and Pennsylvania State Police arrested Kohberger on a fugitive-from-justice warrant at a home in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. Moscow police and Latah County prosecutors held a news conference that afternoon to announce he had been arrested.\n\nProsecutors and police said they were still seeking information from the public and urged anyone who had information about Kohberger or about the case to contact tipline@ci.moscow.id.us or 208-883-7180.\n\nJan. 3, 2023: Kohberger waives right to a hearing\n\nIn a brief afternoon appearance before a judge in a Pennsylvania courtroom, Kohberger declared his mental competency and signed an agreement waiving his right to an extradition hearing, the Pocono Record, a USA TODAY Network newspaper, reported. He briefly acknowledged his parents and two sisters before being escorted from the room.\n\nJan. 4, 2023: Kohberger extradited back to Idaho\n\nKohberger was flown by Pennsylvania State Police to a small airport near the Idaho border, where uniformed law enforcement officers were waiting. Kohberger was seen handcuffed, in a red jumpsuit being handed over to local authorities and escorted to a caravan of five vehicles.\n\nJan. 5, 2023: New facts emerge with documents released\n\nOfficials released a 19-page statement of facts used to obtain the arrest warrant for Kohberger. It details a timeline of what happened inside the King Road residence and states DNA found on a knife sheath in the home was connected to DNA collected at Kohberger's family home in Pennsylvania.\n\nKohberger also made his first appearance in court in Moscow.\n\nFeb. 28, 2023: Authorities unseal Pennsylvania search warrant\n\nAuthorities unseal a copy of the search warrant authorization for Pennsylvania State Police to search the Kohberger family home in late December. Documents show police seized the following items from Kohberger that night: four medical-style gloves, a white T-shirt, a Champion sweatshirt, a pair of size 13 Nike shoes, black shorts, boxers and socks, all from Under Armour.\n\nMay 22, 2023: Arraignment\n\nKohberger is arraigned on charges he fatally stabbed the four students. On Kohberger's behalf, Judge John Judge entered a \"not guilty\" plea in the four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary. A preliminary hearing scheduled for June 26 was vacated. Kohberger is being held without bail in Idaho.\n\nJune 26, 2023: Seeking the death penalty\n\nIdaho prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty in the case. Considering \"all evidence currently known to the State, the State is compelled to file this notice of intent to seek the death penalty,\" court documents state.\n\nSept. 1, 2023: Hearing scheduled\n\nA trial date was originally scheduled for Oct. 2, 2023, but Kohberger waived his right to a speedy trial in August and his defense attorney said the case required more time.\n\nDec. 28, 2023: Home demolished\n\nDuring winter break at the University of Idaho, a demolition began of the home where the murders took place, over the objections of some of the victims' family members.\n\nSept. 12, 2024\n\nIdaho Supreme Court grants a request from Kohberger's defense attorneys to move the trial venue to Boise, Idaho in Ada County, and to transfer Kohberger to the custody of the Ada County Sheriff.\n\nNov. 19, 2024\n\nJudge denies motions by defense attorneys to strike the death penalty.\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nIdaho Judge Steven Hippler ruled DNA evidence from the knife sheath and records from Kohberger's cellphone and online accounts obtained through search warrants could be included at trial.\n\nMarch 2025\n\nDetails released in March show the two surviving roommates, initially believed to be sleeping, were panicking when they believed a shadowy figure was in the home the night of the killings.\n\nAuthorities also released details on the 911 call.\n\nProsecutors in Latah County, Idaho asked a judge to let them present his online shopping patterns at trial, with evidence that he bought the military-style knife, a sheath and a sharpener on Amazon months before the deaths.\n\nBryan Kohberger allegedly bought military-style knife in months before Idaho student stabbings\n\nJune 2025\n\nKohberger accepted a plea deal in the case that would spare him the death penalty. The case calendar for the state of Idaho had stated jury selection was scheduled to start Aug. 4.\n\nJuly 2, 2025\n\nIdaho judge Steven Hippler accepted the plea arrangement, which had prompted mixed reactions from the victims' families. When asked during the hearing if he had committed the murders willfully and with premeditation, Kohberger replied: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe Goncalves family released a statement, saying: \"This plea did not represent the victims’ families, it represented an easy way out and no answers.\"\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n\nIn handing down the four consecutive life sentences and noting that Kohberger had shown no remorse or recognition of the pain he caused, Hippler called him \"the worst of the worst.”\n\n“Even if we could get truthful insight into his why, I suspect it would not in any way quench one’s thirst for actually understanding why,\" Hippler said. \"Because there is no reason for these crimes that could approach anything resembling rationality.\"\n\nDylan Mortensen, a surviving roommate who was in the home that night, struggled to contain her emotions as she described the panic attacks and grief she has experienced in \"reliving everything over and over again.\"\n\n\"What happened that night changed everything,\" Mortensen said. \"Because of him four beautiful, genuine, compassionate people were taken from this world for no reason.\"\n\nContributing: N'dea Yancey-Bragg, Christopher Cann and Michael Loria.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/22"}]}

The brazen theft happened at a home in New York City.\n\nThe day before that theft in New York, police said someone across the country broke into the Oakland Museum of California’s off-site storage facility and snatched more than 1,000 items including jewelry, laptops, Native American baskets and other historic artifacts.\n\nThe two recent U.S. thefts highlight how attractive high-value targets have become for criminals, who have recently targeted museums, luxury retailers as well as the rich and famous.\n\nAll kinds of valuable items ‒ artwork, handbags, watches, baseball cards, even rare cheese and wine ‒ make attractive targets for thieves because their worth has increased drastically with time, according to Robert Wittman, a retired FBI agent who founded the bureau's international art crime team.\n\n\"What I see today is that high value assets are being stolen quite often, and the reason for that is because of the value...the inflation of the values has created an interest in the criminal community,\" said Wittman.\n\nSkilled crews have stolen treasure worth millions\n\nJust hours after the infamous Louvre heist, another French museum was robbed of 2,000 silver and gold coins worth more than $100,000. At least four other French museums have been robbed in the last two months, according to media reports.\n\nWittman and other art crime experts said museum thefts like these targeting gems and gold pieces that can be easily broken down and sold have been on the rise. While museums are often vulnerable in part because they are notoriously hard to secure, they aren't the only target.\n\nIn June, federal authorities filed charges against seven men for stealing more than $100 million worth of diamonds, Rolex watches and emeralds from a Brink's semitruck in Southern California in what's been called the \"largest jewelry heist in U.S. history.\"\n\nThe Jewelry Security Alliance, a nonprofit trade association, found that while the number of robberies, burglaries, and other thefts targeting the U.S. jewel industry declined in 2024, the amount of money lost rose to an estimated total of $142.5 million, because the severity of losses from sophisticated burglary crews was so great.\n\nHighly organized crews are also believed to be behind a string of recent burglaries targeting famous athletes, including NFL stars Joe Burrow, Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. In February, seven men were charged in connection with the theft of more than $2 million in cash and luxury items from athletes' homes.\n\nThe FBI warned the people responsible are part of a sophisticated group who conduct thorough technical and physical surveillance prior to each break-in.\n\n\"These preparation tactics enable theft groups to conduct burglaries in a short amount of time. Organized theft groups bypass alarm systems, use Wi-Fi jammers to block Wi-Fi connections and disable devices, cover security cameras and obfuscate their identities,\" the FBI said.\n\nContributing: Jon Hoefling, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/10/23/louvre-thieves-escape-video/86856017007/", "title": "See video of apparent Louvre thieves escaping after heist", "text": "Oct. 23, 2025, 2:10 p.m. ET\n\nA new video appears to show thieves escaping Paris' Louvre museum after stealing more than $100 million worth of jewels.\n\nOn Oct. 19, robbers shattered a window and stole eight pieces of jewelry before escaping on motorbikes, French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said on France Inter radio.\n\nThe pieces, which are from the Galerie d'Apollon, a first-floor wing of the museum that houses hardstone jewels, diamonds and crowns won by French royals, are worth $102 million, Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau told RTL radio on Oct. 21.\n\nAfter the heist, the museum was closed for the rest of the day on Sunday, Oct. 19, and the full day on Monday, Oct. 20. It was closed as usual on Tuesday, Oct. 21, before reopening on Oct. 22.\n\nLaurence des Cars, the Louvre's president and director, testified before the French Senate's Culture, Education and Sport Committee on Oct. 22 about the heist. des Cars said she tendered her resignation following the incident, but was refused by Culture Minister Rachida Dati.\n\n\"We did not detect the thieves' arrival early enough,\" des Cars said during the hearing.\n\nVideo appears to show Louvre robbers after heist\n\nA video that began circulating on Oct. 23 shows two people moving down an extendable ladder on a side of the Louvre.\n\nThe individuals, whose faces are not identifiable, appear to be wearing all-black outfits. One sports a reflective jacket, similar to the ones worn by construction workers.\n\nWhen contacted about the video on Thursday, Oct. 23, the Paris Prosecutor's office told USA TODAY it does not have new updates to share regarding the investigation.\n\nWatch the video at the top of this story.\n\nHow did robbers break into the Louvre?\n\nAccording to French officials, the heist occurred at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Oct. 19. Four suspects drove a truck with a powered extendable ladder and stopped on a road near the Seine River on the Louvre’s south side.\n\nLouvre heist: How thieves stole treasures worth millions in just seven minutes\n\nTwo suspects then extended the ladder and climbed to a second-floor balcony of the museum while the other two suspects remained with the truck, according to officials. They used power tools to break through a window leading to the Galerie d'Apollon.\n\nOnce inside, they smashed glass display cases and snatched the items as alarms sounded and the museum staff evacuated tourists, officials said.\n\nThe two suspects descended the ladder and all four escaped on two motorbikes, according to officials.\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Under strict orders not to engage with the intruders, all they could do was call the police and monitor the thieves on grainy security footage from a nearby room. In eight chaotic minutes, it was over.\n\nAround 5 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2019, the thieves set fire to a circuit breaker directly across the street from their target. The fire disabled the alarm system, turned off the surrounding streetlights and cut all power to the Grünes Gewölbe museum − the Green Vault in Dresden, Germany − plunging the whole area into darkness.\n\nMoments later, two black-clad hooded figures emerged from the shadows and sprinted toward a small window on the museum's ground floor with an iron grille over it. Days earlier, the thieves had used a hydraulic tool to cut through a large section of the iron bars and then reattached them with glue to avoid suspicion. On the night of the heist itself, they used a small ax to smash through the window and crawl inside. Using flashlights to light their way, they headed straight to display cases housing one of Europe's largest collections of fine art, historic jewels and artifact treasures with priceless cultural value.\n\nThey escaped with a stash that included a 62-carat diamond, a diamond-encrusted sword, a brooch with 660 gemstones, a diamond hat clasp and epaulette, and a Maltese cross of red rubies. The value of the items was estimated at more than $130 million.\n\nThe heist in Dresden's Green Vault was Europe’s most notorious smash-and-grab art theft − until the Louvre Museum in Paris was ransacked Oct. 19.\n\nThieves made off with eight items of Napoleonic and royal jewelry worth an estimated $100 million in broad daylight, according to French officials. Four more suspects were arrested on Nov. 25 for a crime that French President Emmanuel Macron has described as an attack on \"our history.\" Four people have already been charged − three men and a woman, all from the Paris area − for complicity in organized theft and criminal conspiracy. Laure Beccuau, the Paris prosecutor, has said the jewels have not yet been recovered and that the heist was likely carried out by petty criminals rather than organized crime professionals.\n\nSeven minutes: How thieves stole treasures worth millions from the Louvre\n\nBut the raid in Paris last month is far from the first museum heist. The one in Dresden eventually was solved through German police work with help from an Israeli security and intelligence firm.\n\nIn fact, such heists are part of a broader trend of increasingly professionalized art, museum and jewelry thefts by criminal networks in recent years. And they are happening far more in Europe than in the United States, according to police data, independent studies and former and current investigators who spoke to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Europe is under siege,\" said Christopher Marinello, whose London-and-Rome-based firm Art Recovery International has recovered stolen and missing works of art valued at more than $600 million on behalf of museums, collectors, dealers, artists, governments, insurance companies and religious institutions.\n\nThe theft of artwork and other culturally important items often unfolds in an underground world involving highly trained bandits with ties to organized crime. To crack the cases, investigators rely on secret informants, monitor the black market and hidden parts of the internet to see if the missing items have been offered for sale, and even pose as buyers to catch the culprits and, with luck, retrieve the stolen goods.\n\nIn 2021, there were nearly 10,000 reported crimes involving cultural property all over the world, according to Interpol, the international police agency based in Lyon, France. More than half took place in Europe, where 18,000 objects such as rare coins, paintings, sculptures and archaeological objects were stolen from public and private collections. Just 772 items were taken that year in North and South America, said the report, which did not break out the statistics for individual countries.\n\nLouvre heist investigation: French police make more arrests\n\nA separate report published in April by the International Journal of Cultural Property cited 40 of the most significant art heists of the past three decades. Thirty-one happened in Europe. Only two took place in the United States (at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990 and the Jewish Museum in New York in 2001).\n\nWhy art thefts happen more often in Europe\n\nMarinello and other security experts said several factors have combined to make Europe fertile ground for heists and cultural theft. These include relatively porous and proximate borders, meager investment in museum security, light prison sentences for convicted thieves, and a preponderance of gangs with ties to Eastern Europe, where law enforcement is comparatively \"sparse\" compared with elsewhere in Europe.\n\nEastern Europe is also physically closer to newer generations of wealthy buyers in the Middle East and Asia. Marinello said that all 15 of the watches he has recovered recently − some worth up to $600,000 or more − have surfaced in places such as Estonia, Romania, Slovakia and Serbia.\n\nBut those aren't the only reasons these types of thefts happen more often in Europe.\n\nInvestigators and other experts note that many of the museums in Europe are huge, ancient buildings and are therefore fiendishly difficult to secure because they were never intended to serve as museums.\n\nLouvre heist sounds like a movie plot: Here's what Hollywood gets wrong\n\nThe Green Vault theft in Dresden took place on the grounds of the Dresden Royal Palace, a sprawling castle complex that was once home to kings and is one of the oldest buildings in the city. It dates to the 15th century.\n\nJust two men, one van and 50 seconds were needed for Norway's 19th-century National Gallery − subsequently merged with the hyper-modern National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design − to temporarily lose Edvard Munch's painting \"The Scream\" to thieves in the early hours of Feb. 12, 1994. It was stolen as the country was preparing for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics.\n\nA truck-mounted ladder, a couple of small chainsaws and box cutters were all it took for the masked thieves in Paris to slip through the window of the Louvre's Galerie d'Apollon − Gallery of Apollo − on Oct. 19 and make off with an emerald-studded necklace and a pair of earrings given by Napoleon I to his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise, on their wedding night. They also stole a tiara that belonged to Napoleon III’s third wife, Empress Eugénie. It is dotted with more than 200 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds.\n\nThe Louvre's grandiosity, as in other heist cases in Europe, was not a friend to its security.\n\nThe Louvre, the world's most-visited museum, is a former palace along the Seine River in central Paris that was converted to a museum by the French government in 1793 after the French Revolution. Its collection contains more than 500,000 works, including a dizzying array of paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and jewelry. About 35,000 of the items are on display at any particular time in the museum’s eight departments.\n\nThe Louvre’s size alone makes it hard to secure every room. It has more than 780,000 square feet of public exhibition space. That's more than double the size of the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, whose collection includes the Hope Diamond and other precious jewels. The Louvre's building structure is adorned with windows of various shapes and sizes.\n\n\"If you’ve ever been (at the Louvre), you’ve seen how exhausting it can be to spend a day in that museum,\" said Ronnie Walker, a former FBI agent who specialized in recovering stolen art items.\n\nWhere are the jewels? Stolen Louvre loot worth $102 million may be melted down\n\nThe Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, testified before the French Senate after the heist that there was inadequate security camera coverage outside the museum's walls. The balcony where the thieves entered the Gallery of Apollo was not monitored by any cameras. The one surveillance camera in the area where the thieves parked their truck was pointed the wrong way. An internal audit also showed that some rooms inside the museum itself were not covered by security cameras.\n\nWalker said that while it would be technically possible to equip every room in the Louvre with closed-circuit television cameras, the cost and the manpower needed to monitor such a security system would render any such endeavor highly impractical. \"Even if they had every square inch of that museum covered with CCTV, it wouldn’t have prevented what happened. It would have just documented it,\" Walker said, noting that American museums are often purpose-built with security in mind.\n\nDave Bass is a former FBI agent who was an original member of the agency’s Art Crime Team. Since its founding in 2004, the unit has recovered more than 20,000 items valued at more than $1 billion, according to the FBI's website. When museums are built in modern times, Bass said, a lot of thought goes into the security perimeter. New museums are often placed at a distance from streets or alleys, creating a barrier that makes it harder for thieves to quickly enter the building, steal valuable items and flee.\n\n\"In the case of the Louvre,\" Bass said, \"you literally have a wall separating the contents of the museum from the street outside. That’s not an ideal perimeter.\"\n\nWalker said that it would not be as easy to pull up a bucket truck or construction ladder outside U.S. museums as it was at the Louvre. More modern U.S. museums, he said, tend to be smaller than the grand museums of Europe, are often boxlike structures with few windows, and typically are designed with a more open floor plan, which makes it a lot easier for security guards to watch for trouble.\n\nAmerican art theft exceptionalism?\n\nStill, that does not mean the United States is immune to heists.\n\nThe Holy Grail of unsolved art thefts is, in fact, an American one, according to investigators such as Geoffrey Kelly, who for two decades led the FBI's investigation into the 1990 theft at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, which opened in 1903 as a Venetian-style palazzo.\n\nThe stolen works, including Rembrandt's painting \"Christ in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee\" and works from Vermeer and a Manet, are valued at $500 million, which makes the heist the largest art theft in American history.\n\nKelly retired in 2024 and is now a partner at Argus Cultural Property Consultants.\n\nNo one has been charged with the Boston theft despite a $10 million reward. The FBI announced in 2013 that it believes the thieves were two local criminals who died shortly after the heist.\n\nIt declined to identify them. None of the artwork has been recovered.\n\nAnthony Amore, an art theft expert who is now the museum’s director of security, said the investigation continues and authorities are still receiving leads.\n\nArt investigations are different from those of other crimes, Amore and other experts said, because catching the culprits isn’t the main objective.\n\n“When someone steals money from a bank, it’s just money. You want to catch the individuals to stop them from doing it again,” said Robert Wittman, who as founder and senior investigator for the FBI’s Art Crime Team helped recover stolen art and cultural property worth millions.\n\n“But when someone steals a valuable painting or unique jewelry, with all its cultural heritage and history, it becomes more important to recover the stolen art and jewelry than it is to actually catch anybody.”\n\nWittman, who helped recover stolen works by Rembrandt, Norman Rockwell and Francisco de Goya, said missing art is not just property.\n\n“It wasn’t a Ford, or it wasn’t a Chevrolet,” he said. “It was a Monet.”\n\nMuseum security is a 'never-ending debate'\n\nSecurity funding remains an issue for many museums everywhere. Most museums in the United States are privately owned and funded, while the Louvre is owned by and receives substantial funding from the French government. Private donations and sponsorships and the Louvre’s activities, like merchandizing and licensing and hosting private events and galas, also feed the museum’s budget.\n\nEven so, \"museums are not cash-rich like people think,\" Amore said.\n\n\"They don’t have all the money in the world to spend on security.\"\n\nSo decisions must be made. Priorities must be set.\n\n\"There’s this never-ending debate between museum leadership and their security department director, and that debate is: How do we secure our collection, and how do we maintain public access and fulfill our mission?\" said Bass, the former FBI agent from the agency's art crime team.\n\nBass recently teamed up with Walker, his former FBI colleague, to form the Art Legacy Institute, an educational and research nonprofit that works to help artists protect their work from fraud, forgery or misattribution, which happens when a piece of artwork is incorrectly credited to a particular artist or time period. Fraud and forgery is a common problem in the art world, with some experts estimating that up to half of the art on the market today could involve forgeries or misattributions.\n\nThe job of a museum, Walker said, is to be open to the public so everyone can enjoy the historically significant items in its collection.\n\n\"Ultimately,\" he said, \"their mission is education. And if they want to be 100% secure, they’re not going to be a very good museum.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona/2022/06/16/antique-dealers-who-found-stolen-willem-de-kooning-painting-honored/7611863001/", "title": "Antique dealers who found stolen Willem de Kooning painting ...", "text": "June 16, 2022, 9:00 a.m. ET\n\nLOS ANGELES — David Van Auker and Buck Burns stepped off an elevator and into a second-floor gallery at the J. Paul Getty Museum.\n\nIt was a Friday night, a time when the renowned museum is typically closed to visitors.\n\nBut they weren't just any visitors.\n\nIn 2017, as co-owners of a furniture and antiques store in Silver City, New Mexico, they made national news when they discovered a stolen Willem de Kooning painting in an estate sale and returned it to its rightful owners at the University of Arizona Museum of Art.\n\nNow, on this Friday evening, they were about to see the painting for the first time since it had undergone conservation work at the Getty. They were accompanied by current and former museum staff and Getty painting conservators. Everyone chatted excitedly as they poured off the elevator, their voices echoing off the walls. They shared a special bond: A famous painting they were all connected to was back on exhibit after 37 years.\n\nIn the room's center was \"Woman-Ochre,\" an oil-on-canvas painting estimated to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nVan Auker and Burns were silent as they gazed at the painting. Burns shook his head and smiled. Van Auker put his hand over his heart. They stepped closer. The painting, made in the winter of 1954-55, depicts a nude woman with a grimaced face. The Dutch-American artist de Kooning used vivid hues of yellow, turquoise and crimson and a distinctive, gestural brush stroke.\n\n\"Wow,\" Van Auker said, wiping his eyes. \"I'm speechless.\"\n\nThe crowd clapped and cheered.\n\nFor subscribers: The saga of Arizona's famous stolen de Kooning painting. New details paint picture of alleged thieves\n\n\"Olivia, come here,\" Van Auker said, gesturing to Olivia Miller, curator of the university art museum. She was the person who accepted a phone call on Aug. 3, 2017, from Van Auker when he thought he had found the museum's stolen de Kooning. They have since become fast friends. On Friday, she hugged Van Auker and Burns, as they celebrated another milestone in the painting's long journey back to the public eye.\n\n\"I love you guys,\" she said.\n\nBurns thanked the Getty for the work. Then everyone took turns posing in front of \"Woman-Ochre,\" taking group photos and selfies.\n\n\"What's interesting to me is the way this painting, this project, has kind of gathered people around it,\" said Andy Schulz, the university's vice president for the Arts and dean of the College of Fine Arts, during brief remarks before the private viewing.\n\nFriendships have formed among current and former museum staffers, conservators at the Getty Museum and scientists at the Getty Conservation Institute. They all share a bond, a connection, over a work of art.\n\nFor subscribers: $100 million de Kooning was recovered in 2017. New details paint picture of alleged thieves\n\n\"Woman-Ochre\" was donated to the university in 1958 and was considered a jewel in the museum's collection. When it wasn't on exhibit, it was on loan to other museums. Then, in 1985, it was stolen on the day after Thanksgiving in a brazen heist and remained missing for more than 30 years.\n\nThe Silver City antique dealers picked up the painting in August 2017 as part of an estate sale in a nearby town and, after customers began inquiring about whether it was a real de Kooning, Van Auker started Googling and came across an Arizona Republic article about the theft. He called the museum right away. Within days, \"Woman-Ochre\" was back home.\n\nMiller said on Friday that although the theft showed the worst side of people, the recovery and conservation represent \"the best parts of people.\" Many people played a role in getting the painting back and enabling the art to be on exhibit again, she said.\n\nVan Auker and Burns last saw the painting in March 2019, during an invitation-only, one-night exhibit at the university art museum. Then the painting was moved from Tucson to the Getty for research, analysis and repairs.\n\nGetty scientists and conservators quickly discovered the 40-inch tall by 30-inch wide painting had been terribly damaged. Horizontal cracks marred the surface, where the thieves had cut the painting out with a sharp object — possibly a box cutter — and ripped it from a backing canvas. The painting had been covered with two layers of varnish, obscuring the vivid colors and giving a grayish or yellowish tint.\n\nThe Getty undertook the project at no charge to the university in exchange for being able to display the de Kooning for a few months after conservators finished their work. The work took nearly three years. The exhibit, \"Conserving de Kooning: Theft and Recovery,\" opened June 7 and runs through Aug. 28.\n\nThe focus is back on the painting, not the damage, said Ulrich Birkmaier, the Getty Museum's senior conservator of paintings. You can still see traces of the painting's tumultuous history if you look closely, he said. But more importantly, the painting \"reads\" well again and has aged gracefully.\n\nHe told the assembled crowd on Friday, over appetizers of shrimp cocktail and empanadas, that it is heartwarming to see so many people who are so closely connected to the painting. Referring to the antique dealers, he said:\n\n\"We're just in awe of everything you've done for the painting.\"\n\nThe antique dealers found \"Woman-Ochre\" in the bedroom of a deceased, retired couple, Jerry and Rita Alter, who lived in rural Cliff, New Mexico. Jerry Alter had been a music teacher, Rita Alter a school speech pathologist. The couple spent nearly every vacation traveling to exotic locations. The FBI won't comment on whether the couple were the thieves.\n\nBut circumstantial evidence links the Alters to the crime: A family photograph places the couple in Tucson on Thanksgiving Day in 1985, the day before the theft. The photo eerily resembles a composite sketch of the thieves. Witnesses said the thieves drove a red car; the Alters had purchased a red Toyota Supra earlier that year, according to their travel journal.\n\nThe painting likely hung in their bedroom for years because heavy dust had accumulated on the gold commercial frame. It was behind a bedroom door so it could only be seen from inside the bedroom, when the door was closed.\n\nBy contrast at the Getty, \"Woman-Ochre\" is now viewed by a steady stream of visitors. They stop to read about painting's conservation and watch a short video about the theft and repairs. The now-famous painting is in good company. Just around the corner is a gallery with several Rembrandt paintings, including the famous \"Rembrandt Laughing.\"\n\nFinding the de Kooning has been a life-changing experience for the Silver City antique dealers.\n\nAt least once a week, someone will come into Manzanita Ridge, their 10,000-square-foot store, and ask about the stolen painting. Van Auker never tires of telling the story. It’s the most exciting thing that has ever happened to him. He has been interviewed more times than he can count. People have called the store, just to say, \"thank you.\"\n\nSo many years have passed, no one at the university quite remembers the details of the $10,000 reward that was originally offered for the painting's return. The antique dealers said they wouldn’t accept one anyway.\n\nThe university gave them the gold frame that once housed the de Kooning after it was stolen. Van Auker proudly hung the empty frame in the guest house he and Burns own, in the same spot where they originally intended to hang the de Kooning before finding out it was real and stolen.\n\nThe Getty exhibit was something Van Auker and Burns looked forward to for weeks. They bought new clothes. Van Auker lost weight. They took time off work so they could fly to Los Angeles. Their third business partner, Rick Johnson, stayed in Silver City to care for his mother and four dogs. But he is planning to see the painting when it goes on exhibit in Tucson.\n\nVan Auker and Burns were especially excited to see a photograph of themselves and Johnson and their names displayed in the Getty exhibit. The photo caption reads, \"A 2017 photo of the three antique dealers who called the FBI after they realized they had purchased a stolen painting (left to right): Rick Johnson, Buck Burns, and David Van Auker, all of Silver City, New Mexico.\"\n\nVan Auker and Burns took a selfie in front of the photo of themselves, being careful not to block Johnson's head so they could all three appear in the photo.\n\nOnce that was done, Van Auker was no longer speechless.\n\n\"I'm absolutely blown away,\" he said, his eyes still wet with tears. \"I had no idea I would have this kind of emotion seeing it finished. I'm honored, touched. I'm so thrilled I got to be part of this.\"\n\nAnd the journey is not over.\n\n\"Woman-Ochre\" will come back to Tucson for exhibit, beginning Oct. 8.\n\nRepublic reporter Anne Ryman was the first journalist to break the story that \"Woman-Ochre\" had been recovered and has written extensively about the painting.

Clues emerge in theft of $100M 'Woman ...", "text": "Aug. 1, 2018, 2:15 p.m. ET\n\n\"Woman-Ochre\" found 31 years later in house of deceased, retired couple.\n\nNewly discovered photo shows couple was visiting family in Tucson when theft happened in same city.\n\nFBI has not closed the case.\n\nJerry and Rita Alter spent Thanksgiving Day 1985 with family in Tucson.\n\nA newly discovered photo from the gathering shows them smiling side by side at the dinner table, plates of pumpkin pie in front of them.\n\nJerry was a retired music teacher and Rita a speech pathologist; a couple of New Yorkers in their 50s who had moved to rural New Mexico.\n\nA day after the photo was taken, a valuable painting by the artist Willem de Kooning was taken from the University of Arizona Museum of Art in Tucson. Officials believed the thieves — a man and a woman — distracted a guard, cut the painting from the frame, rolled it up and carried it out of the museum under a coat.\n\nThe thieves and the painting disappeared without a trace.\n\nComposite sketches, in hindsight, resemble the faces in the Thanksgiving photo, down to their position side by side.\n\nNo one would have made the connection at the time. But three decades later, the painting, “Woman-Ochre,” turned up in the Alters’ New Mexico home, discovered by accident in the master bedroom following the couple's death.\n\nNo one handling the Alters' estate was aware of the background or value of the oil abstract of a nude woman. But when the home's furnishings were sold to a local antiques shop for $2,000, customers immediately recognized it as the work of de Kooning.\n\nThe painting is thought to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nAugust marks the first full year since the painting's recovery. In the 12 months since, clues have emerged that might explain how an unassuming, retired couple came into possession of the artwork.\n\nRita Alter's nephew and executor of their estate, Ron Roseman, recently discovered the Thanksgiving Day photo while going through family photos and shared it with The Arizona Republic.\n\nRoseman said he doesn't want to believe his beloved aunt and uncle might have been involved in a major art theft.\n\n\"We have no idea when they got it, how they got it, if they were involved, if they bought it from someone. Ultimately there’s a lot of coincidence,\" he told The Republic.\n\nThe Alters, it turns out, left other interesting clues, or coincidences, besides the Thanksgiving Day photo.\n\nThe FBI has declined to discuss the de Kooning case until it's resolved.\n\nA red car\n\nUniversity police didn't find much evidence at the museum crime scene. The museum had no video cameras. Police found no traces of fingerprints.\n\nOne witness did say whoever took the painting drove off in a rust-colored sports car.\n\nThe Alters almost exclusively drove red cars, their nephew said. \"All their cars over the years, but one, was red. They had one blue car,\" Roseman said.\n\nA composite sketch of the thieves show the woman wearing a scarf and “granny” glasses.\n\nThe man was described as 25 to 30 years old with curly hair, an olive complexion, thick mustache and glasses.\n\nThe woman may have been a man in disguise, said UA Police Chief Brian Seastone, who was the lead detective on the case before it was turned over to the FBI.\n\nThe Alters have two adult children but they have not been able to shed light on how their parents obtained the painting, Roseman said. Neither could be reached for comment by The Republic.\n\nThe family photo taken Thanksgiving Day 1985 in Tucson shows the Alters' son, 23-year-old Joseph, at the table with his parents and other family members.\n\nAbout six months ago, Roseman said he showed a photo of \"Woman-Ochre\" to Joseph to see if he might remember or have anything to say about the painting.\n\nRoseman said his cousin laughed for about 30 seconds when he saw the painting.\n\n\"Why are you laughing?\" Roseman asked him.\n\n\"That's one of the ugliest paintings I've ever seen,\" Alter told him.\n\nThe Alters liked art\n\nRoseman likes to imagine his aunt and uncle acquired the stolen painting in a not-so-nefarious way.\n\nJerry Alter, a professional musician and a band teacher in New York City schools, left teaching at 47. Roseman said the couple decided to \"get out of the rat race\" and moved to rural New Mexico in 1977.\n\nJerry drew up blueprints and hired contractors to build a ranch-style house atop a mesa on 20 acres in Cliff, a blink-and-you-miss-it town of fewer than 300 people. Rita Alter started work as a speech pathologist for the local school district, Silver Consolidated Schools.\n\nThey frequented art museums, which leads Roseman to another possible scenario on how his aunt and uncle ended up with the de Kooning.\n\nThey could have been at an art exhibit or art gallery, he said, when someone approached them and said, \"I have something better in my garage.\"\n\nHe surmises the Alters could have bought the painting under the belief it was either an original de Kooning or a good copy.\n\nDavid Van Auker is co-owner of the antique shop that inadvertently purchased the stolen de Kooning as part of the Alters' estate sale. He has a theory about how long the painting was in the Alters' home.\n\nVan Auker said the painting was \"hidden\" from guests behind a door in their master bedroom — as if the couple didn't want anyone but themselves to see it. He found cobwebs and dust when he examined the painting as he was looking over objects in the home in early August 2017.\n\nWhen the painting was removed from the wall, it left an outline on the wall where the frame had hung, indicating the work had been there for some time.\n\n\"I honestly believe that it had been there since the day it was stolen,\" he said.\n\nThe Alters also apparently took steps to safeguard the valuable work.\n\nA camera team from WFAA television station in Dallas was able to enter the Alters' former home for a 2017 documentary on the de Kooning theft.\n\nThey examined the area where the painting had hung. On the baseboard, they spotted a thick screw, blocking the door from opening all the way and damaging the painting.\n\nA veiled confession?\n\nThe Alters were deeply in love, said Roseman, their nephew. When he was going through the contents of their estate, he found love letters they had written to each other, even into old age.\n\nThey met in 1955 or 1956 at a hotel in the Catskill Mountains, where H. Jerome \"Jerry\" played clarinet in a jazz band and Rita Sinofsky had gone to be a waitress. When Rita got there, however, she discovered there wasn't a job opening, so she went to a café to mull over her predicament.\n\nThat's where Jerry spotted her, decided she was the one and struck up a conversation, Roseman said. They married a year or two later.\n\nThey would fly to exotic vacations during school breaks, visiting more than 140 countries and taking some 13,000 slides.\n\nThe Alters wrote three books together, one about traveling, another about poetry and a twist on Aesop's Fables.\n\n\"The Cup and The Lip: Exotic Tales\" features fictional accounts of travel adventures. In one story, \"Eye of the Jaguar,\" a grandmother and her granddaughter case a local city museum and then return to steal its prize exhibit, a 120-carat emerald.\n\nThe thieves leave behind no clues. The jewel is kept hidden \"several miles away\" from the museum, behind a secret panel, \"and two pairs of eyes, exclusively, are there to see!\" he wrote.\n\nThe details are similar to the de Kooning theft.\n\nRoseman said he read parts of his uncle's book five or six years ago. At the time, though, he would have had no inkling a stolen painting was behind their bedroom door, where only the Alters could see it.\n\nIt wasn't until after the famous painting was recovered, Roseman said, that a New York Times reporter, researching a story about the painting's recovery, brought to Roseman's attention the emerald-theft story's similarities to the de Kooning theft.\n\nPainting may not have changed hands\n\nThe recovered de Kooning, now safely back at the university, holds a few clues to its travels.\n\nUA museum officials believe the painting was reframed only once after being stolen, a possible sign the work of art hadn't passed through multiple owners.\n\nThe painting was mounted in a gold commercial frame. Someone crudely stretched the canvas and screwed it into the frame, methods inconsistent with professional framing.\n\nRoseman, who is a high school computer teacher, said he was close to his aunt and uncle, especially during the late 1970s and early '80s when he was a student at the University of Arizona. He visited them about once a month in Cliff, which is about 225 miles east of Tucson.\n\nAfter he graduated college, he visited less frequently.\n\nJerry Alter died in 2012. He was 81.\n\nA few years later, Rita Alter started showing signs of dementia. She placed dozens of sticky notes inside her car to remind herself how to drive with instructions such as, \"press the middle pedal to stop the car.\"\n\nRoseman, who lives in Houston, and other family members made plans for round-the-clock care in January 2017, so she could remain in her home. That's when Roseman first saw the painting behind the door of the master bedroom. But like others, he didn't recognize the work as being valuable or stolen.\n\nRoseman considered himself pretty close to his aunt and uncle. They were worldly and fascinating. And he loved hearing about their travels.\n\nBut after the events of the past year, he was \"not close enough evidently,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nHow the de Kooning was recovered\n\nRita Alter died in June 2017 at age 81. Roseman, the estate's executor, arranged to clear out and sell the house.\n\nManzanita Ridge Furniture & Antiques in nearby Silver City purchased furniture, African art objects and a couple of paintings, including the as-yet-unidentified de Kooning. Silver City is known for its vibrant arts district.\n\nDavid Van Auker, one of the shop's owners, found the painting striking. He thought it would be the perfect addition to a guesthouse he owns. He and the shop's co-owners, Buck Burns and Rick Johnson, brought the painting to the store in the back of a truck along with lamps and African art.\n\n\"The painting actually kind of got thrown in on top last,\" Van Auker said.\n\nHe leaned the painting against a coffee table in the store. The next day, the painting started attracting attention.\n\n\"I think that's a real de Kooning,\" one of the customers said.\n\nVan Auker assumed it was nothing more than a copy. But then two more visitors voiced similar opinions that it was a real de Kooning.\n\nVan Auker typed the words \"de Kooning\" into his internet browser. Among the results was a 2015 azcentral.com story about a de Kooning painting taken in a daring heist. The photo with the story looked exactly like the one in his store.\n\nVan Auker hid the painting in the shop's bathroom, the only interior room with a lock.\n\nHe nervously placed a series of calls: to the university art museum, to the FBI and to The Republic reporter who had written the 2015 story.\n\nThe museum's curator, Olivia Miller, was, of course, immediately interested. She asked Van Auker to email photos and measurements of the painting.\n\nWith each photo that she examined, Miller grew more excited.\n\nShe and other museum staffers drove to the antique shop the next day where, after seeing the painting in person, they arranged to bring it back to the university under police escort.\n\n\"After 31 years, stolen 'Woman-Ochre' returns,\" UA proclaimed.\n\n'Doing the right thing'\n\nFBI Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter, who works on the bureau's Art Theft Program, said when he learned \"Woman-Ochre\" had been found, his first reaction was shock.\n\nThe 30-year-plus case had gone cold. When art has been missing for decades, it's only natural to wonder whether the piece has been lost or destroyed, he said.\n\nValuable stolen art is extraordinarily hard to sell. It's common for high-value pieces to disappear for decades.\n\nBut it's gratifying when art is recovered thanks to the actions of \"good Samaritans,\" who call the FBI when they suspect they have come across stolen art, he said.\n\n\"I hate to be corny, but it really reinforces the notion that good people are out there and doing the right thing,\" Carpenter said.\n\nWhen architect and businessman Edward J. Gallagher Jr. donated \"Woman-Ochre\" to the museum in 1958, it was appraised at $6,000.\n\nThe painting was valued at $400,000 for insurance purposes when stolen.\n\nUA officials aren't releasing a current value on the advice of attorneys, and the museum couldn't and wouldn't sell the painting, under an agreement made with the donor.\n\nBut it's safe to say \"Woman-Ochre\" is worth more than $100 million. A similar de Kooning work, \"Woman III,\" sold for $137.5 million in 2006.\n\nWhen will 'Woman-Ochre' go on display?\n\nThefts of valuable paintings in broad daylight are rare, according to the FBI.\n\nMost museum thefts involve smaller, easier-to-fence items, such as historical documents or lower-value artifacts. It's usually museum insiders who are involved, stealing objects out of storage.\n\nThe de Kooning theft seemed to be a brazen crime that left few clues behind.\n\nIn their haste, the thieves damaged the painting.\n\nA sharp blade was used to cut the painting from its frame. The de Kooning was then ripped out, creating a tear in one corner. The thief rolled the canvas tightly and stuffed it under a coat, causing horizontal creases in the paint.\n\nUA officials are raising funds for repairs, but they don't yet know the extent or cost.\n\nThey have difficult decisions to make. Can the painting be reattached to its original frame? How much evidence of the theft should be left, if any?\n\nMuseum Curator Olivia Miller said there's a \"good likelihood\" repairs could start sometime in the next year so that, eventually, \"Woman-Ochre\" can be displayed at the museum again, more than 30 years after being taken.\n\nThe FBI isn't saying who took the de Kooning.\n\nBut it's hard to discount the clues, or coincidences, that point to a quirky couple from New Mexico with time to spare on a Thanksgiving vacation in 1985.\n\nRoseman, their nephew, doesn't want to believe the Alters are responsible. But with all the potential clues that have emerged in the last year, \"I can see that it's possible,\" he said.\n\nIf that's the case, the de Kooning theft turned out to be the perfect crime.\n\nFollow Anne Ryman on Twitter: @anneryman​​​​​​​", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/12/black-union-regiment-flag-notorious-big-pikachu-mini-pony-news-around-states/39572557/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nJune 12, 2019, 1:29 a.m. ET\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: University of Alabama officials say spots remain open for a youth forensic science camp on campus. Middle school and high school students are eligible for the camp run by the university’s Office of Archaeological Research in July. The camp offers experience dusting for fingerprints, examining blood spatter and other forensic science techniques. OAR Cultural Resources Analyst Lindsey Gordon tells the Tuscaloosa News the camp is ideal for students interested in forensic science, anthropology, sociology, human biology and criminal justice. The camp will have two sessions, July 8-12 for middle school students and July 22-26 for high school students. Each session costs $275. Students must register before June 30.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State officials are reconsidering whether special events like outdoor concerts are a responsible use of state park land. The Anchorage Daily News reports a concert in Chugach State Park was canceled following complaints about potential negative environmental impacts. The manager for folk band Blackwater Railroad Company says the proposed concert at Williwaw Lakes was intended to provide an intimate, outdoor experience encouraging conservation. He says the band expected attendance would be no more than 200 people due to the 12- to 16-mile round-trip hike to the event. More than a thousand people registered interest on social media. A park official says some outdoor enthusiasts feared the concert would damage the environment and backcountry experience at the site southeast of Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nFlorence: An outbreak of mumps among immigrants detained in federal facilities in Pinal County is fueling a statewide spike in cases. Mumps in Arizona this year has reached 42 confirmed cases – a 10-year annual high number less than halfway into 2019, state data shows. Mumps is a contagious viral disease that in most infected people will cause swelling of the salivary glands, causing puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw. The Arizona numbers likely will go up because the most recent data from the Pinal County Public Health Department indicates a higher case count than the state data reflects. As of Monday, nearly 300 immigration detainees at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Pinal County were under quarantine after being exposed to mumps, ICE officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: A dapper-dressed statue of gangster Al Capone has been repaired, repainted and returned to a bar after a failed attempt to steal the welcoming figure. The Sentinel-Record reports the redone statue was returned Saturday to a seat near a bench outside The Ohio Club in Hot Springs. Its website describes the business as the oldest bar in Arkansas, established in 1905, and Capone was a known visitor. Investigators say two men in March tried to snatch the statue but dropped and broke it. Both were charged with public intoxication and criminal mischief. Club owner Mike Pettey says repairs cost $3,500. Part of Capone’s white suit has been painted black. About $2,500 generated through T-shirt sales, celebrating Capone’s return, will be donated to the Garland County Historical Society.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Alamitos: The California National Guard has announced the appointment of the first woman to lead a U.S. Army infantry division. Brig. Gen. Laura Yeager will take command of the 40th Infantry Division on June 29 at Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos. Yeager currently commands Joint Task Force North, U.S. Northern Command at Fort Bliss, Texas. Yeager was commissioned in 1986 as a second lieutenant from the Reserve Officer Training Corps at California State University, Long Beach. She served as UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot, left active duty when her son was born and continued her military career in the California Army National Guard. Yeager deployed to Iraq in 2011 as deputy commander of the Cal Guard’s 40th Combat Aviation Brigade, then served as a battalion and brigade commander.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A long-running effort by the city to reduce train horn noise downtown is switching tracks. Officials have hired a lobbying firm to help find a federal legislative path for establishing a “quiet zone” along a section of the BNSF track near the Colorado State University campus. Trains rolling through a designated quiet zone don’t have to sound their horns before crossing intersections as required by Federal Railroad Administration regulations. The city’s move shows how frustrated officials are with trying to get the FRA to do what they want: waive a quiet zone rule that requires gates, lights and bells at every intersection a train crosses within a zone. City officials have argued there is not enough room for gates in all directions at every intersection.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection commissioner will soon be soliciting bids to develop 30% of the state’s entire energy load from offshore wind sources. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation into law that gives the commissioner 14 days to begin the request for proposals process. Lamont says it will mark the largest authorization by load – up to 2,000 megawatts – by any state in the region. Democratic and Republican proponents say they hope Connecticut will become a central hub for the offshore wind industry in New England. Lamont predicts the emerging industry can lead to hundreds of jobs and drive economic growth along the shoreline.\n\nDelaware\n\nLittle Creek: Environmental officials say the state’s once-dwindling horseshoe crab population could be recovering. Data from a federal commission that studies horseshoe crabs along the East Coast shows stability in numbers and even an increase in some regions, now that some states have regulated their harvests. The paper says the crab population suffered for decades from overfishing. It’s used for fertilizer, livestock food, bait and also medicine. The crab has unique properties in its blood that make it coveted for some medical products. Some scientists say an alternative to the crab’s blood could do more to boost the population. A synthetic alternative to crab blood has existed for 15 years but has yet to be widely accepted.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s financial leader says he won’t certify the city’s proposed $15.5 billion budget, saying it improperly diverts money that should go toward repaying city debts for a 2003 convention center. The Washington Post reports Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. DeWitt notified the City Council of his decision Monday. He previously warned of the rejection. The council moved ahead with it anyway. District law says DeWitt must certify the budget before it can be sent to the mayor or Congress for approval. DeWitt’s denial comes at a time when upcoming spending usually is finalized. The Post says this could lead to the loss of tens of millions of dollars meant for urgent public housing repairs. Chairman Phil Mendelson sought to fund the repairs by diverting money from other reserves.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City: It’s been eight months since Hurricane Michael ripped through the state’s Panhandle, but an effort to help victims is continuing. The News Herald reports local organizations have taken over for FEMA at the Community Recovery Center, offering medical and dental help and guiding victims of the October storm to the appropriate resources. A mobile medical truck is expected to stop at the center every Monday afternoon through the summer. Nurse practitioner Denise Miller says the offer a sliding scale base for people who don’t have insurance. Jo Shaffer, a site administrator for Doorways of Northwest Florida, says the group is in charge of data management at the center. If workers see someone needs something, they find a way to help. She says they connect with agencies like Catholic Charities.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A fundraising bash honoring the 90th birthday of philanthropist Bernie Marcus, one of Home Depot’s founders, has raised more than $117 million for Georgia charities. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Sunday’s star-studded gathering at the Atlanta Aquarium, which Marcus built, quickly raised $102 million in pledges. Arthur Blank, another founder of Home Depot and an owner of the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United of the MLS, contributed an additional $15 million. The event drew hundreds, including Gov. Brian Kemp and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. The paper says the funds will support charities including the Grady Health System’s Marcus Stroke & Neuroscience Center and the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta. Home Depot is Georgia’s largest public company based on revenue, according to the newspaper.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state budget passed by the Legislature includes funding for repairs at Waikiki Beach, officials say. Lawmakers approved about $13 million for improvements to the crumbling Royal Hawaiian seawall and other man-made structures at the state’s most visited beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “This is the largest appropriation for beach improvements on Oahu in recent memory. It allows us to move forward on several projects that have been discussed on and off for decades,” says Dolan Eversole of the University of Hawaii. The $13 million is sufficient to shore up the Royal Hawaiian seawall between the Waikiki Sheraton and Royal Hawaiian hotels and return a seawall to Kuhio Beach – structures officials say have been failing for years. Waikiki’s overhaul is scheduled to start by early fall.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A Treasure Valley woman is offering a healing practice called forest bathing to teach people how to stop and smell the roses – and maybe taste them, too. Forest bathing aims to ground people in nature using each of their senses. Sari Telpner is the only Association of Nature and Forest Therapy-certified guide in the Boise area. She began leading immersive nature experiences in the Idaho Botanical Garden this spring. There, she helps participants connect to the roses, irises, fir trees and, most importantly, themselves. “My practice is being in nature in a really intentional way,” Telpner told the Idaho Statesman. Sometimes that means feeling the grass beneath your feet or walking at “a pace that’s so slow it’s almost painful” while inspecting the scents, sights and sounds of the garden. Each session ends with a tea ceremony, brewed from plants like lilac and catmint Telpner gathers on-site.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A federal judge in the city says he’ll dismiss a lawsuit brought by a parks advocacy group that is trying to stop former President Barack Obama’s presidential center from being built in a lakefront park. U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey said there should be no delay in building the $500 million center after hearing arguments in court Tuesday. Protect Our Parks argued the city illegally transferred land for a park to The Obama Foundation, a private entity overseeing construction of the center. City lawyers accuse the parks group of exaggerating potential environmental problems, misreading the law and misrepresenting how the approval works. The center was supposed to open in 2021, but the lawsuit and a federal review have delayed construction at Jackson Park. An attorney for the parks organization says it plans to appeal.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A new school is two years from opening and still needs a leader, a charter and even a location. Yet families are already lining up to get their kids enrolled, says its founder, Jenn Watts. The reason for the fuss? Watts is planning the area’s first all-girls STEM school, in partnership with the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana. The yet-to-be-named school is slated to open in the fall of 2021, eventually serving girls in kindergarten through eighth grade. The idea, Watts says, is to get girls into STEM before they start hearing the message that science, technology, engineering and math aren’t for them. She’s familiar with how early that messaging starts and how it creates a gap that only widens as girls turn into women and enter the workforce, where STEM jobs continue to be dominated by men. The STEM school will be a first for the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: A prison program aims to alleviate a lack of affordable housing while teaching inmates construction skills they can use when they’re released. Newton Correction Facility inmates enrolled in the Iowa Prison Industries program are currently building an office and a classroom. But they will eventually build entire homes that can be moved to rural communities to address the decline in affordable housing. Inmates can also pursue apprenticeships for jobs in demand in the state. The acting warden of the low-and-medium security prison describes the program as a “win-win.” Those who qualify for affordable housing purchase can buy homes for about $125,000. The inmates gain marketable skills for when they leave prison. Families earning below $73,100 annually would qualify to purchase a home.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Local high school students are offering to digitally restore print photographs damaged when a tornado tore through Douglas County. The large storm last month damaged trees, struck power lines and left a trail of debris on the southeastern edge of Lawrence. County officials said six people were treated for injuries at a hospital. The Lawrence Journal-World reports that graphic design students at Free State and Lawrence high schools will start restoring photographs this fall. Lawrence teacher Jennifer Dixon-Perkins says personal items such as photos are irreplaceable and can provide a sense of normalcy after a catastrophe. Free State teacher Michelle Salmans says she tries to find ways for students to apply learning to real-world scenarios. She says students will take the assignments more seriously knowing they’re helping others.\n\nKentucky\n\nTompkinsville: The second annual Writers in the Park will be held this week at Old Mulkey Meetinghouse State Historic Site in Tompkinsville. A statement from Kentucky State Parks says more than a dozen authors will participate in the event Saturday, including Kimberly Bartley and Connie Hughes Goodman. Bartley is the author of “Until Death Parts,” “Life Goes On,” “Go Forth and Multiply” and the newly released “Pickin’ Up the Pieces.” Goodman has written several fiction pieces, a biography, and numerous documentaries including “Monroe County Poor House” and “Tell Me a Tale.” The event will include different writing genres and authors from around Kentucky and elsewhere. Participating authors will discuss, sell and sign books. There will also be a workshop offered for budding writers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: For celebrated Creole chef Leah Chase, the goodbye had all the ingredients of a typical New Orleans sendoff – warm reminiscences and mourning mixed with a Mardi Gras-style celebration of her life. Fellow chefs, musicians, family and friends were among hundreds who filed through a church Monday to pay last respects to Chase, who ran a family restaurant where civil rights strategies were discussed over gumbo and fried chicken in the 1950s and ’60s. She died June 1 at age 96. After a rosary and funeral Mass at St. Peter Claver Catholic Church featuring longtime local musician and singer Deacon John, a brass band, pallbearers, and members of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club slow-walked beside her hearse as it drove the few blocks to Dooky Chase’s restaurant – her last trip to the place where she earned renown as a chef, civil rights icon and patron of the arts.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers have passed a “Student Loan Bill of Rights” aiming to protect borrowers. The Senate unanimously enacted the legislation Monday. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has 10 days to act on the bill or let it go into law without her signature. Such legislation had failed in the last legislative session under a Republican administration. The bill creates a student loan ombudsman with responsibilities that include reviewing and possibly resolving complaints from borrowers. The ombudsman would also compile and analyze borrower data and help borrowers understand rights and responsibilities. Maine’s bill requires servicers who do business in Maine to obtain a license and undergo an investigation. The bill automatically licenses student loan servicers under contract with the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan is urging Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reconsider delaying the redesign of the $20 bill to feature abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman. The Republican governor made the request in a letter Tuesday. Tubman was born on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. She escaped from slavery to become a leading abolitionist and helped other slaves escape through the Underground Railroad. The Tubman redesign was initially scheduled to be released next year. Andrew Jackson, the nation’s seventh president, is now on the $20 bill. Mnuchin said the delay had been prompted by the decision to redesign the $10 bill and the $50 bill first for security reasons. He has said the decision on whether to keep Tubman on the redesigned $20 will be left to whoever is treasury secretary in 2026.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Legislature may renew a long-standing debate over whether the state should move to a graduated income tax. A proposal that would allow higher levels of income to be taxed at higher rates, as more than 30 states and the federal government do, could come up Wednesday when lawmakers hold a constitutional convention to discuss the so-called millionaire tax. A graduated income tax would go further than the millionaire tax, which calls for a 4% surtax only on individuals with annual incomes above $1 million. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday that he would oppose a graduated income tax, while House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Karen Spilka, both Democrats, did not immediately offer a position.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: Plans are in the works to enhance the Father Marquette National Memorial site in the Upper Peninsula. The state Department of Natural Resources says a draft plan for the site in Straits State Park in Mackinac County will be unveiled June 18 at St. Ignace Public Library. The Straits of Mackinac Heritage Center Collaborative is hosting an open house, and the public will have opportunities to comment online as well. The Meijer Foundation and several individual donors have contributed or pledged funding that will leverage time-limited matching funds from a $500,000 National Endowment for the Humanities Challenge Grant. Those involved in the project initially committed to raise $1.5 million. The site celebrates 17th-century French missionary Father Jacques Marquette, who was among the first Europeans to explore the Great Lakes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The state’s cash assistance program for low-income families will offer a $100 boost in monthly aid starting next year. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that state lawmakers approved the Minnesota Family Investment Program’s monthly grant increase in May. The extra funding will be available beginning February 2020. It’s the first increase to the program since it began 33 years ago. Minnesota officials estimate the change will help more than 30,000 families. Toshieka Washington and her children were homeless for two years, and she’s been relying on the program to get back on track. Washington says the $100-per-month increase will help her get basic necessities she can’t afford now, such as laundry detergent and more toilet paper. Washington says $100 doesn’t seem like much, but she feels like she won the lottery.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Officials are reminding charities that hire telemarketers to seek new donors that they now have to register under the state’s no-call law. Beginning July 1, charities that use paid telephone solicitors to prospect for new donors could be fined if they don’t register in Mississippi and allow people to opt out of telemarketing calls. Until now, all charities have been exempt from the rules. Under a law passed earlier this year, though, only charities that are contacting existing donors or making phone calls with volunteers are exempt. Senate Bill 2744 also allows businesses to register for the state’s no-call list. Until now, only individuals could register. The new law makes it illegal to cause a fake number to display on caller identification, a practice known as spoofing.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A new report shows that black drivers in the state are 91% more likely than white motorists to be pulled over by police. Data released by the attorney general shows disparities are sometimes even greater when only comparing stops of local residents. The 2018 report comes nearly five years after Ferguson protesters drew national attention to long-standing concerns about police treatment of black communities. Criminologist Richard Rosenfeld cautioned that the latest data is based on population data from the 2010 census but says changes in racial demographics alone don’t explain the disparity increase. Missouri Sheriffs’ Association Executive Director Kevin Merritt says law enforcement officials have no tolerance for racial bias. But he says law enforcement want to collect more information, including whether officers knew the race of the driver before stopping them.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A man whose father signed up for cryogenic preservation after death is suing to obtain the older man’s remains. Laurence Pilgeram paid Scottsdale, Arizona-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation $120,000 to preserve his remains in a frozen state indefinitely. Pilgeram hoped if he were frozen, future technology might someday enable him to be restored to life. He died in 2015. Now, Kurt Pilgeram, of Dutton, Montana, claims in a lawsuit that Alcor severed his father’s head for freezing and sent him the cremated remains of the rest of the body. The son claims his father wanted his entire body preserved. Pilgeram seeks over $1 million in damages and the return of his father’s head. Alcor says it has honored its agreement with Laurence Pilgeram.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Game and Parks Commission has scheduled special events at four state parks and recreation areas for Father’s Day this Sunday. The commission says there will be a fishing clinic at the Danish Alps State Recreation Area near Hubbard in northeast Nebraska. The event begins at 10 a.m. Bait and equipment will be provided. Barbecued ribs will be served from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. during a buffet at Fort Robinson State Park, west of Crawford in northwest Nebraska. There will be a special Father’s Day Buffet from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Platte River State Park near Louisville in eastern Nebraska. A fish fry that includes a Dutch oven cobbler dessert is scheduled to run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Ponca State Park, north of Ponca in northeast Nebraska. Park entry permits are required for vehicles. More information is available online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities in the city say they’re worried about the risk of explosion in neighborhoods where gasoline thieves are storing flammable fuel. Lt. Shane Womack told reporters the concern is that flammable vapor during hot summer weather could ignite with catastrophic effect. Police are distributing a public service announcement after Womack says 25 people were arrested recently for using fake or stolen credit cards to buy large amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel with plans to resell it. He says the scheme seems to be organized, and suspects have used vans or pickup trucks modified with oversize fuel tanks to get gasoline to storage tanks in residential areas. Deputy Clark County Fire Chief Jon Wiercinski says investigators found almost no cases in which the flammable fuel was stored safely.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has started a new center focused on the science of sound. The university currently focuses on underwater acoustics. The new Center for Acoustics Research and Education will initially focus on environmental acoustics, which takes into account sound movement through the air, on land and underwater. It will support expansion into fields like music, speech and medicine. Anthony Lyons, the center’s associate director for research, says he’s already heard from industry and government partners interested in opportunities for professional development and collaboration.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed a law requiring most of the state’s hotels to provide their workers with wearable panic buttons they can press to quickly summon help in an emergency. The Democratic governor signed the bill Tuesday. He and several nationwide unions say New Jersey is the first state to mandate the devices, although at least two others are considering similar measures. The law takes effect in January and applies to hotels with 100 or more rooms. That includes all nine Atlantic City casinos. Iris Sanchez, a room cleaner at Caesars, says she’s relieved to know she’ll be going home safely each night after working. In 2018, a room cleaner at Bally’s casino was pushed into a room by a man who then sexually assaulted her.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: Once a staple in the Four Corners region that connected Navajo weavers and artists to buyers, trading posts are facing challenges to their survival – increased competition from online retailers and large regional grocery store chains, as well as working to navigate changing demands. The Shiprock Trading Post in Farmington now focuses exclusively on Navajo rugs, jewelry, pottery and other works of art. It used to provide all sorts of goods to Navajo customers. Farmington Museum at Gateway Park director Bart Wilsey says trading posts that have survived into the 21st century have become art galleries that deal almost exclusively in Native art or become convenience stores. Wilsey says they also can become wholesalers for Navajo rugs and art in order to remain healthy.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A street in the city has been named for rapper Notorious B.I.G. Community members and elected officials gathered in a downpour Monday at the intersection of St. James Place and Fulton Street. Rapper Lil’ Kim – embracing the event’s themes of social justice and making a difference – exclaimed: “We did it, Brooklyn!” B.I.G., who was born Christopher Wallace, was shot to death in Los Angeles in 1997. He detailed street life in Brooklyn in songs and on albums that dominated the pop charts. Voletta Wallace recalled telling a friend amid her heartbreak: “My son was well loved.” But she said the street naming evoked “happy tears.” The new Christopher “Notorious B.I.G” Wallace Way is in Brooklyn’s Clinton Hill area.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House is reconstituting an oversight committee that will keep monitoring challenges state government has had in distributing federal long-term housing grants to hurricane victims in eastern North Carolina. House Speaker Tim Moore announced Tuesday that the House Select Committee on Disaster Relief has been authorized to meet again. The panel met in 2018 and scrutinized why the state was slow giving out $237 million in federal community development grant funds received after Hurricane Matthew in 2016 for housing repairs. A report by the legislature’s government watchdog agency last month quantifying that slowness again led House Republicans from eastern North Carolina to seek the committee’s reauthorization. The agency issued a follow-up report Monday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s congressional delegation is calling on President Donald Trump’s administration to address North Dakota’s year-old request for $38 million to cover the cost of policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The Bismarck Tribune reports that U.S. Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong sent a letter Thursday urging Attorney General William Barr and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to settle the state’s claim. North Dakota’s attorney general filed a claim against the Army Corps of Engineers last year, accusing the agency of letting protesters illegally camp on federal land in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017. It also argued the Corps didn’t maintain law and order.\n\nOhio\n\nReynoldsburg: State officials plan to begin aerial treatments aimed at disrupting gypsy moth mating on more than 61,000 acres in 12 counties across the state. The gypsy moth is a non-native, invasive species that feeds on the leaves of more than 300 different trees and shrubs and can permanently damage or kill them. The Ohio Department of Agriculture release says the organic product used in the treatments set to begin June 12 slows the spread of the moths by confusing the males as they search for a female mate. It doesn’t kill the moths. Airplanes will apply the treatment from approximately 100 feet above treetops and buildings. Treatments are scheduled for parts of Allen, Franklin, Guernsey, Hancock, Hocking, Jackson, Licking, Morgan, Muskingum, Noble, Perry and Wyandot counties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A judge is declining to approve the state’s proposed $85 million settlement with an opioid maker until he’s assured it complies with a new law targeting such deals. The attorney general’s office says Cleveland County Judge Thad Balkman on Monday ordered attorneys for both the state and Israeli-owned Teva Pharmaceuticals to file additional paperwork before he approves the settlement. Attorney General spokesman Alex Gerszewski says the judge wants both sides to address how distribution of the money conforms to the new law. Concerned about how the state’s $270 million settlement with Purdue Pharmaceuticals was structured, the Republican-led Legislature passed a law directing any settlement funds directly into the state treasury.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Four of the state’s public universities will defend substantial tuition increases this week in front of the Higher Education Coordinating Commission amid protests from frustrated students. The University of Oregon is proposing a 9.7% increase, the Oregon Institute of Technology seeks a 9% increase, Portland State University wants an 11% increase, and Southern Oregon University is looking at a 13.5% jump, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The commission must OK tuition hikes of more than 5%, and Portland State students have vowed to express their anger at a tuition hike approved by the school’s board at the commission meeting Thursday. Oregon State, as well as Eastern and Western Oregon universities, approved increases that are less than 5%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDenver: A hand-painted flag carried into battle by a black Union regiment during the Civil War is going up for auction. Morphy Auctions will sell off the piece of history Thursday. Pre-bidding is underway online. It’s one of 11 such flags painted by African American artist David Bustill Bowser, the son of a fugitive slave. It’s the only known surviving flag. The auction house says seven others are known only from photographs. They were sent to the military museum at West Point in 1906 but were thrown out in the 1940s. The flag up for auction depicts a black soldier waving goodbye to Columbia, the female personification of America, beneath a banner reading, “We Will Prove Ourselves Men.” The 127th Regimental banner is expected to fetch about $250,000.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Environmental officials are asking for the public’s help in tracking the state’s wild turkey population. The Department of Environmental Management is providing a form online that can be submitted when anyone sees a wild turkey, either an adult hen or a young turkey, known as poults. DEM believes the state’s wild turkey population is growing, based on the number of young turkeys reaching maturity and an increase in harvests reported during the spring hunting season that ended last month. The 2019 spring harvest was 270 birds, an increase of 42% from the 2018 season. DEM says the increase of 80 birds is likely due to an increase in the spring season bag limit from one to two birds. DEM receives hundreds of brood reports annually that assist biologists.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFountain Inn: The owner of a miniature pony named Pikachu believes the animal was stolen from her South Carolina home. Hidden Pasture Farm owner Kate Nichols tells news outlets that the miniature palomino filly disappeared overnight last week. Nichols tells WAPT she has searched for the pony extensively, and there are also no signs that it was taken by a predator. Instead, Nichols thinks someone in the area is to blame. The station reports Pikachu was well-known in the community for making appearances at children’s parties dressed as a unicorn. Pikachu is 2 months old and weighs 60 pounds. Nichols posted on Facebook that she believes Pikachu is in danger and is offering a $1,000 reward for its return. She also wrote that “someone knows where she is.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A man has scrapped plans to open a museum honoring recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. John L. Johnson of Rapid City had planned to open the museum Aug. 1 at the Rushmore Mall. But he told the Rapid City Journal last month that he has abandoned that plan after receiving threats. Instead, he says he plans to open an art gallery for Native American artists on that date in the same space planned for the museum. Johnson sparked controversy in an interview with the newspaper when he referred to efforts to rescind medals given to U.S. cavalry soldiers for the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre. Johnson said many of those soldiers who went on to receive the medal acted heroically.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Jack White-led rockers The Raconteurs, multiple Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile and rap legends Wu-Tang Clan lead the lineup for the 2019 Mempho Music Festival. The third edition of the annual concert fest will take place Oct. 19-20 at Shelby Farms Park. The festival made its official lineup announcement Monday during a press event at the Sam Phillips Recording Studio. Organizers confirmed most of the nearly 20 acts who will appear at the two-day weekend fest, including Americana favorite Margo Price, West Tennessee native and roots songstress Valerie June, Memphis rap great DJ Paul, New Orleans rockers the Revivalists, and California pop combo lovelytheband.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A member of the iconic rap group the Geto Boys is hoping to trade beats and rhymes for politics. Scarface, whose real name is Brad Jordan, announced over the weekend that he plans to run for a Houston City Council seat. The Office of the City Secretary confirmed Monday that Jordan had filed paperwork naming his campaign treasurer. The 48-year-old Jordan first made his announcement on Instagram on Saturday, saying, “I’m offering myself for service as the next Houston City Councilmember for District D.” Jordan, who grew up in Houston, gained fame in the late 1980s with the Geto Boys before launching a successful solo career. The announcement comes after another Geto Boys member, Bushwick Bill, died Sunday of pancreatic cancer.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: A Utah mom of two intersex children born two decades apart is rejecting the secrecy that often surrounds people born with both male and female traits. After Amie Schofield’s eldest child was injured in a violent attack, she and her husband became determined to speak out for 5-year-old Victory, who was born with ambiguous genitalia. Doctors have long performed surgery on intersex kids to make their bodies more like typical boys or girls, but families like the Schofields are refusing surgery and pushing for intersex kids to be accepted as they are born. Schofield says she’s like any other parent; she doesn’t want her daughter to think there’s anything wrong with her because she’s different.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Proponents of a bill that would have imposed a 24-hour waiting period to buy handguns say a veto Monday by the Republican governor was a political move that will cost the lives of people contemplating suicide and victims of domestic violence. Gov. Phil Scott’s veto also drew condemnation from Democratic leaders of the Vermont House and Senate, which both passed legislation last month that contained the waiting period and a change to an unintended consequence of separate gun legislation signed into law by the governor last year. While gun rights activists said they appreciate Scott’s veto, they are still upset by a series of gun control measures signed by the governor last year. Proponents say the legislation would have helped save lives of people considering taking their own lives because they won’t be able to get firearms as quickly. It was also hoped it would prevent homicides.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s tourism industry generated $26 billion in visitor spending across all communities in 2018, a 4.4% increase over 2017. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday that the tourism industry also provided $1.8 billion in state and local revenue in 2018. That’s an increase of 2.9% compared to the previous year. The slogan “Virginia is for Lovers” was developed in 1969 by Richmond-based advertising firm Martin & Woltz, now the Martin Agency. It is the longest-running state tourism slogan in the country. Destinations around the state are participating in the commemoration of “50 Years of LOVE” and celebrating the impact tourism has on Virginia’s economy and communities. The travel industry is the fifth-largest employer in Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a long-delayed plan to redevelop unused Army land next to Discovery Park into about 240 affordable homes and open spaces. The Seattle Times reports the $90 million plan was updated by Mayor Jenny Durkan in February and approved Monday. It calls for the 34-acre Fort Lawton property in the Magnolia neighborhood to be replaced by 85 studio apartments for formerly homeless seniors, 100 rentals for low-income individuals and families, and up to 52 affordable homes for sale. The city would also convert land into two athletic fields, make 13 grassy acres available for picnicking and incorporate several more wooded acres into Discovery Park. Nonprofits including the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, Catholic Community Services and Habitat for Humanity would build the housing using city, state and federal funding.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: New River Gorge National River has several projects planned this summer to improve the area for visitors. The projects include replacing the Sandstone Falls boardwalk and the boardwalk at Brooks Falls, replacing roofs at the Canyon Rim Visitor Center and the Thurmond Depot Visitor Center, upgrading the Army Camp Campground, and adding two new parking areas. New River Gorge Superintendent Lizzie Watts told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that work on the Sandstone Falls boardwalk is expected to last all summer, but the park will try to keep it open on weekends. Goats will also return to the park this summer to remove kudzu and other brush and weeds from the Thurmond area.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The popular China Lights festival will return to Boerner Botanical Gardens from Sept.13 through Oct.20, according to a press release from County Executive Chris Abele. This will be the fourth year in Milwaukee for the colorful China Lights at the gardens. The festival drew more than 100,000 visitors each of the past three years. This year’s event promises new cultural gems re-created as handmade lantern displays ranging from 3 feet to three stories tall. The 2019 China Lights festival also will include an expanded interactive exhibit area, two stages for Asian folk-culture performances, a marketplace, two dining areas, and vendors offering a variety of Asian and Western menu options. More information is available online.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Overcrowding is a concern among members of the task force working on a plan to build $300 million worth of new student dormitories at the University of Wyoming. The Laramie Boomerang reports that UW Vice President for Student Affairs Sean Blackburn says large dorms only make the transition to college more difficult for freshmen coming from rural areas of the state. He noted that White Hall has a comparable population to the town of Big Piney. Blackburn is pushing for an approach with the new dorms that will create a “sense of place,” something he says Wyoming students have a particular affinity for. Blackburn is asking for freshmen to be housed in “small-scale communities of 20 to 30 aggregated into a larger building.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/12"}]}

Among the ceremony's accolades are the coveted \"big four\" categories – album of the year, song of the year, record of the year and best new artist.\n\nThe best new artist award made its first appearance at the 2nd annual Grammy Awards. From then on, it has catapulted hundreds of artists further into the mainstream.\n\nDespite its name, artists nominated for the award don't necessarily have to be fresh to the music scene. A \"new artist\" is defined as one who establishes their public identity as a performer during the eligibility period, according to the Recording Academy. In short, a recording artist or group with a discography that spans years could still be nominated for best new artist if they've only recently become popular.\n\nThere have been two years the best new artist award was not given: 1967 and 1990, when Milli Vanilli was originally awarded, but was later revoked when it was discovered the duo didn't actually sing on their album.\n\nLet's take a look at every best new artist Grammy Award winner through the years, and see who made the cut for nominations ahead of this year's 67th annual ceremony on Feb. 2.\n\nNeed a news break?

The boundaries that existed between genres have been largely blurred as the internet makes it easy for consumers to explore sounds.\n\nK-pop stars are collaborating with rappers, country music is more pop than ever (or is pop more country?), and bands are getting creatively niche in their descriptors. The result has been a cheapening of words like \"genre-bending\" or \"crossover star.\"\n\nNo rule is without an exception, though, and Khruangbin is one with a capital E. The Texas-based trio of guitarist Mark Speer, drummer Donald \"DJ\" Johnson and bassist Laura Lee Ochoa prove that you can love what you're listening to − even if you're not quite sure what it is. Recording Academy voters agreed, nominating the group for best new artist at the upcoming Grammy Awards.\n\nThe name − pronounced KRUNG-bin− is Thai for airplane. Appropriately, the group's music often lifts you to a somewhat liminal state, swaying between altitudes and time zones.\n\nThat's on purpose, Ochoa, who performs under the name \"Leezy\" tells me. While advanced music studios have been designed to expertly filter out background noise, that creates the feeling that the music \"doesn’t sound like it lives anywhere,” she says.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nTo counteract that effect, Khruangbin records most of their music in a barn that rattles slightly and catches the sounds of nearby wildlife.\n\n“I think it just sort of helps that daydream,\" she says. \"Whether or not the listener actually can tell what it is or is put in the same place that we were, I think it sort of subconsciously or not allows you to daydream to a place.”\n\nThe Grammy nomination came as a surprise for Ochoa, who says she generally classified the awards as more of a pop-sphere event. The category − best new artist − was also a shock. The group's inaugural album turned 10 this year. After reading the qualifications though, which describe \"new\" as also referring to a fresh \"breakthrough into the public consciousness,\" Ochoa said it was “emotional and inspiring\" to feel the group was making an impact.\n\nKhruangbin's newest album, \"A LA SALA,\" is a dreamy 12-track amble that fuses sometimes ominous bass intros with warmer, groovy melodies to create a sun-soaked sound.\n\nDevoid of lyrics (mostly), the pressure to show-not-tell mounts.\n\nOchoa says the group always starts by laying the bass, guitar, and drum track − only adding words if it feels like the song is missing something.\n\n“We want to do what the song wants,\" she says, likening it to decorating a bedroom. When you walk into the room, you know which way the bed should face, she jokes, the room tells you. Songs are no different.\n\n“As the world has advanced the way that it has, it sometimes limits our ability to have imagination,\" Ochoa says. \"Not telling you everything is entrusting the listener to know the story already and to also know that the story can be different for everyone and that somebody’s own story is so much more powerful than the story I can tell you to have.”\n\nIt's that same trust in their audience that led Khruangbin to opt for a more quiet sound with \"A LA SALA.\" Their previous album, \"Mordechai,\" represented a \"much more upbeat and lively expression\" of the band, Ochoa explains. Made partly to appease larger festival crowds, the project leaned into more up-tempo vocal-heavy tracks where \"A LA SALA\" features a more subdued score.\n\nThe title of the album, which means \"to the room\" in Spanish, is only one component of foreign-language influence. Speer, who Ochoa describes as the mastermind behind the group's use of varied sounds and international influences, often brings in mixes that aren't in English.\n\n“He tends to listen to music from far-flung corners of the Earth,\" she says. \"He’s constantly digging to find unheard-of music.”\n\nPerhaps predisposed to hear music as a collection of sounds rather than a lyric-based narrative, Ochoa says incorporating music from foreign languages can be liberating for the listener.\n\n“Part of the power in music in other languages is that you don’t necessarily understand what they’re saying and so it becomes like instrumental music in this way,\" she explains. \"Except that a human voice resonates with people sometimes more so than an instrument because everyone has one. And so when you listen to music in another language you can connect to it because it’s human. But you still get to make up your own story.”\n\nThat sample-heavy, international sound is part of what makes any genre label slip right off Khruangin's music.\n\nWith just over 6.5 million monthly listeners, the trio is listed on Spotify as \"Indie rock\" and Apple Music as \"alternative.\"\n\nFor now, Ochoa doesn't much mind being either genre-bound or genre-bending. “Humans naturally need to find classifications for things because otherwise how would you describe them?” she says, adding as an artist (or three artists, in this case) \"you don’t want to put yourself in a box.”\n\nJoking about \"Music Box,\" a recent Yacht Rock documentary in which the likes of Steely Dan and Toto shrugged off the label as not really describing their music, Ochoa said, \"Maybe in year’s time somebody will finally come up with a genre that describes us and we can say − politely −no.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/02/02/grammys-2025-live-updates/77976699007/", "title": "Grammy Awards live: Beyoncé (finally) wins album of the year", "text": "Feb. 2, 2025 Updated Feb. 3, 2025, 5:41 p.m. ET\n\nThe Grammys have come and gone – and music lovers have a lot of mixed feelings about music's biggest night.\n\nBeyoncé fans are probably feeling awesome right now. The singer took home three trophies, including one, finally, for album of the year. It was a rough night for Swifties, however, as Taylor Swift lost every category she competed in. So did Billie Eilish.\n\nBut that’s not all. Kendrick Lamar swept, Sabrina Carpenter picked up two wins and Chappell Roan came out on top in arguably the most competitive best new artist race in recent years. Plus there was bold fashion, high-energy performances and plenty of touching tributes to Los Angeles, which hosted the ceremony after being ravaged by wildfires in one of our country's worst natural disasters.\n\nThere was a lot packed into one awards show, but we’ve got you covered. Here are all the highlights from the 67th annual Grammys.\n\nBeyoncé finally wins album of the year; Taylor Swift leaves empty-handed\n\nAt long last: Beyoncé has won album of the year.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nAfter about (checks notes) a gazillion nominations and a long, long career, Beyoncé finally won album of the year, for the country-tinged “Cowboy Carter.” Her daughter Blue Ivy led her by the hand to the stage in a sweet moment.\n\nDuring her acceptance speech, Beyoncé took a moment to acknowledge and praise Los Angeles firefighters, some of whom announced the contenders and her win. She said she feels “very full and very honored” and that “it’s been very many years” leading up to her win. No kidding.\n\nSwift, on the other hand, ended the night without a single trophy in a sharp contrast to last year, when she picked up her fourth album of the year award. Still, she didn’t seem to care; she and Jay-Z clinked their glasses in cheers after Beyoncé’s win. Beyhive members around the world are surely raising their glasses in celebration too.\n\nWhat is Drake's reaction to Kendrick Lamar's sweep?\n\nKendrick Lamar swept his categories – record and song of the year − and honestly, what I wish I could have seen more than his acceptance speeches was Drake’s reaction. Lamar dropped the track “Not Like Us” amid a heated public feud with Drake that saw them both trade scathing barbs back-and-forth in songs, including serious allegations of abuse. \"Not Like Us\" is a diss track aimed at Drake, and Drake has sued Lamar's record label over it. Clearly the Recording Academy is team Lamar.\n\nDespite the track’s harsh origin, Lamar gave acceptance speeches that were much more mild. His first paid tribute to his home city of Los Angeles and offered encouragement to those wanting to rebuild the city after the fires. That message might be one of the only things he and Drake could both agree on.\n\nGrammy winners full list: Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Chappell Roan take top awards\n\nTaylor Swift loses again as Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars win best pop duo/group performance\n\nIs Swift – dare we say – going to be the big loser of the night? After sweeping the Grammys last year, she lost two of her categories. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars won best pop duo/group performance for their song “Die with a Smile,” beating Swift and Gracie Abrams, who were nominated for their song “Us.” Stay strong, Swifties – there’s still album of the year, record of the year and song of the year to go.\n\nGaga continued the trend of giving acceptance speeches with political undertones. “I just want to say tonight that trans people are not invisible,” she said. “The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love. Thank you.”\n\nShakira shouts out 'immigrant brothers and sisters'\n\nAfter winning best Latin pop album for \"Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\" Shakira gave a shout-out to fellow immigrants, dedicating her trophy to them. Her speech took on deeper resonance amid ICE raids across the country.\n\n“I want to dedicate this award to all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country,” she said. “You are loved, you are worth it and I will always fight with you.”\n\nShe added: “To all of those women who work really hard every day to provide for their families, you are the true she-wolves.”\n\nThe Weeknd ends Grammys boycott. OK?\n\nThroughout the entire show, host Trevor Noah had been hyping up something big. Now, it’s finally here. What could it be? Will Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus duet their hit from “Cowboy Carter”? Will a legend like Dolly Parton return to sing Beyoncé’s version of “Jolene” with her? Is Swift finally going to announce “Reputation (Taylor’s Version)”? Sorry, Beyhive and Swifties – none of those things are happening.\n\nInstead, the big announcement was… the return of The Weeknd to the Grammys! That’s right, he was boycotting the ceremony − remember? Because I didn’t.\n\nRecording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. took the stage to announce updates to the organization’s voting body, saying its members are now younger and more diverse. Because of that, The Weeknd has decided to end his Grammys boycott. And that’s not all! He’s performing too.\n\nListen, if the Recording Academy wants to publicly pat itself on the back, they have every right to do that – it’s their show after all. But can they at least not lead viewers on by making us think a music legend was actually taking the stage? The Weeknd's performance was fine, but it was certainly not worth all that hype.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that The Weeknd’s big Grammys return is coming just as he has an album and tour to promote. How big of him. You can practically feel the forgiveness, healing and reconciliation through the television screen.\n\nChappell Roan wins best new artist, advocates for healthcare\n\nPink Pony Club, rise! Chappell Roan is this year’s Grammys best new artist.\n\nVictoria Monét, last year’s winner, announced the category, arguably the most competitive of this year’s ceremony. “That’s a tough category,” she remarked after reading out the stacked nominees list, which included Carpenter, Shaboozey, Doechii, Teddy Swims, Benson Boone and RAYE. You can say that again, Monét.\n\n'Do you got us?' Chappell Roan urges music labels to support developing artists at Grammys\n\nRoan, always one to speak up about things she believes in (for better or worse), took the opportunity to press record labels to provide a “livable wage” as well as adequate healthcare to their up-and-coming artists. It’s a struggle she said she knows personally: Roan, who’s been dropped by a label before, said she knows what it’s like to not have healthcare.\n\n“Labels, we got you, but do you got us?” she asked.\n\nTaylor Swift announces Beyoncé’s big country win\n\nIf any artist knows about bending and breaking genres, it’s Swift, who started off in country and eventually became an all-around pop music sensation.\n\nAt the Grammys, she announced the winner for best country album: Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter”!\n\nBeyoncé looked shocked at the announcement, with her eyes wide as she stood. “Wow, I really was not expecting this,” she said from the stage. “I think sometimes 'genre' is a code word to keep us in our place as artists, and I just want to encourage people to do what they’re passionate about and to stay consistent.”\n\nIt was a sweet moment to watch the two biggest stars in music onstage together and, dare we say, \"holding space\" for each other. Here’s to more grace and genre-breaking for everyone in 2025.\n\nSabrina Carpenter beats Taylor Swift for best pop vocal album\n\nIs the era of Swift sweeping every Grammys category officially over? Has the coven of the Recording Academy declared a new supreme?\n\nCarpenter took home the trophy for best pop vocal album, beating industry veterans Ariana Grande, newcomer Roan and, arguably the biggest artist in the world right now, Ms. Swift, whom Carpenter opened for on the record-breaking Eras tour.\n\nSwift seemed overjoyed at Carpenter’s win, jumping up from her seat and cheering like a proud mom. And speaking of moms, even though Carpenter was visibly flustered, she still remembered to shout hers out in her acceptance speech: “I want to thank my mom for driving me to every voice lesson.\n\nDoechii becomes third woman to win best rap album\n\nWe’re only one category in, and history has already been made at this year's Grammys.\n\nDoechii became the third woman ever to win best rap album, taking home the trophy for her mixtape “Alligator Bites Never Heal.” She gave an emotional speech that also shouted out Lauryn Hill and Cardi B, the two women winners who came before her. Carbi B announced the category.\n\nDoechii ended her speech with a direct message to Black women watching: “You can do it. Anything is possible. … Don’t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you.” Gayle King clearly resonated, appearing to shout \"preach\" from her seat in the audience.\n\nGrammys kick off with touching LA tribute after wildfire disaster\n\nThe Grammys had a somber start and for good reason – as host Noah noted, the awards show comes on the heels of major wildfires that ravaged Los Angles, one of the worst natural disasters in the country’s history. Dawes, a band that Noah says lost their childhood home and instruments in the fires, performed Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.,” with revised lyrics referencing the fires. The star-studded backing band included John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Swift seemed to vibe with it, bobbing her head from her seat in the background. It was a more subdued intro than most Grammys watchers are probably used to, but it was necessary. The wildfires were an elephant in the room that needed addressing, lest the awards show come off tone deaf, which is the last thing fans want tonight. Before the first break, the show also gave some ad time to a local LA business, Orla Floral Studio. They also encouraged people watching from home to donate to fire relief.\n\nKanye West's wife Bianca Censori shocks on red carpet with see-through clothing\n\nAh, the Grammys. Music’s biggest night. The epitome of class, grace, elegance and – oh my, what is Kanye West’s wife doing?\n\nThat was basically our reaction when West – er, excuse me, “Ye,” – walked onto the Grammys red carpet with his wife Bianca Censori. As if their mere presence wasn’t enough of a shock, in videos circulating on social media, Censori dropped her black coat in front of photographers to pose in… literally nothing. Yep, she was in some kind of tight, see-through ensemble that basically exposed, well, everything. I can only imagine the irate conversations happening among Recording Academy producers right now.\n\nIf the shocking moment bodes anything for the main show tonight, we better buckle up for whatever the rest of the evening might hold.\n\nGrammys 2025 red carpet live updates: Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Ye and more\n\nThe Beatles are still winning Grammys in 2025\n\nThe Beatles can't stop and won't be stopped. The 2023 \"new\" song from one of the most popular bands of all time, \"Now and Then,\" managed a win for best rock performance. The late John Lennon's son Sean happened to be in the crowd (he won for another category), and was beyond excited to accept for his dad's band. \"Play The Beatles for your kids,\" he implored the audience. He doesn't have much to worry about: kids love the Beatles, \"yeah yeah yeah.\" A few categories later the Beatles' contemporaries, The Rolling Stones, won best rock album for \"Hackney Diamonds.\" A good day for classic rock.\n\nJimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy for audiobook narration\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter, who died December 29, won a Grammy award for his audiobook \"Last Sundays In Plains: A Centennial Celebration.\" His grandson Jason accepted the award: \"I believe it means so much at this moment in our country and in our history,\" he said, thanking the world for the outpouring of support his family has received since the former president died at age 100. It's Carter's fourth Grammy win.\n\nKendrick Lamar and 'Not Like Us' win three Grammys a week before Super Bowl halftime performance\n\nIs Drake following along at home? Because what may be the next entry in the long-running feud between rappers Drake and Lamar occurred at the Grammys' early awards when Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" won best rap performance, best rap song and best music video. The two artists have traded allegations and insults in diss tracks, part of a very public escalation in hostility between two high-profile hip hop artists that culminated with Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" becoming a hit last May and a federal lawsuit about the song filed this month by Drake. The song includes Lamar calling Drake a \"certified pedophile\" and the accompanying artwork for the track contained an aerial view of Drake's mansion outside of Toronto, with red sex offender symbols placed on the home. More escalation could follow at Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 when Lamar performs, presumably including \"Not Like Us\" on his set list, in front of tens of millions watching the halftime performance.\n\nBeyoncé and 'Cowboy Carter' nab a country Grammy\n\nThat’s Grammy-award winning country artist Beyoncé to you! The mega superstar won her first Grammy of the night for best country duo/group performance with Cyrus for their duet \"II MOST WANTED.\" But Bey lost out on best country solo performance to Chris Stapleton and best country song to Kacey Musgraves. Musgraves was the rare A-lister to show up to the pre-show to accept her trophy in person. “There’s so much darkness in the world right now, and it feels so good to be able to fight that darkness through song,\" she said.\n\nCharli XCX gets first ever Grammy by going 'BRAT'\n\n'BRAT' summer may be over, but that doesn't mean Charli XCX is slowing down. The electronica artist and lime-green fashion influencer won her first Grammy for best pop dance recording for her song \"Von Dutch,\" and then won her second Grammy soon after for best dance/electronic music album for her viral 2025 album 'BRAT.'

Marjorie Taylor Greene puts accountability on DOJ\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she expects a near-unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files, but she said the fight won’t be over.\n\nShe referenced language in the bill that would allow the Department of Justice to withhold documents that are relevant to an ongoing investigation.\n\n“The real test will be will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in an investigation,” Greene said.\n\nShe also questioned whether a list of Epstein's accomplices will come out, mentioning a list that survivors have created and are holding privately “because of their fear in their heart.”\n\n“Will that list of names come out?” she asked. “That’s the real test.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nRep. Ro Khanna calls for shunning of Epstein’s associates\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, the Democrat from California who is co-sponsoring the bill to force the release of the Epstein files, said people associated with Epstein should not be honored in our society.\n\n“There should be no buildings named after these people in the Epstein class,” Khanna said at a news conference Tuesday morning outside the Capitol building. “There should be no scholarships named after them.\n\n“Many of the survivors will tell you these people still are celebrated in our society,” he added. “That’s disgusting. There needs to be accountability.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nLarry Summers stepping back from public commitments over Epstein ties\n\nFormer U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard University President Larry Summers said Monday that he would be stepping back from public commitments after recently released emails showed that he regularly corresponded with Epstein.\n\nA trove of more than 20,000 pages of emails released by the House Oversight Committee on Nov. 12 revealed that Summers sought relationship advice in 2019 from the disgraced financier.\n\n“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” the Harvard Crimson quoted Summers as saying in a statement Monday. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein.”\n\nSummers, who served as Treasury secretary to former President Bill Clinton, had been a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. A spokesman for the liberal policy group said in a statement that Summers' was ending his CAP fellowship.\n\nHe also serves as director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard's Kennedy School, where he will continue teaching.\n\n— Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump when asked about Epstein: 'Quiet, piggy'\n\nTrump told a reporter \"quiet, piggy\" while speaking with members of the media on Air Force One on Friday about the Epstein files.\n\nIn video footage of a gaggle with the press on November 14 released by the White House, Trump says, \"Quiet, quiet piggy,\" as a female reporter, standing off camera, begins to ask if there was anything \"incriminating\" in Epstein's emails.

U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana was the sole no vote.\n\nIowa's U.S. Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra all voted Nov. 18 in favor of the bill, even though none of them signed the discharge petition that forced the House to vote on the measure.\n\nSens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst voted for the legislation hours later.\n\nThe legislation would require the U.S. Department of Justice to release unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials related to the department's investigation and prosecution of Epstein.\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers persuaded a majority of the House to sign the discharge petition, allowing members to bypass leadership and bring the issue to a vote.\n\nAfter opposing the measure, President Donald Trump reversed course Nov. 16 and urged House Republicans to vote for the legislation, saying on Truth Social, \"we have nothing to hide.\"\n\nThe bill passed the U.S. Senate unanimously hours after the House vote. Trump has said he would sign the bill if it passes.\n\nTrump has the authority to order the release of the full collection of Epstein documents without an act of Congress, but he has not done so.\n\nSome documents are already public. Both House Democrats and House Republicans have released thousands of pages of documents in recent weeks.\n\nHere's what Iowa's Washington delegation said about their vote.\n\nUS Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, District 1\n\nU.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican who represents southeastern Iowa's 1st Congressional District, said in her Nov. 10 town hall in Keosauqua it was important to consider the victims in releasing the Epstein files.\n\n\"We have to allow those individuals to protect their anonymity if they want their anonymity protected to allow them to tell their stories, which they have,\" Miller-Meeks said. \"There have been hearings in D.C. where several of the victims have come forward with their stories, but we need to seek justice for them, not at their expense.\"\n\nIn a statement following the vote, Miller-Meeks said she voted for \"full transparency.\"\n\n\"The American people deserve to know the truth, and the victims deserve accountability, no matter the power, status or political connections of those involved,\" she said. \"Releasing these files is an important step toward ensuring every victim is heard, every predator is exposed and no one is ever shielded from responsibility again.\"\n\nUS Rep. Ashley Hinson, District 2\n\nU.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents northeast Iowa's 2nd District and who is seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in 2026, released a statement calling for \"transparency and accountability.\"\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein was a disgusting pedophile,\" she said. \"I've always been for full transparency and accountability for anyone who was involved in his exploitation ring. We must protect the victims and seek the full truth and justice. I am 100% committed to that, voted in favor of releasing all of the files and support continuing all investigative efforts.\"\n\nUS Rep. Zach Nunn, District 3\n\nU.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, who represents south-central Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, in a Nov. 17 interview touted legislation he has led to protect abuse victims and hold repeat violent offenders accountable.\n\nHe said survivors deserve for their information to be protected and their offenders should be held in correctional facilities for the full length of their sentences without early release.\n\n“Regardless of what anybody else, whether the president or anybody wants us to or not, it's the right thing to do,\" Nunn said of releasing the files. \"But that's only step one. Step two — the far more important step — is protecting the survivors and holding the offenders accountable. And I hope that all these people who have signed onto this discharge petition to try and make a political point are there to actually do the policy work to help victims so that this doesn't just become another news cycle.\"\n\nAfter the vote, Nunn released a statement saying \"Iowans deserve the truth.\"\n\n\"Transparency and accountability from our government isn’t optional, it’s a duty,\" he said. \"Jeffrey Epstein is a disgusting human being who committed horrific crimes. Iowans deserve the truth, victims deserve justice, and full transparency is how we deliver both.\"\n\nUS Rep. Randy Feenstra, District 4\n\nU.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who represents the 4th Congressional District in western Iowa, did not immediately release a statement following the vote.\n\nFeenstra is running for governor in 2026.\n\nUS Sen. Chuck Grassley\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa's senior senator, urged the Senate to pass the legislation.\n\n\"I've been calling for full transparency in the Epstein case since 2019,\" he posted on social media after the House vote. \"The Senate should pass ASAP.\"\n\nUS Sen. Joni Ernst\n\nU.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, Iowa's junior senator, was part of the unanimous Senate vote for the legislation. She did not immediately release a statement following the vote.\n\nDemocrats criticize Republicans for not supporting the bill sooner\n\nIowa Democrats criticized the Republican congressional delegation for only supporting the legislation \"after Trump told them they could.\"\n\n\"Iowa’s representatives showed how spineless they really are by voting to block the public from learning the truth in the Epstein Files for months, only giving in when Trump finally told them to vote for the release,\" Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement. \"It’s clear that they stand with their D.C. party bosses and powerful interests, not with Iowans and not with victims of abuse.\"\n\nIowa Democratic candidates have been calling on the state's Republican congressional delegation for weeks to join the effort to release the Epstein files.\n\nState Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, who is running for the U.S. Senate, called on Hinson to sign the discharge petition on Sept. 10. State Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, called for her to sign the petition on Nov. 12.\n\n\"She had every opportunity over the last several months to sign the discharge petition before today,\" Wahls said Nov. 18 ahead of the vote. \"We called on her to do it months ago. It was the right thing to do then. It was the right thing to do every single day that she refused to be the 218th signature on that petition. Her failure to do it to me demonstrates why she does not have what it takes to represent Iowa in the United States Senate.\"\n\nDemocrat Nathan Sage, who is running for U.S. Senate, also criticized Hinson.\n\n\"If you have to wait for Trump or any party boss to tell you it’s okay before you vote to protect victims against pedophiles, then you are spineless plain and simple,\" he posted on social media, tagging Hinson.\n\nState Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, who is running for the 3rd District, called the House vote \"long overdue.\"\n\n\"Survivors and the American people deserve the full truth — not more delays and political games from Washington insiders like Zach Nunn, who only acts when his party leaders give him cover,\" she said. \"Nunn has used his power to protect the rich and powerful, not the victims or the American people. In Congress, I’ll stand up for transparency, accountability, and the people of Iowa.\"\n\nDes Moines Register reporter Marissa Payne contributed to this article.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

Among the most vocal is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose support for releasing Epstein files has contributed to a public feud with President Donald Trump.\n\nLawmakers behind the legislation had seized on renewed focus over the disgraced financier after Democrats in the House on Nov. 12 released thousands of emails from Epstein. Several bombshell messages discussed Trump, including emails from Epstein that said Trump “spent hours at my house” with a victim and allegedly \"knew about the girls.\"\n\nAfter months of calling the Epstein investigations a \"hoax\" and a Democratic \"trap,\" Trump reversed course on Nov. 16 and called on House Republicans to vote for the full release of the files.\n\nBut even if it passes the House, the bill must still get through the Senate and be signed by the president to take effect.\n\nHere's what, exactly, lawmakers behind the Act want released.\n\nWhat is the House voting on concerning the Epstein files?\n\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act would require the Department of Justice to publicly release all the unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials related to the investigation and prosecution of Epstein.\n\nAny personal information of alleged victims would be withheld from the department in the release, as would information that could jeopardize active federal investigations. The DOJ would be required to report to Congress justifying the reason for any withheld information and redactions.\n\nWhat could be subject to release by the Epstein Files Transparency Act?\n\nUnder the proposed House bill, Attorney General Pam Bondi would have 30 days from when the Act passes to release all unclassified materials related to the convicted sex offender.\n\nThis includes all materials related to investigations, prosecutions or custodial matters involving Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, including flight logs and travel records, and individuals named or referenced in the inquiry. The bill notes that the names of government officials are subject to publication.\n\nThe Act also demands the DOJ release names of all corporate, nonprofit, academic or governmental entities with known or alleged ties to Epstein’s trafficking or financial networks, and release files related to his 2019 death by suicide while in jail awaiting trial. Any internal DOJ communications concerning decisions to charge, not charge, investigate or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates would also be released under the House Act.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

Release the Epstein files already | Opinion", "text": "Nov. 14, 2025, 4:03 a.m. ET\n\nI voted for President Donald Trump, and I support a lot of his policies and politics: Lowering taxes, brokering peace deals and ordering strikes on Iran's nuclear sites.\n\nI've never supported Trump because he had stellar character, integrity or a squeaky-clean past. I don't think he does, nor do I even know Republicans who believe he's a model of ethics.\n\nDemocrats, intent on exposing this, started releasing − piecemeal at first − emails between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and other parties. After a few emails were released, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released approximately 20,000 documents on Nov. 12.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in federal prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Democrats posit that the emails show Trump knew of Epstein's alleged child sex trafficking ring and the abuse of women and girls.\n\nTrump has denied he knew about Epstein's illegal activities.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nLet me be clear on this: If Trump has a sordid past that includes knowing about a child sex trafficking ring, as a mother and a Republican, I want to know about it. I have a right to know, and so does every other American.\n\nI'd like to know when Democrats became aware of these emails linking Epstein and Trump. If these are so damning − and they might be − why haven't they been mentioned sooner for justice to be done?\n\nI'd also like to know whether Republicans knew about these emails already, and when and why the House Oversight Committee waited until the leaked emails were published before dumping documents.\n\nWhat did Donald Trump know about Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nThe Washington Post reports that among the released emails is one Epstein wrote to himself in 2019: “Trump knew of it. and came to my house many times during that period. He never got a massage.”\n\nAnother 2019 email to author and journalist Michael Wolff says, “Of course (Trump) knew about the girls.” Epstein's email says Trump asked Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted accomplice, “to stop” but doesn’t say more.\n\nAdmittedly, the language in these emails does not look good. But right now, there's also evidence suggesting Trump didn't know what was going on.\n\nIn sworn testimony and in her posthumously published memoir, victim Virginia Giuffre refuted claims that Trump was involved in Epstein's crimes.\n\nMaxwell was convicted in New York federal court in 2021 on charges related to sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison. While questioned by the Department of Justice, she claimed Trump and Epstein were casual acquaintances, not friends, and denied that Trump was actively involved in or knew about Epstein's sex ring.\n\nIf Trump knew about the sex ring, it's important to find out what he knew and even why he kept quiet.\n\nRepublicans and Trump can end this swirling news cycle by simply releasing the files. The longer he delays, the more suspicious it looks. If Trump is in them, let due process commence and justice be done for the victims. If he remains innocent of the charges, whatever those are, we can all move on. Republicans, for the sake of their party's integrity, should demand more information.\n\nWe can't ignore the timing of Democrats pushing the Epstein emails\n\nThat said, the timing of the Democrats' release of these emails raises questions for me.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee originally subpoenaed Epstein's estate and demanded basically all communications \"on or before September 8, 2025.\"\n\nOn Sept. 16, the Oversight Committee issued a news release about the Epstein investigation. The statement by committee Chairman James Comer, R-Kentucky, said that staff had been conducting \"an in camera review\" of documents received from Epstein, and that on Sept. 12 his committee had \"released a second set of documents received from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\nThe first batch was released Sept. 8; the third batch was released Nov. 12.\n\nSo where did these new emails come from? If Democrats had them in September, would they not have been as damning then? The timing suggests a witch hunt rather than a quest for justice that the victims deserve.\n\nThe Epstein matter is not complicated, nor does it need to remain so. The Epstein files must be released so the American people can know the truth − whatever that may be.\n\nEditor's note: Michael Wolff was a freelance USA TODAY contributor from 2012 to early 2017.

After the House Oversight Committee had released more than 20,000 pages of Epstein emails on Nov. 12, Trump accused House Democrats of releasing the emails — one in which Epstein alleges Trump \"knew about the girls\" — because Democrats lost the fight over the nation's longest-ever government shutdown.\n\nThe Trump administration’s decision not to release more Epstein documents has prompted backlash and a push by Congress to get the records. A petition aimed at releasing all Epstein documents gathered enough signatures to force a vote on the issue in the House.\n\nDuring stay at Mar-a-Lago, Trump feuded with Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nTrump called former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene a \"traitor, \"a disgrace\" and a \"lightweight\" during his weekend stay at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump concluded his 14th visit this term to Mar-a-Lago on Nov. 16 and left in the evening for Washington. But other than again ripping NBC late-night TV host Seth Meyers as having \"no talent\" and calling the 2010 Affordable Care Act the \"Unaffordable Care Act,\" the president kept out of public sight at Mar-a-Lago and Trump International Golf Club while sparingly commenting on his social-media platform.\n\nThe exception being the tirades against Greene, who Trump accused of having \"gone far Left\" and of becoming \"the RINO that we all know that she always was.\" Trump also reposted numerous missives from others who called Greene a \"sellout\" and warned that her \"political future just ended.\"\n\nTrump accused Greene, known by her initials as MTG, of complaining incessantly despite \"my creating Record Achievements for our Country\" and then listing a myriad of what he called successes including on border security, tax cuts, DEI rollbacks and ending global conflicts.\n\nThe ugly break with Greene is reminiscent of prior falling outs with Elon Musk and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The schism with MTG has turned equally personal, but there is an underlying political context as well.\n\nThe rift also speaks to a clash of optics that's emerged since Trump took office. Namely, the GOP's and MAGA movement's aspiration to appeal to and identify with America's working class voters has uncomfortably juxtaposed with Trump's camaraderie with the billionaire set, the opulent gilding of the White House and the lavishness of Mar-a-Lago's galas and ambience.\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson and Joey Garrison, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/11/17"}]}

What does it mean?", "text": "Updated Dec. 1, 2025, 5:27 p.m. ET\n\nThe Oxford University Press promises it's not rage baiting with its two-word Word of the Year.\n\nThe publishing house announced on Dec. 1 that its experts have named \"rage bait\" the 2025 Word of the Year.\n\nThe phrase is shorthand for online content that is intentionally meant to elicit anger. The term has tripled in usage over the last year, according to Oxford.\n\n“The fact that the word rage bait exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we’re increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" said Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, in a press release. \"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we’ve seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"\n\nWhat does 'rage bait' mean?\n\nThe Oxford University Press defines \"rage bait\" as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content.”\n\nThe phrase is a combination of the words rage — meaning: a violent outburst of anger — and bait — meaning: an attractive morsel of food.\n\nAccording to Oxford, the term \"rage bait\" was first used online in 2002 in reference to the reaction of a driver who is flashed at by another driver requesting to pass them. The phrase then evolved into internet slang and is often used to describe viral social media posts or to critique creators and trends.\n\nCan the Word of the Year be two words?\n\nOxford said its Word of the Year doesn't have to be a singular word, because its experts also consider expressions as a single unit of meaning.\n\nLike this year's choice, last year's Oxford Word of the Year — brain rot — was also two words.\n\nThe publishing house said it determines its annual Word of the Year by analyzing data and trends to identify new and emerging words and expressions. Once its lexicographers establish a shortlist for Word of the Year, Oxford opens voting on its website.\n\nThis year, more than 30,000 people voted on the shortlist for the Word of the Year, Oxford said.\n\nSee Oxford's shortlist for Word of the Year 2025\n\nTwo other words were in the running for Oxford's Word of the Year.

While some interpret the phrase to mean \"so-so\" or \"maybe this, maybe that,\" it is also used as an exclamation, according to a Dictionary.com news release.\n\nEarlier this month, Cambridge Dictionary also announced it selected \"parasocial\" for its 2025 Word of the Year. The dictionary defines the word as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know.\"\n\nThe pick, in part, stemmed from fans' reactions to one of the year's biggest moments in pop culture, Taylor Swift's engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce, according to a news release.\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Have you broken your self-care routine more times than you can count? Do you not even care? If so, you might already be in “goblin mode” – chosen by the public as the 2022 Oxford word of the year.\n\nAccording to Oxford University Press (OUP), publishers behind the Oxford English Dictionary, the slang term refers to a type of behavior which is “unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations” – traits that may have become familiar to many during lockdown.\n\nSocial media can portray idealized versions of self-improvement, from waking at 5 a.m. and drinking a green smoothie, to keeping a journal, exercising and planning your weekly meal prep.\n\nThat era may be on the way out. In its place is goblin mode – the opposite of trying to better yourself.\n\nThe OUP word of the year – also known as the Oxford word of the year – was chosen by the public for the first time. A group of lexicographers at OUP gave people a choice of: “Goblin mode,” “metaverse,” and “#IStandWith.”\n\n“Goblin mode” triumphed, racking up 318,956 votes – 93% of the total. “Metaverse” came second and “#IStandWith” came third.\n\nCasper Grathwohl, president of OUP’s Oxford Languages, said in a press release Monday that the “level of engagement with the campaign caught us totally by surprise.”\n\n“Given the year we’ve just experienced, ‘Goblin mode’ resonates with all of us who are feeling a little overwhelmed at this point. It’s a relief to acknowledge that we’re not always the idealized, curated selves that we’re encouraged to present on our Instagram and TikTok feeds,” he said.\n\n\"Goblin mode\" was a resounding favorite among voters. ljubaphoto/E+/Getty Images\n\nThe rise of ‘goblin mode’\n\nThe term was first used in 2009 but went viral on social media earlier this year, OUP said. It shot to prominence after a fake headline claimed that the rapper formerly known as Kanye West and Julia Fox broke up after she “went goblin mode.”\n\n“The term then rose in popularity over the months following as Covid lockdown restrictions eased in many countries and people ventured out of their homes more regularly,” according to the OUP.\n\n“Seemingly, it captured the prevailing mood of individuals who rejected the idea of returning to ‘normal life’, or rebelled against the increasingly unattainable aesthetic standards and unsustainable lifestyles exhibited on social media.”\n\nThe term’s popularity may also be linked to the growth of new social media sites like BeReal, where users are invited once a day at random to post a photo of whatever they’re doing. Goodbye carefully curated social media feeds. Hello goblin mode.\n\nThe release gives examples of examples of when the term has been used. Among the most vivid was quoted in The Guardian: “Goblin mode is like when you wake up at 2am and shuffle into the kitchen wearing nothing but a long t-shirt to make a weird snack, like melted cheese on saltines.”\n\n“People are embracing their inner goblin, and voters choosing ‘goblin mode’ as the Word of the Year tells us the concept is likely here to stay,” added Grathwohl.", "authors": ["Christian Edwards"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/12/07/what-is-the-word-of-the-year-2024-brain-rot-oxford-dictionary/76710247007/", "title": "Oxford Dictionary Word of the Year 2024: What is brain rot?", "text": "Dec. 7, 2024, 4:45 a.m. ET\n\nWhile December headlines the holiday season, it's also the month in which we reflect and enjoy some of the many year-end recaps.\n\nAs we anticipated the release of Spotify Wrapped, the Oxford English Dictionary has revealed what trendy word has been crowned 2024's word of the year.\n\nOxford University Press, which publishes the Oxford English Dictionary, conduted a public vote over the course of two weeks that had more than 37,000 participants.
