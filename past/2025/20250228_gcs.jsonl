Will the solar eclipse delay Eid?", "text": "Muslims around the world are preparing to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, of the \"festival of breaking the fast,\" one of two major Muslim holidays.\n\nEid al-Fitr begins at the end of Ramadan, the holiest month in Islam when Muslims fast from sunrise to sundown and focus on prayer and self-reflection. It is expected to begin on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the sighting of the crescent moon.\n\nWhen is Ramadan over in 2024?\n\nExperts say Wednesday is far more likely because of the solar eclipse on Monday. Eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler told USA TODAY since the eclipse will happen in the early afternoon, the moon phase will be no more than 5 to 6 hours old at sunset, so it \"will not be possible to see the crescent Moon that evening.\"\n\nWhen is Eid Al-Fitr? How is Eid celebrated?\n\nEid begins when Ramadan ends. Muslims begin the three-day holiday by taking part in prayers on the morning on the first day of Eid. Families then gather for festivities, visiting relatives and sharing in large meals with traditional foods. They typically wear new clothes and buy presents for children or give them cash.\n\nMuslims also give give zakat al-Fitr, an obligatory food donation or cash equivalent that is made before the end of Ramadan. During the holiday, people wish one another Eid Mubarak, or Blessed Eid, and Happy Eid.\n\nWhat is Ramadan?\n\nRamadan is the ninth month on the Islamic calendar, when Muslims believe the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. It begins and ends with the appearance of the crescent moon.\n\nThe holy month ends with a three-day celebration know as Eid al-Fitr, although some Muslims say festivities will be toned down this year due to war in Gaza.\n\nWhy do Muslims fast during Ramadan?\n\nFasting is one of the five pillars of Islam, or key practices that a Muslim is obligated to fulfill in their lifetime. During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. They also refrain from habits such as smoking and sexual relations from dusk to dawn.\n\nAre there North Jersey Eid celebrations?\n\nThe Eid Committee of New Jersey, representing several North Jersey mosques, holds one of the largest Eid prayers services in the area. This year, the committee has arranged for prayers at the Teaneck Armory on Wednesday, April 10, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.\n\nThe Islamic Center of Passaic County will hold an Eid Night Bazaar on Tuesday from 8 p.m. to midnight at its Paterson campus at 152 Derrom Ave. It will feature a variety of vendors showcasing merchandise, clothing, street food and desserts along with a community prayer in solidarity with Gaza. Twenty percent of proceeds to be donated to Gaza.\n\nEid al-Fitr is one of two major Muslims holidays. The other, Eid al-Adha, or the \"feast of the sacrifice,\" takes place in the final or twelfth month of the Islamic calendar. It honors the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God.

The Journal Sentinel provided live coverage.\n\nMONDAY:Live updates from the Republican National Convention 2024 in Milwaukee\n\n'Unfortunately, because of state law,' city can't limit guns near RNC, Mayor Cavalier Johnson tells CNN\n\nMayor Cavalier Johnson pointed a finger at the state legislature for allowing guns near the Republican National Convention.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because of state law, we are not able to enact more restrictions for individuals who may decide to carry guns,\" Johnson said in an interview with CNN Monday night.\n\nJohnson said he's confident in the security protocols for the RNC this week.\n\nStill, Johnson said, the City of Milwaukee would've liked to do more to regulate firearms around the convention. State law, however, prohibits cities from imposing gun regulations that are stricter than state law.\n\nFirearms are banned from the \"hard,\" credentials-only security perimeter around Fiserv Forum, but are allowed in the area just outside the perimeter — the so-called security \"footprint.\"\n\nGovernor Tony Evers asked the Secret Service to tell the Republican National Committee to reconsider that policy.\n\n\"I don't think that's a Secret Service issue,\" Johnson said, when asked about Evers' request on CNN. \"I think that's a State of Wisconsin issue.\"\n\n-- Genevieve Redsten\n\nUnder existing plans most guns would not be banned in an area immediately outside the RNC perimeter.\n\nTrump will appear at the convention on Monday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will make an appearance Monday at the Republican National Convention, said RNC committee member David Bossie in an interview with WISN-TV (Channel 12).\n\n\"The welcome that he's going to get here, I think, is going to be a very emotional and overwhelming thing,\" Bossie told WISN.\n\nTrump has yet to name his vice presidential pick.

Many waited for over two hours.\n\nSome filmed or photographed the plane landing on their phones.\n\nNext to the park on Brust Avenue, onlookers in four cars waited for the former president’s arrival, some standing outside their cars and looking up at the sky. Andrew G (who declined to give his last name to a reporter). of Milwaukee, who’d been waiting near the airport for at least three hours, stood outside his car waving a large American flag.\n\n-- Claire Reid\n\nSmoke near Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport from car fire, no impacts on airport\n\nReports of black smoke and emergency vehicles near the Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport were due to a car that malfunctioned and caught fire on an exit ramp near the airport, airport director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said.\n\nThe fire has since been put out.

Evers seeks to bar firearms from RNC soft perimeter\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has requested that the decision to allow firearms within the soft perimeter of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee be reconsidered \"immediately\" following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, a source with knowledge of the discussion shared with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe request was made to the U.S. Secret Service, which would relay the governor's concerns to the Republican National Committee, the source said.\n\nBut the request appears likely to go nowhere. The power to ban firearms in the security \"footprint\" outside the credentials-only \"hard\" security zone seems to rest with the state, not the Secret Service, the RNC or the City of Milwaukee.\n\nRead full story\n\n-- Jessie Opoien\n\nThe Great Milwaukee Block Party hosts puppet-making event\n\nMembers of a UWM student puppet club and various other groups met Saturday and Sunday at Tooth + Nail Studio and Gallery to create puppets from cardboard, paper mache and paint.\n\nThe event was hosted by Milwaukee activist and artist Susan Simensky Bietila and Nora Leccese, a community organizer. Both are participating in the Great Milwaukee Block Party, which is hosting a “collection of events to connect the Milwaukee community in acts of joyful rebellion during the RNC” between July 13 and 20, according to the group’s Instagram page.\n\n“This is part of bring people together in a positive way,” said Simensky Bietila, who has been creating activist art since the mid -1960s.\n\nShe said the group of artists are “generally people who are not supporters of Trump.” Instead of demonstrating downtown, they want to bring people from across the city together through “doing art and teaching skills.”\n\nMany of the puppets resembled animals, including a paper maché and cardboard otter designed by Leccese that can be worn as a hat or on her arm. She said it represents clean water. Another artist created an intricate cardboard bird and another created a painted owl to wear on her head. Simensky Bietila said her own work often addresses clean water and environmental advocacy.\n\nLeccese said she thinks elected officials “made a big mistake” in inviting the RNC to Milwaukee.\n\n“[They] invited a bunch of people here who don’t generally like the population of this city,” she said. “We wanted to create safe places outside of downtown for people to come be in joyful resistance together.”\n\nLeccese said they chose puppets because they tell a great story and encourage people to be involved in politics and demonstrations.\n\n-- Claire Reid\n\nInside a quiet Fiserv Forum, RNC staff and media prepare for busy week\n\nThe inside of Fiserv Forum was a focused and quiet atmosphere a day before the big show.\n\nNational TV networks workers lugged wagons of camera equipment into their media suites.

Muslims believe that God revealed the first verses of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel during Ramadan.\n\nTyler Mallari, a spokesperson with the Zakat Foundation previously told USA TODAY that Ramadan \"is a time for Muslims to come together, focus on their spiritual and personal development and spend time giving charity and gathering with their community for prayers and events.\"\n\nWhen does Ramadan begin?\n\nRamadan is expected to begin around March 1 and last through around March 29, according to the Islamic Network Group.\n\nThe exact date always depends on the sighting of the crescent moon.\n\nThe holy month moves approximately 11 days earlier each year as the Muslim faith follows a lunar calendar that is 11 days shorter than the solar calendar.\n\nWhy is there fasting during Ramadan?\n\nAdherents to the Islamic faith who have reached puberty and are physically capable fast from sunrise to sunset every day during Ramadan. The fast includes abstaining from food, drink and sexual relations.\n\nMuslims are also to avoid negative actions during the month, including gossiping, backbiting, lying or arguing, according to the Islamic Network Group.\n\nThose who are sick, women who are pregnant or nursing and those traveling are exempted.\n\nChildren who have not reached puberty are not required to fast for the entire month but some may participate in periods of symbolic fasting, according to the Islamic Network Group.\n\nFasting may also be accompanied by a more serious study of the Quran throughout the month.\n\n\"The idea is to cultivate awareness of God. Taqwa in Arabic,\" Imam Ebad Rahman, Religious Life Associate for Muslim Life at Columbia University, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nOther ways Ramadan is observed\n\nMosques may hold Iftars, or dinners to break the fast nightly during Ramadan that are open to the wider community. Families and friends may also hold Iftars at home. Mosques may also hold open houses and food drives during the holy month.\n\n\"Muslims are encouraged to embody a charitable spirit in Ramadan in order to benefit their local and broader communities alongside their own personal spiritual development. Through their Ramadan charity, Muslims strive to take care of their neighbors and those around the world in need,\" Mallari said.\n\nEach night, Imams may recite one thirtieth of the Quran in a special nightly prayer so that the entire holy book will be read by the end of the month, according to the Islamic Network Group.\n\nThe last ten nights of Ramadan are considered to be especially sacred with the holiest night of Ramadan, Laylat Al-Qadr, falling on one of those nights.\n\nIt's not known when Laylat al-Qadr, known as the “Night of Power” will be, but many believe it most likely falls on any of the odd nights in the last ten nights of Ramadan. Good deeds are believed to be significantly multiplied on that night, and Muslims may spend the night in reflection, prayer and doing other good deeds.\n\nEid Al-Fitr: How Ramadan ends\n\nThe day after Ramadan ends starts one of the major holidays in the Islamic calendar: Eid Al-Fitr, or the Festival of Breaking the Fast.\n\nEid Al-Fitr is a three-day festival that will start around March 30, but like the start of Ramadan is dependent on the sighting of the crescent moon, according to the Islamic Network Group.\n\nThe holiday is celebrated with special prayers, sweets, presents for children and community festivals.\n\nContributing: Sarah Al-Arshani", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/30/diwali-2024-what-when-hindu-holiday/75914957007/", "title": "When is Diwali 2024?

The guru was in prison and refused to leave prison without the other 52 political prisoners being released.

The next day, they decorate using clay lamps, candles and other lights and draw colorful patterns of flowers, powder, rice or sand on the floor, an artistic practice called rangoli meant to bring good luck.\n\nThe main celebration takes place on the night of the third day, which marks the end of the Hindu calendar year. Devotees dress up in their finest outfits, make offerings to Lakshmi, light fireworks and sparklers, and enjoy a sweet feast.\n\nOver the next two days the celebrations continue as people host gatherings and visit family and friends to celebrate the new year.\n\nFor Hindus, Diwali is also a time for dana (charitable giving) and seva (selfless service), according to the Hindu American Foundation.\n\nContributing: Michelle Shen, USA TODAY\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nThe 2024 total solar eclipse is now less than one week away, and forecasters are getting a clearer picture of what the skies will look like. It's not all good news for people who want to see the spectacle.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, April 8, a total eclipse of the sun will cross over a dozen states as it traverses from Texas to Maine. Millions of people are expected to travel to see it.\n\nThe full total solar eclipse experience will plunge people along a narrow path into darkness midday, but people outside the path of totality can still use eclipse glasses (maybe free eclipse glasses) to see the moon pass in front of the sun — if it's not blocked by clouds.\n\nMeanwhile, those planning to order glasses online may be rapidly running out of time to do so in order to have them delivered on time.\n\nHere's the latest weather forecast for the day of the eclipse:\n\nA grim forecast for Texas\n\nUnfortunately, the weather is looking iffy for folks in some places, especially Southern areas: The cloud cover forecast \"shows fairly high probability of clouds in Texas up through the Mississippi Valley,\" wrote meteorologist Matt Lanza on his blog The Eyewall.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Dallas said there's only a dismal 15% chance for favorable viewing conditions in Dallas on April 8. \"The outlook for favorable viewing conditions continues to deteriorate as the event approaches,\" the weather service said.\n\nIndeed, the computer models that meteorologists use to forecast weather show a grim forecast for Texas: \"The operational runs of both the GFS and European models have, consistently, shown nearly 100 percent cloud cover across much of the state during the early afternoon hours on Monday,\" said Eric Berger, a Houston-based meteorologist on the blog Space City Weather.\n\nAnother forecaster, Marc Chenard of the Weather Prediction Center, confirmed the gloomy forecast to USA TODAY: \"Cloud cover is most likely in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas,\" he said. In fact, \"varying degrees of cloudiness\" are likely all the way to the Ohio Valley, he said.\n\nCould there be storms on Monday?\n\nMonday may not only be cloudy in some areas, it could also be stormy, forecasters said: \"At this time, specifics about hazardous weather are unknown,\" the Weather Prediction Center said. \"However, rain and thunderstorms do appear possible in and near the path of totality in Texas, southeast Oklahoma, and Arkansas.\"\n\nWhere is the best chance for clear skies for the total eclipse?\n\nFor the total eclipse, the best chances for clear conditions are in New England and upstate New York, Chenard told USA TODAY.\n\n\"If I’m picking a place right now, it’s probably like Watertown, New York,\" Lanza said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Buffalo is also bullish on the chances for good weather, with a caveat: The forecast continues to suggest dry weather for Monday with high pressure over the eastern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, \"however it is FAR too early to forecast cloud cover with any confidence or reliability,\" the weather service wrote in its forecast discussion.\n\nIronically, the prediction of clouds in Texas and clear skies in the Northeast are the opposite of historical trends for cloud cover.\n\nWhere is the cloud forecast best for the partial eclipse?\n\nThere will also be ample opportunities for folks to view the partial eclipse: \"The best locations for viewing can be the Southwest and the East, especially east of the Appalachians,\" AccuWeather lead long-range forecaster Paul Pastelok said. \"Cities like El Paso, Albuquerque, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., New York City and Raleigh should all have great views.\"\n\nAlthough not in the path of totality, regions in the Southwest also look to have ideal weather.\n\n\"The area from West Texas to southern Arizona should also have favorable viewing conditions,\" Pastelok added. \"These areas will be close to the path of totality with the least amount of cloud cover anticipated.\"\n\nOrder eclipse glasses online now to have them delivered on time\n\nIf you're buying your specs through American Paper Optics, the nation's largest supplier of eclipse glasses, the company makes it easy for you with a countdown at the top of its website for how much longer you have to procrastinate. As of Tuesday morning, customers have little more than three days to make their purchase and take advantage of the company's express shipping across the country.\n\nThat's about the same amount of time allotted to Walmart+ online shoppers, as well as Prime members looking for reputable glasses on Amazon.\n\nMany eclipse websites like GreatAmericanEclipse.com and NationalEclipse.com also sell a variety of eyewear products, along with plenty of other gadgets — but double check that estimated delivery date before checking out.\n\nHow do I watch the 2024 solar eclipse, if clouds don't block it?\n\nThere are a few ways of watching the eclipse:\n\nGet the full experience in person : If you're in a narrow band of U.S. land that spans from Texas to Maine, you could see the moon block the sun and its shadow cast a night-like darkness over Earth for a few minutes. You could briefly be able to look up without eye protection and see the moon block the sun.\n\n: If you're in a narrow band of U.S. land that spans from Texas to Maine, you could see the moon block the sun and its shadow cast a night-like darkness over Earth for a few minutes.

Watch from outside the path of totality : Much of the U.S. could get a partial view of the eclipse that isn't nearly as impressive as being in the path of totality.

Watch a livestream: Check back on April 8 for a video feed from the path of totality. It's not the same as being there in person, but hey, at least you won't have to sit in traffic.\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse on April 8?\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT and end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT, but the exact time of the eclipse varies by where you are in its path.\n\nHere are the major cities in each state where you can expect to experience totality (note that the included times do not account for when the partial eclipse begins and ends):\n\nDallas, Texas: 1:40-1:44 p.m. CDT\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma: 1:45-1:49 p.m. CDT\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas: 1:51-1:54 p.m. CDT\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri: 1:56-2:00 p.m. CDT\n\nPaducah, Kentucky: 2-2:02 p.m. CDT\n\nCarbondale, Illinois: 1:59-2:03 p.m. CDT\n\nEvansville, Indiana: 2:02-2:05 p.m. CDT\n\nCleveland, Ohio: 3:13-3:17 p.m. EDT\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 3:16-3:20 p.m. EDT\n\nBuffalo, New York: 3:18-3:22 p.m. EDT\n\nBurlington, Vermont: 3:26-3:29 p.m. EDT\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire: 3:27-3:30 p.m. EDT\n\nCaribou, Maine: 3:32-3:34 p.m. EDT\n\nWill clouds really ruin the eclipse?\n\nClouds are just part of weather, and as noted in the latest forecast, it's likely that some of the millions of people in the path of totality for April's total eclipse will have to endure overcast skies that will impact the experience.\n\nBut determining how clouds would change your view depends on the types of clouds – and which expert you ask. Some advise eclipse watchers to not worry about the skies, others say an overcast sky can ruin the experience.\n\nBefore last year's annular solar eclipse, National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Daldrup told Oregon Public Radio that if clouds are in the forecast, you should hope for the \"right kind of clouds.\"\n\n“If we want to see it, we’ll want the higher-level clouds,” Daldrup told OPR. “Those tend to be the more feathery cirrus clouds that can still be seen through.

And when is it set to start?", "text": "Don't start dusting off the seder plate just yet, Passover doesn't start for another few weeks.\n\nPassover, or Pesach, is a major Jewish holiday during the month of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar. It usually falls on a day in March or April. In 2024, Passover will begin a couple of weeks after it did in 2023.\n\nThe week is marked by a ceremony that celebrates the Jewish Festival of Freedom. It starts with a traditional seder meal that is choreographed with a script. It allows those partaking in the holiday to reflect on their rich background while enjoying a few bowls of matzoh ball soup.\n\nPesach, which is Hebrew for \"Passover\", demands that Jewish people become engrossed with their ancient story and revel in both the bitter and the sweet aspects of their history.\n\nBut what is Passover? Should you wish a Jewish friend or coworker a happy Passover? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nAre Good Friday and Passover related?What the holy day means for Christians around the world\n\nWhen is Passover 2024?\n\nThis year, Passover begin before sundown on Monday, April 22 and ends after nightfall on April 30 in the United States. Many Jewish communities will hold seders the first two nights of the springtime holiday.\n\nLast year, however, it began at sundown Wednesday, on April 5 and ended at sundown Thursday, April 13.\n\nPassover is sacred and widely celebrated\n\nThe holiday is observed with seders among families, friends and communities, as well as other sacred traditions.\n\nPassover “is one of the most widely celebrated of Jewish holidays,” Aaron Kaufman, executive director of Penn State Hillel, explained to USA TODAY. “It commemorates the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt as told in the Bible.”\n\nWhat is Purim? Everything to know about the Jewish holiday, from costumes to hamantaschen\n\nWhat is Passover?\n\nRabbi Benjamin Berger, vice president of Jewish education at Hillel International, said Passover is known as the “festival of freedom.”\n\n“It's a celebration of not only the freedom of the Jewish people emerging from slavery in Egypt, and a tradition that results that is about remembering, and really putting ourselves in the shoes of those slaves and those who experienced the release from bondage, but also it reminds us of the freedom of all people,” he said.\n\n“Anyone who's experiencing oppression of some sort, whether it's external, from other people, or internal, from our own sense of the things that oppress us internally,” he added.\n\nRabbi Maya Zinkow, senior Jewish educator at UC Berkeley Hillel, told USA TODAY Passover \"celebrates the movement from slavery to liberation.\"\n\n\"So, we commemorate the time when the Jewish people really became a Jewish people. It's really the story of the birth of our peoplehood,” she said.\n\nHow is Passover celebrated?\n\nJewish people observing Passover will often gather for a seder, which Kaufman called “the ritual combination of service and dinner.”\n\nSome Jewish families or groups will display a seder plate, the “centerpiece” of seders that hold symbolic foods marking the holiday, Zinkow said. For example, maror, or bitter herbs, represent the bitterness of slavery.\n\nSeders involve moving through a book called a Haggadah, which contains stories, prayers, poetry and other teachings.\n\nOne element of seders is the recitation of the “four questions,” which are “about how this night is different than all other nights,” Berger said.\n\nBut different families or communities will use different Haggadahs during Passover. Zinkow explained that during Passover “we are really meant to envision ourselves as a part of the story. And the thing that helps us do that is the Haggadah.”\n\n“Every single Haggadah will have the same general order of events. Every single Hagaddah is going to have the same central component, but they each have a different take on the story,” she noted.\n\n“And so if every single Jew is obligated to see themselves as a part of the story, the Haggadah is meant to help us do that, right? So, a feminist Hagaddah can help women see themselves as central to the story. A queer Haggadah can help queer people locate themselves in a story. All kinds of communities, from marginalized communities to people who have maybe no trouble seeing themselves as a part of the story,” she added.\n\nWhat foods are eaten (or not eaten) during Passover?\n\nMany Jews during Passover do not eat certain leavened foods, known as chametz. Kaufman explained that the dietary changes “reflect the plight of the Israelites as they left Egypt,”\n\nMatzo, an unleavened bread, “is the key and most well-known symbol of Passover,” Berger said.\n\nKaufman explained that “As the story goes, the Israelites had to leave Egypt so quickly, they didn't have time to bake their breads.”\n\n“They needed provisions for the long journey through the desert. So they had their dough, and they just threw it in their packs, and it baked on their backs in the heat of the sun into this flat cracker-like substance,” he said.\n\nBerger noted that “we call it the bread of affliction in order to commemorate that experience.\"\n\n\"But at the same time, we also call it the bread of freedom because our ability to sit wherever we sit in the homes that we sit in around the table, and actually to eat it in a way that satiates us,” he added. “That is considered one of the greatest luxuries because it means that we're alive, and we have the ability to eat in freedom.”\n\nWhat is the afikomen?\n\nThe afikomen is also part of many seders.\n\n“At the beginning of the seder, one part of the ritual is there's three pieces of matzo on the table, and one is broken in half and set aside, and that becomes afikomen. And it is the last thing we eat at the Passover seder meal,” Kaufman said.\n\nIn some families, the afikomen is hidden. Sometimes parents hide the piece of matzo, and children search for it. But in other families, children are in charge of hiding the afikomen while parents have to look.\n\nShould I say “Happy Passover” or other greetings?\n\nIf you want to greet a loved one who is celebrating Passover, “Happy Passover” is an appropriate sentiment.\n\nYou could also say “chag sameach,” which means happy holiday in Hebrew, or chag kasher v’semeach, which means have a happy and kosher Passover.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/01/2025-holiday-schedule-calendar-list/77365105007/", "title": "2025 holiday schedule: Full list of dates for federal holidays, more", "text": "Welcome to the new year.\n\nThough 2025 has just begun, calendars are already being marked with holiday observances.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management lists 12 federal holidays across 11 days.

The ceremony, which also can be performed by a minister or pastor, is meant to show that a person belongs to Jesus Christ, and it also represents a person's grief and mourning for their sins — the same sins that Christians believe Jesus Christ gave his life for when he died on the cross.\n\nMardi Gras:What is it, and how do people celebrate every year\n\nAsh Wednesday is important because it marks the start of the Lenten period leading up to Easter, when Christians believe Jesus died and was resurrected. During this period, Christians show repentance and mourning for their sins, because they believe that Christ died for them.\n\nWhen the priest applies the cross of ashes, he says to the worshiper: \"“Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.” He also may say “Repent and believe in the Gospel.”\n\nIt is not required that a worshiper wear the ashes for the rest of the day, although many Christians choose to do so. However, dining out or doing non-essential shopping are considered inappropriate on Ash Wednesday.\n\nWhere do the ashes come from?\n\nTraditionally, ashes used on Ash Wednesday are gathered up after palms from the previous year's Palm Sunday are burned. They are then blessed before being used in the ceremony.\n\nPalms are used on Palm Sunday in many Christian churches to symbolize Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem on the Sunday before his crucifixion on Easter. Residents of Jerusalem are said to have waved palm fronds to celebrate his arrival.\n\nCan Catholics eat meat on Ash Wednesday?\n\nNo. Catholics are not supposed to eat meat on Ash Wednesday. They also are expected to give up meat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nCatholics are expected to fast on Ash Wednesday. Fasting means consuming only one full meal a day; two smaller meals that don't together add up to a full meal also are allowed.\n\nChildren and the elderly are exempt from the fasting requirement on Ash Wednesday and during Lent.\n\nIntermittent fasting:This man fasts from 17 to 24 hours a day. Here's how he says it's changed his life.\n\nIs Ash Wednesday based on a pagan festival?\n\nNo. Early Christians in Rome were sprinkled with ashes during Lent, but the Ash Wednesday practice of placing ashes on the forehead of Christians didn't begin until the Middle Ages.\n\nWhen is Ash Wednesday in 2019?\n\nAsh Wednesday falls on a different day each year, because it is dependent on the date of Easter. It can occur as early as Feb. 4 or as late as March 10.\n\nThis year, Ash Wednesday is Wednesday, March 6.\n\nWhat is Lent?\n\nAsh Wednesday is one of the most important on the Christian calendar, because it marks the start of Lent.\n\nLent is a six-week period of fasting, self-sacrifice and prayer observed by Christians each year to prepare for the celebration of Easter, when they believe Christ rose from the dead to sit at the right hand of God, his father.\n\nLent is celebrated over 46 days. It includes 40 days of fasting and six Sundays, on which fasting is not practiced.\n\nThe 40-day period has a special significance in the Old and New Testaments. For instance, Moses spent 40 days and nights with God on Mount Sinai in preparation to receive the Ten Commandments. Jesus also is depicted as being led into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil for 40 days.\n\nLent turns digital:Churches try Facebook Live videos, Instagram hashtags\n\nThings to give up for Lent\n\nMany people want to know what they should give up for Lent to prove your devotion.\n\nMany people give up things that they love, such as candy or sweets, favorite foods, television or — gasp! — social media.\n\nThe reason for their self-sacrifice: Christians want to replicate the hardships felt by Jesus during his 40 days in the desert.\n\nFollow Dwight Adams on Twitter: @hdwightadams.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/05"}]}

A late campaign surge by the far-left Die Linke party gave it 9% of the vote while breakaway leftist party BSW led by Sahra Wagenknecht squeezed in on 5%.\n\nThe results set the stage for protracted coalition talks and likely mean a three-way coalition made up of one or two of the three same parties that were part of Scholz’s unpopular alliance that collapsed in November.\n\nMerz, 69, has no previous government experience but has promised to provide greater leadership than Scholz and to liaise more with key allies, restoring Germany to the heart of Europe.\n\nA brash economic liberal who has shifted the conservatives to the right, he is considered the antithesis of former conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel, who led Germany for 16 years.\n\nShort of a majority in an increasingly fragmented political landscape, however, his conservatives will have to sound out partners to form a coalition.\n\nThose negotiations are certain to be tricky after a campaign which exposed sharp divisions over migration and how to deal with the AfD in a country where far-right politics carry a particularly strong stigma due to its Nazi past.\n\nThat could leave Scholz in a caretaker role for months, delaying urgently needed policies to revive Europe’s largest economy after two consecutive years of contraction and as companies struggle against global rivals.\n\nIt would also create a leadership vacuum in the heart of Europe even as it deals with a host of challenges including Trump threatening a trade war and attempting to fast-track a ceasefire deal for Ukraine without European involvement.\n\nGermany, which has an export-oriented economy and long relied on the United States for its security, is particularly vulnerable.\n\nGermans are more pessimistic about their living standards now than at any time since the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nAttitudes towards migration have also hardened, a profound shift in German public sentiment since its “Refugees Welcome” culture during Europe’s migrant crisis in 2015, that the AfD has both driven and harnessed.\n\nElon Musk and JD Vance back German far-right\n\nSunday’s election came after the collapse last November of Scholz’s coalition of his SPD, the Greens and pro-market FDP in a row over budget spending.\n\nThe election campaign has been dominated by fierce exchanges over the perception that irregular immigration is out of control, fuelled by a series of attacks in which the suspected perpetrators were of migrant origin.\n\nIt has also been overshadowed by the unusually forceful show of solidarity by members of the Trump administration – including Vice President JD Vance and tech billionaire Elon Musk - for the anti-migrant AfD, and broadsides against European leaders.\n\nThe 12-year old AfD party took second place for the first time in a national election, according to the exit polls.\n\nTo be sure, the AfD is unlikely to govern for now as all mainstream parties have ruled out working with it, though some analysts believe its strength could pave the way for an AfD win in 2029.\n\nSupport for the AfD, along with a small but significant vote share for the far left and the decline of Germany’s big-tent parties, is increasingly complicating the formation of coalitions and governance.\n\nEU allies are cautiously hopeful the elections might deliver a more coherent government able to help drive forward policy at home and in the bloc.\n\nSome also hope Merz will reform the \"debt brake\", a constitutional mechanism to limit government borrowing that critics say has strangled new investment.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/24/germany-far-right-party-afd-election-wins/79891861007/", "title": "Boosted by Musk, far-right German party makes huge gains in election", "text": "An extreme right-wing German party endorsed by Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance surged in the country's Sunday election, winning the broadest support of any far-right party in Germany since World War II.\n\nAlternative for Germany (AfD) came in second with 20% of the vote, its best election results since its founding just over a decade ago. While AfD didn't take home a majority, it squeezed votes away from Germany's moderate liberal and conservative parties – another sign of the rise of extreme right-wing parties in Europe.\n\nAlthough the country's opposition conservative bloc won with 28.5%, it was the second-lowest percentage of the vote it had ever received. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose representatives have been among the leading political voices in the country for decades, suffered its worst returns since World War II, taking home just 16.5% of the vote.\n\nAfD's rise in popularity has been bolstered by far-right online communities. Party leaders have prompted widespread outrage over their inflammatory and Islamophobic statements. Critics have branded the movement \"racist\" and \"anti-democracy.\" The rise in AfD's popularity has been especially painful for Jews in Germany, who see it echoing the messaging of the Holocaust.\n\nWhy are Elon Musk and JD Vance praising AfD?\n\nMusk, the billionaire orchestrator of President Donald Trump's sweeping layoffs of federal employees and dismantling of government agencies, is an enthusiastic supporter of AfD. In December, he officially endorsed the party, posting on his social media platform X, \"Only the AfD can save Germany.\"\n\nHe also hosted a conversation on X with Alice Weidel, AfD's candidate for chancellor.\n\n\"People really need to get behind AfD, otherwise things are going to get very, very much worse in Germany,\" he said.\n\nMusk has also picked up the AfD's openly anti-Islamic talking points in his posts, including the baseless claim that Islamic immigrants to Germany commit rape at a higher rate than the rest of the population.\n\nThe conversation, and Musk's leveraging of X to blast his support for AfD across the internet, led German regulators to investigate Musk for election interference.\n\nOn a trip to Germany earlier this month, Vance met with Weidel but did not meet with Scholz, the sitting chancellor of Germany, a clear snub.\n\nSpeaking to the Munich Security Conference that day, Vance deepened the Trump administration's rift with longstanding European allies, Germany included. He accused European leaders of censorship and criticized them for letting in migrants and further aligned himself with Weidel.\n\nAsked about AfD in a Wall Street Journal interview this month, Vance implied that the German government was \"censoring\" the party. \"If the people keep on saying we’re pissed off about something, we’re frustrated about something, you can’t say we’re going to ban, censor, silence this group of people,\" he said. \"You have to listen to them, even if they’re a minority.\"\n\nSo is AfD pro-Nazi?\n\nAfter World War II, Germany put together restrictions on far-right parties to prevent the rise of another Nazi party.\n\nAfD was the first party to run afoul of those guardrails. Germany's domestic surveillance agency, tasked with enforcing those restrictions, said in 2021 that it would conduct continued surveillance on the party – an unprecedented step. It made that decision after a two-year investigation of AfD's messaging, reviewing its politicians' comments comparing Muslim migrants to animals and downplaying Germany's Nazi past.\n\nAfD functions under government restrictions crafted after World War II to prevent the rise of another Nazi party. The government can surveil messaging it finds violate the rules and prosecute people for saying Nazi slogans or using Nazi symbols in public places.\n\nMore:Whiplash: Trump's U-turn on Ukraine war after 3 years of US support\n\nLast January, protests calling for the AfD to be banned exploded in cities across Germany after an investigative report revealed that the party's leaders met secretly with wealthy businesspeople to discuss a plan for forced mass deportations in Germany.\n\nMaximilian Krah, AfD's representative to the European Union parliament, told the Italian daily La Repubblica in May that not all of the SS – the Nazi's violent paramilitary officers – were criminals. He was forced shortly thereafter to step down from AfD's leadership board. The comments also caused a rift with France's far-right party, which kicked AfD out of its EU coalition.\n\nBjoern Hoecke, AfD's leader in eastern Germany, was twice convicted of shouting a Nazi phrase at a rally. Hoecke has also said Germany should stop feeling shame for its Nazi past, calling the country's Holocaust memorial a \"monument of shame.\"\n\nAfD is open about its opposition to Islam in Germany. A 2016 document adopted by the party calls for a ban on the Muslim call to prayer and the minarets seen on mosques, calling them \"Islamic symbols of power.\" The party has also tried to ban headscarves for women.\n\nThe party's leaders seized on three knife attacks carried out in the past year by Afghan and Syrian immigrants to ignite Islamophobic sentiment, bolstered by false claims that Muslim migrants are more violent – the same claims about Muslim migrants that Musk has frequently touted.\n\nFalse claims about immigrants committing crimes at higher rates than the overall population are also a frequent Trump talking point. The president has used this messaging to justify his ongoing mass deportation push.\n\nMore:Who is Friedrich Merz? Meet the conservative leader taking the reins of the German chancellery\n\nAfD's leaders seized on the attacks to call for an end to Muslim migration and multiculturalism. \"Free yourselves, finally put an end to the wrong path of forced multiculturalization!” Hoecke wrote on X after the second attack in August.\n\nAfter an Afghan man was implicated in the most recent knife attack, which killed two in the town of Aschaffenburg last month, AfD called for a total shutdown of Germany's borders.\n\nFriedrich Merz, the leader of the conservative bloc that won this month's election, also hardened his position on immigration, tilting toward the AfD platform and stirring fear among Germany's left of a coming coalition between the far- and moderate-right.\n\nWho will be the next chancellor?\n\nMerz, of the opposition conservative party, is now on the path to becoming chancellor.

Only the CDU had a higher level of support, at 29%.\n\nThe AfD “seems to be scoring points among voters on two political stances in particular: opposing immigration and climate protection”, said Deutsche Welle.\n\nThe party has long claimed that “there is a threat to German culture”, political analyst Johannes Hillje told taz newspaper, and that “this came from the outside, through migrants”. But, he added, “now the narrative is that this threat is also coming from within, through the transformation of society to climate neutrality – a central project of the centre-left coalition in Berlin and the Green Party”.\n\nSince the government unveiled plans to phase out gas- and oil-fired boilers and move to renewable heat pumps, discontent has “reached a new peak in Sonneberg and in many other towns and cities in Germany”, said the FT.\n\n“The cheek of it, it’s just unbelievable,” an AfD voter reportedly said. “I don’t need a new boiler, mine works very well, thank you, and they can’t force me to replace it.”\n\n‘Lack of trust in established parties’\n\nThe election result in Sonneberg has triggered a “frantic search for explanations” and a blame game between Germany’s other parties, said historian Katja Hoyer in The Spectator. That close to one in five people seem willing to vote for “a relatively new party which contains many far-right extremists shows their lack of trust in the established political spectrum”, she wrote, and “in its willingness to solve the big issues of the day”.\n\nThe “overall mood in Germany is increasingly grim”, said Ronald G. Asch, former chair of early modern history at the Iniversity of Freiburg. “However crude its rhetoric may be”, he wrote for The Critic, the AfD is good at “giving a voice to this discontent”.\n\nAnd the spread of such discontent means the German political system is likely to become “even more unstable over the next couple of years”, Asch added. German politicians may “learn the hard way that telling fairy tales to voters such as ‘the Euro and European integration policies will make you ever more prosperous’ will only take you so far”.", "authors": ["Jamie Timson", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/961734/spains-uncertain-political-future-after-election-deadlock", "title": "Spain's uncertain political future after election deadlock | The Week", "text": "Spain is facing months of political gridlock after parliamentary elections saw the conservative bloc fail to win enough votes to form a government.\n\nSocialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called Sunday’s vote following a wipeout at regional and municipal elections in May.

The far-right Vox party saw its vote share drop from 15.1% in 2019 to 12.4%, just above the new left-wing coalition Sumar.\n\nWith all votes counted, PP and Vox had secured 169 seats, while PSOE and Sumar had 153 – both well below the 176 needed to form a majority. The result leaves Spain facing “political stalemate, uncertainty and weeks or months of negotiations”, said The Times.\n\nWho were the winners and losers?\n\nFor the past week commentators have focused on the surge of the hard right, a pattern seen across Europe. “That, as it turned out, was not the main story,” said The Economist. Experts in Spain and elsewhere failed “to reckon with Spain’s comeback-artist-in-chief: Pedro Sánchez”.\n\n“A high-stakes political gambler,” as The Times described him, Sánchez “is prone to take monumental risks and his last one, to call a snap election, paid off”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHis surprise showing, which saw PSOE actually gain two seats, means he can now try to “cobble together the 2.0 version of his coalition, which the right dubbed a ‘Frankenstein government’ of far-left and separatist allies”, said the paper.\n\nBy contrast, PP leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo appears to have suffered from his decision to enter into more regional and municipal coalitions with the far-right following May’s elections.\n\n“The chaotic outcome of these coalitions – which included bans on LGBT+ flags, culture wars over theatre and the closing of bike lanes – had two effects,” said the Financial Times. It turned out to be a “great motivator for many voters on the left”, and it also “dulled the enthusiasm of some centre-right PP voters who already had misgivings about Vox”.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nForming parliamentary majorities has been a “puzzle in Spain since the country effectively abandoned bipartisanship in 2015”, reported El Pais. Eight years later, “although the two main parties concentrate most of the votes, the labyrinth of Congress has become even more complicated, and it is very difficult to conjecture what the way out may be”.\n\nOn Sunday night, as the tightness of the race became clear, Feijóo said he would attempt to form a minority government but “right now [he] does not have the backing needed to make his candidacy for prime minister viable”, said Politico.\n\nThe problem, reported The Guardian, is that entering into coalition with the far-right “has not endeared the PP to more moderate parties, which simply won’t entertain supporting an alliance that includes Vox, an anti-feminist, anti-immigrant party that denies the existence of gender-based violence and human-made climate change”.\n\nAny attempt by Feijóo to try to forge a minority government would be sunk by the PSOE’s refusal to back it or to abstain to allow it into office.\n\nSánchez, meanwhile, has a “possible – though extremely complex – route to victory”, said Politico.\n\nAlthough the left-wing bloc is unlikely to secure the backing of the 176 MPs needed for Sánchez to be confirmed as prime minister when parliament reconvenes on 17 August, it could make a bid during the second round of voting, in which the candidate to head the new government only needs to receive more yeas than nays.\n\nThis could see Sánchez call on regional partners, most notably the Basque and Catalan separatist parties, to abstain in exchange for concessions. This is in itself would prove controversial.\n\nIf no candidate secures a majority within two months of the first vote on the prime minister, new elections must be held.\n\nLooking at the parliamentary arithmetic as it stands, “the left would have a better chance of forming a majority”, concluded El Pais. “Of course, if the deadlock persists and the possibility of a repeat election begins to take shape, some unforeseen twist could arise.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/29/germanys-trump-country-why-small-towns-abandoned-mainstream-parties-far-right/715683001/", "title": "German election: Why small towns backed Alternative for Germany ...", "text": "Petra Sorge\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nDORFCHEMNITZ, Germany — Retired farmer Gerd Mazanec normally votes for one of Germany's mainstream parties. But in last Sunday's parliamentary elections, he cast his ballot for the far-right Alternative For Germany (AfD).\n\nMazanec's complaint: Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democrats and its government partners in Berlin aren't looking out for pensioners like him. Paying more than $3 for a beer on a pension of just $800 a month \"simply does not work,” groused Maznec, 62.\n\nNearly half the voters in this village of 1,500 also were discontented enough to vote for the AfD, helping it become the first far-right party to gain seats in the Bundestag since shortly after the Nazis were defeated in World War II.\n\nAfD finished first in the state of Saxony in eastern Germany, where Dorfchemnitz is located, a far better performance than its 12.6% national showing. Merkel won a fourth term but with a smaller bloc in the parliament.\n\nVillagers abandoned the mainstream parties for many of the same reasons rural Americans helped elected Donald Trump president in 2016. They feel ignored by the ruling elites, worry about a flood of immigrants changing the culture and character of their country, and are suffering tough economic times — or worry they will lose what they now have.\n\nDorfchemnitz is not one of the suffering communities. Its centuries-old woodcarving tradition has spawned a thriving cottage industry and unemployment is only 5.6%.\n\nMayor Thomas Schurig, a carpenter and locksmith who organizes dog sled races in the winter for tourists, said residents are angry about the lack of funds from the state government for local infrastructure, and the exodus of young people that is typical of villages across Germany.\n\nDorfchemnitz gets “nothing” from Saxony, Schurig complained.\n\nThat opened the door for appeals from AfD, which campaigned against the 1 million mostly Muslim migrants Merkel admitted since 2015 to provide a safe haven from war and poverty.\n\nDuring a visit here, AfD co-founder Frauke Petry called the tide of immigration a “crusade against our way of living.\"\n\n“(She) moved the hearts of the people here,” said Schurig.\n\nOne of those moved is retiree Ditmar Michler, 64, who says he voted for the AfD because of Merkel’s open-door policy for refugees. “I have a problem with that,” he said.\n\nThe new local AfD representative, Heiko Hessenkemper, a university professor from the nearby mining town Freiberg, promotes “Germany first,” Michler said approvingly.\n\nSuch attitudes worry local pastor Christine Klement, 33. “The result of the AfD is threatening,\" much like when Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party rose to power in the years preceding the start of World War II, she said. \"I wonder, when is the tipping point, when something like 1933 happens again.”\n\nMore:Germany's far-right AfD party gains seats in national parliament in major cultural shift\n\nMore:German election: Why Americans should care about a Merkel win\n\nMore:There is meddling in Germany's election — not by Russia, but by U.S. right wing", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/20/meddling-germany-election-not-russia-but-u-s-right-wing/676142001/", "title": "Germany election: U.S. right-wing voices meddling more than Russia", "text": "An alliance of mostly anonymous online trolls and extremist agitators meddled in Germany's election, but researchers said Russians mostly weren't to blame.\n\nInstead, they said, right-wing groups in the United States were behind materials popping up on YouTube, messaging board sites like 4chan and reddit and texting service Gab.ai.\n\nThe evidence came less than a week before Sunday's vote that handed German Chancellor Angela Merkel a fourth term.\n\nMore:Analysis: Merkel extends her reign as Europe's longest serving leader\n\n\"So far we have not been able to track down any specific Russian activity,\" said Simon Hegelich,\" a professor of political science data at the Technical University of Munich who has advised the German government about the threat of hacking and false information.\n\nMore:Trump is boosting Merkel's re-election campaign because he is so unpopular\n\nHegelich said proving connections among sympathizers is difficult and may never be conclusive.\n\nBut an analysis of 300 million tweets over the past six months by Hegelich and researchers at the Technical University of Munich shows Germany is a hotspot for posts that use the hashtag \"#AltRight.\"\n\n\"A lot of the stuff we are seeing in Germany can be linked to, or is at least inspired by, the 'alt-right' movement in the U.S.,\" Hegelich said, referring to a loosely defined group whose far-right ideology includes racism and white nationalism.\n\nMany denigrate both leading candidates — Merkel and her conservative Christian Democratic Union party, and her chief rival, Martin Schulz of the left-of-center Social Democratic Party — with the hashtags #Merkel and #Schulz.\n\nAnd many of those posts originate in the U.S., adding to the impression that right-wing social media users in both countries may be trying to sway German public opinion. It's possible that some of this alt-right messaging coming out of the U.S. may be connected to Russian interference; that, too, is difficult to determine, Hegelich said.\n\n(In the final hours before the election, after this story first published, researchers at the Digital Research Forensic Lab, part of the Atlantic Council think tank, said they had uncovered automated social media accounts linked to Russia. These accounts amplified right-wing messages in favor of the Alternative for Germany party (AfD), which won enough votes Sunday to enter Germany's national parliament for the first time.)\n\n\"There will never be an election again in which trolling, hacking and extreme far-right politics do not play a role,\" Andrew Auernheimer, a hacker and blogger for the U.S. neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website wrote after Donald Trump's election victory last year.\n\nThe Daily Stormer has been available intermittently since August after major technology firms including Google forced the site offline for comments about the death of Heather Heyer by an alt-right protester in Charlottesville, Va. Nevertheless, the website continues to publish commentaries about the German election.\n\n\"There is essentially no chance that the AfD can win this election,\" Adrian Sol wrote Sunday on the site, referring to Germany's anti-immigration and anti-European Union party.\n\n\"However, if they can keep putting pressure on the establishment and change the narrative, (there) may be hope yet that Germany can some day be saved.\"\n\nA report published Wednesday by Hope Not Hate, a British anti-racism watchdog, concluded that the alt-right movement has \"breathed life and youth back into formerly declining and dormant parts of the European extreme right.\"\n\nThe report, based on an undercover investigation of far-right figureheads, found that extremist individuals, organizations, websites and forums on both sides of the Atlantic are increasingly engaging with each another and \"weaponizing\" the Internet.\n\nSandro Gaycken, the founder and director of the Berlin-based Digital Society Institute, said right-wing voices tried to infiltrate conversations about the German election on Facebook and other social media platforms.\n\nOne example: Gaycken said for the past two months, new and existing Facebook users in Germany who searched for political discussion groups were automatically given recommendations that prioritized right-wing parties such as AfD.\n\n\"It's really strange because Facebook says this should be impossible because you are only supposed to get recommendations based on your own 'friends,' 'groups' and 'likes.' But everyone in Germany is getting these right-wing party recommendations,\" he said. \"Even left-wing journalists.\"\n\nFacebook said in a statement it was aware of the issue reported in Germany and that it was related to its \"Groups Discover\" feature. Facebook has now temporarily turned off the category \"news and politics\" in the \"Discover\" tab while it investigates the matter.\n\nFacebook said it was also examining the accounts of apparently non-existent users who purchased Facebook ads during the U.S. election. These accounts were subsequently linked to the pro-Kremlin troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency. Facebook said that it has not yet uncovered similar ad purchases related to the German vote.\n\n\"We haven't seen any trace of the Russians, just right-wingers,\" Gaycken added.\n\nMerkel's party won win 33% of the vote, well ahead of Schulz's SPD on 2.05%. AfD came in third, with 12.6%. Merkel could forge ahead with plans to pursue closer political and economic union with EU members, a policy as deeply unpopular with AfD's supporters as her decision to open Germany's borders to 1 million refugees since 2015.\n\nGermany's vulnerability to political hackers, Internet trolls and bots linked to Russia is hard to gauge. Plus, there may not be much point doing so, according to Mark Galeotti, who runs the Center for European Security, a research institute in Prague.\n\n\"There is no 'pro-Putin' candidate,\" he said.\n\n\"Any interference would be unlikely to have any substantive impact on the election result and only harden Germany's position against Moscow.\"\n\nMerkel has sought to blunt potential Russian interference through aggressive public information campaigns, by establishing additional cybersecurity agencies and strategies and by ushering in the Network Enforcement Act, a law that comes this October will fine social media companies up to $57 million if they do not remove hate speech, defamation and incitements to violence within 24 hours.\n\nGerman political parties also pledged not to use social bots in the election campaign, and independent media monitoring organizations such as Correctiv, which debunk false information and call out disinformation, have been established recently.\n\nThe government has insisted the software used to tabulate votes — paper ballots are hand-counted and then passed to regional authorities — is secure despite a study published Sept. 7 by the Chaos Computer Club, a German technology watchdog, showing the system's encryption method was outdated and vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nBut what may seem like a lack of interest from Moscow may be a sign of success.\n\n\"I think there is more Russian activity than meets the eye,\" said Joerg Forbrig, a Berlin-based political affairs expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a public policy think tank whose Alliance for Securing Democracy unit built an online tool that tracks Russian propaganda and disinformation efforts. Its \"Hamilton 68\" dashboard analyzes about 600 Twitter accounts directly controlled by Russia, by users who promote Russian themes, and by users and topics Russia seeks to discredit or attack.\n\n\"In the past we have seen a very systematic and skilled outreach program into Germany's Russian-speaking population. This was first tested in state elections in Berlin last September. In those areas where there are very high numbers of Russian speakers living in Berlin, the AfD's vote share was up to 35%,\" Forbrig said.\n\nHe said these campaigns involved circulating posters and leaflets with messages that were inimical to the German government's position on Russian sanctions or NATO.\n\nForbrig said there could be forms of Russian support for the AfD not yet recognized.\n\nThe Alliance for Securing Democracy has concluded that Russia has meddled in the affairs of at least 27 European and North American countries since 2004 with interference that ranges from cyberattacks to disinformation campaigns.\n\nIn 2015, a Russian-intelligence-linked hacking group called Fancy Bear stole data from German parliamentarians, including Merkel. This data has yet to be released to the public. Fancy Bear is the same group thought to be behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee in the run up to the U.S. election. Moscow repeatedly has dismissed allegations it intervenes in elections as anti-Russian propaganda.\n\nMore:Alleged Russian political meddling documented in 27 countries since 2004\n\nStill, Forbrig added the German election may be less susceptible to outside influence for three reasons: Voters watched alleged Russian meddling take place in the U.S. and French elections, which has led to high levels of awareness; Germany's multi-party electoral system makes it more difficult to predict how messages and information targeted at one group might impact others; and Germany's media is, Forbrig said, generally more \"balanced and calm\" and lacks \"shrill voices\" compared to its counterparts elsewhere. Further, its media is still viewed as a trusted source of information — not always the case in President Trump's Washington.\n\n\"If the Russians have any juicy information obtained on Merkel or anyone else they probably would have dumped it by now,\" said Melissa Hooper, an expert on legal and civil society issues related to former Soviet Union countries.\n\nHooper has followed Russia's attempts to use Kremlin-backed NGOs, think tanks and public policy foundations to influence the outcome of the German election. Additionally, she is trying to determine if there is any crossover between what these institutions are saying about the German election and messaging coming from right-wing groups.\n\n\"On a lot of issues you see similarities, and they are what you would expect: the functioning of the EU; democracy and whether it's serving everyone or really the provenance of elites; it's about NATO and issues of migration,\" she said.\n\nHooper added: \"I have not seen any gotcha moment yet.\"\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/24/germany-afd-gains-seats-national-parliament/698039001/", "title": "Germany's far-right AfD party wins seats in national parliament.", "text": "Jabeen Bhatti\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nBERLIN — In a seismic cultural shift, German voters on Sunday elected members of a far-right, nationalist party into parliament for the first time in a half-century.\n\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD), In its first federal election, was headed toward winning about 88 seats in the current 630-member Bundestag and making it the third-largest political force in parliament.\n\n\"We're going chase down Frau Merkel (Chancellor Angela Merkel) and whoever else gets in our way until we get back our country,\" AfD co-founder and co-chairman Alexander Gauland said shortly after exit polls were released when voting ended.\n\nThe victory by Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union party was no surprise Sunday. But her open-door policy that allowed refugees into the country since 2015 spiked support for the AfD and propelled the party into parliament.\n\nThe AfD is the first far-right party in the national parliament since the German Right Party won seats in 1949 for one term.\n\nThe party's staunch anti-Islamic rhetoric appealed to pockets of voters who feared that an influx of Muslim refugees could shake the foundation of German society.\n\n\"I think that Merkel broke European laws by allowing over 1 million mostly young and male Muslims into a country that's supposed to have a German culture,\" said Christian Schulz, 41, a Berlin real estate agent and former supporter of Merkel's conservative party. \"That was absolute madness. The AfD is the only party in Germany that's against mass Islamic immigration.\"\n\nThe AfD was founded in 2013 as a party against Germany's use of the 19-nation euro currency rather than the mark and the country's actions in bailing out Greece during the euro crisis. But the party quickly shifted to a nationalist, anti-immigration platform after Merkel's open-door policy was announced.\n\nMany voters said Sunday they were voting mainly to keep the AfD out of parliament because they view the party as reactionary and hope its prominence is short-lived.\n\n\"That party is completely brutal. Their rhetoric and everything they stand for is so unkind,\" said Linn Nguyan, 24, a business student in Berlin. \"I hope the era of the AfD won't last long.\"\n\nAnalysts say the AfD's success from angry, disaffected voters worried about immigration is the same phenomenon that propelled last year's Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom, the French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen to the second round of France's presidential election this spring and Donald Trump's White House victory last November.\n\nIn Germany, which has seen less populism than its neighbors over the past decades because of its Nazi legacy from World War II, nationalism is once again accepted as the country moves on.\n\n\"For all its resistance to change, why should Germany be any different than anywhere else in Europe,\" said Jackson Janes, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at the Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. \"The AfD entering the Bundestag is a reflection of a changing society.\"\n\nThe AfD currently has seats in 13 of Germany's 16 regional parliaments. Analysts say even with seats in the national parliament, the party won't really impact policy because every other party has refused to work with it.\n\nBut the AfD's impact is that it will now have a national platform.\n\n\"The AfD will try to sell their political message,\" said Florian Hartleb, a political analyst and expert on right-wing extremism in Berlin. \"The AfD will enter parliament, and there will be new debates about what that means for the future of the federal republic.\"\n\nThat could also backfire. \"Their primary political figures may look good to their constituents now, but they won't look good once they become part of system,\" said Josef Janning, who heads the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nMore:Analysis: Merkel the survivor extends her reign as Europe's longest serving leader\n\nMore:Germans hand Chancellor Angela Merkel a historic fourth term; challenger Schulz concedes\n\nMore:There is meddling in Germany's election — not by Russia, but by U.S. right wing\n\nMore:German election: Why Americans should care about a Merkel win", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2024/09/05/german-far-right-party-fears-nazi-germany/75054309007/", "title": "No place for Nazis: German far-right party win signals scary reality", "text": "Khue Pham\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe man in the video is standing in the eastern German city of Leipzig, cigarette in his left hand.

In Saxony, home of the city of Leipzig, it came in a close second after the conservative Christian Democratic Union.\n\nI knew from the polls that this could happen, but it still felt like a punch in the stomach when I saw the numbers.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nRise of the AfD brings back an old fear\n\nThis is the country that put Hitler in power, started World War II in the name of “racial supremacy” and killed more than 6 million Jews. This is the country that vowed to “never again” fall into the traps of fascism.\n\nWhy did you not learn from your past?, I wanted to ask the AfD voters who have elevated it to become the dominant political force in eastern Germany ‒ though its immigrant population is only 11.4%, much less than in western Germany, where the immigrant share is 32.9%.\n\nThe surge of the AfD is sometimes compared to the rise of Trumpism in the United States, the Brexit movement in the United Kingdom or Marine Le Pen's far-right success in France. But even Le Pen considered the AfD too extremist to work with in European Parliament.\n\nNews reports have found that some AfD politicians employ people from the neo-Nazi spectrum while others have committed crimes. One former lawmaker is facing a lengthy trial on terrorism charges.\n\nHamas murders more hostages:Have we learned anything from history about how antisemitism infects and spreads?\n\nI have no doubt that the majority of Germans reject AfD's anti-immigrant, revisionist ideology. Earlier this year, more than a million people took to the street to protest against it. At the European Union election this June in Germany, AfD \"only“ gained 15.9% of the vote.\n\nIn the aftermath of the state elections Sunday, other parties have committed to a firewall of noncooperation with the AfD and are scrambling for ways to form governing coalitions without it.\n\nEven so, to second-generation immigrants like me, the rise of the AfD brings back an old fear: How dangerous is the threat of racism?\n\n'No go areas' can return in a heartbeat\n\nBorn to Vietnamese parents, who had left their home during the war, I grew up in a sleepy suburb of West Berlin. When I was a girl, people could not understand that I was both Asian and German. Time and again, strangers would ask me where I was from. \"From Berlin,“ I'd reply. “You don't get it,” they'd say. “Where are you really from?”\n\nThese were the 1990s, the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Collective euphoria over reunification had given way to national volatility as the socialism of East Germany was replaced by Western capitalism.\n\nMass unemployment in the former GDR made many feel like second-class citizens in a country they no longer understood.\n\nThe tensions erupted into a string of racist riots. In Rostock in 1992, hundreds of neo-Nazis besieged a tower block housing mainly Vietnamese contract workers. After throwing rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails for several days, they set the building on fire ‒ while neighbors cheered on and the police retreated in fear.\n\nWhat 'plague of migrant crime'?Decades of criminal justice research debunk fearmongering.\n\nIn my family, we called places like this “no go areas.” They were scattered throughout the former East Germany (and some parts of the former West Germany) and ruled by right-wing youth gangs who shaved their heads and wore black clothes.\n\nAs the violence subsided, I banished them from my mind. Sure, there were still some racist pockets and groups, but the majority of Germans seemed to finally embrace cultural diversity and a much more inclusive understanding of what it means to be German today.\n\nAccording to the 2023 microcensus, a third of the German population, almost 25 million people, are immigrants or their descendants, like me.\n\nWatching the video of the neo-Nazis in Leipzig made me realize that the \"no go areas” can return in a heartbeat, and perhaps they were never truly gone.\n\nEmboldened by the success of the AfD, the far right is trying to cross from the fringes into the mainstream.

German right-wing party to be first in parliament since ...", "text": "The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is running third in Sunday's national election, with as much as 12% of the vote German polls show. That finish would mark a milestone: AfD would be the first far-right nationalist party to enter Germany's parliament since the defeat of the Nazis in World War II.\n\nAll the mainstream parties in Germany have ruled out allowing AfD to be part of any coalition government — necessary under the German system because there are so many political parties. But if it does as well as forecast, AfD would emerge as the chief opposition in the parliament, or Bundestag, to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who appears headed for an easy victory to a fourth term.\n\nHere's what AfD wants to see happen in Europe's largest economy.\n\nAnti-immigration\n\nAfD has been campaigning with the anti-Muslim slogan, \"Burkas? We’d prefer bikinis.\" The party gained in popularity following Merkel's decision to allow 1 million refugees to enter Germany since 2015, most of them Muslims fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. AfD wants to institute identity checks and seal Germany's borders.\n\nMore:Why is Merkel headed for a fourth term? It's the German economy, stupid!\n\nIt hates the EU\n\nAfD was founded in 2013, chiefly as a party opposed to the European Union. In particular, it was opposed to what it assailed as an endless flow of German taxpayer money to bail out indebted southern EU nations such as Greece and Portugal. It also opposes Germany's use of the 19-nation euro currency rather than the mark. And it opposes further EU political and economic integration as a weakening of German sovereignty even though the country is the most influential member of the EU.\n\nMore:Trump boosting Merkel's re-election campaign because he's so unpopular\n\nDefender of conservative values\n\nAfD opposes what it sees as corrosive liberal values sweeping the nation. For example, it views marriage between a man and woman as \"life's primary purpose,\" according to a curriculum on sex education it has proposed. The party believes information on homosexual, bisexual and transgender people should be restricted. It does not believe homosexual and lesbian couples should be allowed to adopt kids. Merkel's Christian Democrats also tend to be conservative on social issues, but earlier this year, Merkel allowed a vote in parliament that made gay marriage legal. She voted \"no\" to appease her base.\n\nA voice for Russia?\n\nBetween 2 million and 3 million Russian speakers live in Germany and the AfD has courted their votes. Ahead of Sunday's election, the German government feared Moscow would try to intervene — as it allegedly did in the 2016 U.S. presidential election — by backing the AfD with money or anti-EU and anti-NATO propaganda. So far, there is no evidence of that, although right-wing groups from the U.S. have meddled, according to German researchers.\n\nMore:There is meddling in German election — not by Russia, but U.S. right wing", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2025/02/27/german-election-musk-vance-endorse-afd-far-right/80295322007/", "title": "Does my country want me? Germany's historic far-right election gain ...", "text": "Khue Pham\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nBERLIN — After our federal election Sunday, I looked at a map of Germany, its tree-shaped silhouette colored according to the winners of each constituency, and I worried about our future.\n\nThe Western part was largely shaded in the black of the conservatives, whose 69-year old leader Friedrich Merz won the election with 28.5% of the vote by campaigning on more deportations, less taxes and a “spiritual and moral turnaround\" to \"German values” like punctuality, hard work and a mandatory year of social service for young people.\n\nEastern Germany, in contrast, was a sea blue, the color of the far-right Alternative for Germany. Except for Berlin, the leftist capital. Represented by Alice Weidel, a 46-year old gay woman married to a woman born in Sri Lanka, AfD has doubled its share to 20.8% by campaigning for a massive deportation offensive, the restoration of the Deutsche mark and, somewhat paradoxically, the ideal of the traditional family model of man, woman and children.\n\nShunned by liberal Germans, AfD has become the second strongest party in the country and, arguably, the driving force behind a national debate obsessed with immigration. This is the party favored by President Donald Trump's inner circle and endorsed by Vice President JD Vance and adviser Elon Musk.\n\nMusk calls far-right AfD the 'last spark of hope' for Germany\n\nMuch like MAGA, the AfD counts white supremacists, conspiracy theorists and Holocaust deniers among its ranks. But neither scandals nor court convictions leave a dent on its popularity.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn an interview with Musk, who called the AfD the “last spark of hope\" for Germany, Weidel claimed that Adolf Hitler was a “communist.”\n\nAnother time, she echoed the Trump administration's stance in saying that Russia has been blamed for the war in Ukraine “far too one-sidedly.”\n\nOpinion:Trump's mishandling of Ukraine hurts our allies – and empowers our enemies\n\nTo many Germans, the seemingly unstoppable rise of the AfD is an existential threat that is far from over. It seems to be only a matter of time until the blue parts spill over into the black ones. Weidel and her co-leader Tino Chrupalla are already eyeing Germany's next federal elections in four years, boasting that they will become the biggest party by then.\n\nWhat kind of future does Germany have in store for my family?\n\nBorn in 1982 in West Berlin to Vietnamese parents, I grew up in the '90s, the period after German reunification. As collective euphoria gave way to national volatility, an ugly asylum debate swept the country, creating a climate of mistrust against anyone who looked or sounded different.\n\nBack then, people called me an \"Ausländer,\" a foreigner, even though I was born in this country. And even though I had a German passport and spoke German perfectly, I grew up with the sense of not really belonging here.\n\nIt was only much later that I read about the racist attacks that had taken place during those years. Mölln, 1992: three members of Turkish family dead. Solingen, 1993: five members of a Turkish family dead. Rostock, 1992, hundreds of neo-Nazis besieged and attacked a tower block housing mainly Vietnamese contract workers over several days.\n\nVance scolds German leaders for political 'firewall,' meets with AfD leader\n\nConservative leader Friedrich Merz, who first entered German parliament in 1994, is very much a man of that era. Will we return to the past as he moves into the chancellery and seeks to undo Angela Merkel's “welcome culture”?\n\nAccording to Merz, it was a breach of law that the former chancellor let in a million refugees in 2015, most of them fleeing the war in Syria. In his vision, Germany's “leading culture” should replace multiculturalism: “This includes buying a Christmas tree before Christmas. It is part of our Western Christian-influenced identity.”\n\nOpinion:In halting Trump ban on DEI, judge sides with patriotism for America\n\nIn his pursuit of overhauling Germany's stance toward immigration, Merz recently broke a political taboo by holding a symbolic parliamentary vote backed by the AfD. Tens of thousands of Germans took to the streets to protest, fearing that a conservative-led government could open to the door to a power-sharing agreement with the far right.\n\nThe conservative leader argued that he had been driven to do so after a horrific knife attack in Bavaria last month: A former Afghan asylum seeker had killed a 2-year-old-boy and a man who tried to stop him.\n\nMerz has since stressed repeatedly that he will never work with the AfD. But some of his colleagues in eastern Germany have started to argue publicly that it will be impossible to uphold.\n\nAt this month's international security conference in Munich, the U.S. vice president echoed this thinking, arguing that shutting out populist parties with a political “firewall” was undemocratic. Vance also met with AfD's Weidel, who praised him for an “excellent speech.”\n\nMerz will now try to form a grand coalition with the ruling Social Democrats, who suffered a historic defeat and shrank to 16.4%. Will they manage to find a compromise on migration, lift up Germany's shrinking economy and turn the tide of populism? Or will they get washed away like so many other governments did?\n\nWe saw it happen in the United States, where the Republicans transformed into the party of Trump. We saw it in the United Kingdom, where the Tories held the Brexit vote that ended up wrecking five of their conservative prime ministers. Far-right parties have also become dominant in other European countries, such as Austria and France.\n\nGermany, however, is the country that put Hitler in power, started World War II in the name of “racial supremacy” and killed 6 million Jews. This is the country that vowed to “never again” fall into the traps of fascism.\n\nAmerican historian Timothy Snyder recently said, \"Germany is now the most important democracy.\" As President Trump is remaking the world in a blitzkrieg of executive actions, my home country will have to step into a new leadership role.\n\nThirty-five years after reunification, German is at a crossroads again. Let's hope that it will take the right way forward.\n\nKhue Pham is a German journalist and writer.

We had to get Metro’s budget under control by living within our means, and departments throughout Metro stepped up and did just that.\"\n\n\"Our plan worked,\" he said, announcing he will submit to the Metro Council this week a $2.33 billion budget for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nKicked off by the White's Creek High School concert choir and the city's youth poet laureate Mumina Ali, Briley spoke to an overflow crowd of city boosters, Metro Council members, city employees and stakeholders that included some of his challengers in the August mayoral election.\n\nBut his speech in its entirety was light on specifics, with the mayor instead using his most visible platform of the year to outline his administration’s successes.\n\n\"This is not going to be a speech about promises,\" Briley said at the outset of his remarks. \"This will be a speech about progress.\"\n\nFULL SPEECH:Read Nashville Mayor David Briley's State of Metro address\n\nHe hailed Nashville as a \"growing city,\" touting the more than 8,600 jobs that \"four leading companies\" are bringing here — stopping short of naming Amazon, which will bring its new operations hub downtown.\n\nMetro Council approved a $17.5 million incentive package last month to the tech giant, a divisive move with many concerned about what it would mean for the city's growing affordable housing crisis and residents who feel left behind.\n\nIt's the same reason the removal of cherry trees for the recent NFL Draft became symbolic of how many feel that their place in city has been uprooted as Nashville continues to grow.\n\n\"When we prosper as a city, we can do more for the people who live here. It’s simple — prosperity gives us more resources to build a stronger Nashville,\" Briley said.\n\n\"As our skyline continues to grow, we have to do everything we can to put our people in a position to grow along with it.\" Briley said. \"That is my top priority.\"\n\nRaises for city employees\n\nFaced with a $34 million revenue shortfall that he inherited, Briley's $2.23 billion budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year meant only a $5 million budget increase to Nashville schools and walking back on a promise for a cost-of-living pay increases to Metro employees.\n\nThe budget this year, Briley said, will deliver on the 3% raise for Metro's police, firefighters and other employees.\n\nHe said he will also propose that the starting pay for police officers be increased by 6.4% and that all full-time employees in the city's general pay plan make at least $15 per hour. This does not apply to Metro school employees.\n\nBut like his announcement of the pay increase in March, Briley provided no detail on how it is being accomplished and how the city would pay for it.\n\nOn the topic of police, Briley touted Nashville's success in hosting the NFL Draft over the weekend with few safety issues.\n\nNashville set new records for television and streaming viewership and live attendance for the NFL Draft, with a combined 47.5 million viewers and a combined 600,000 people attending events downtown.\n\n\"I want to thank all the people who made that possible,\" Briley said, saying Metro employees played starring roles. \"It was a weekend of sports, music and Nashville’s famous hospitality that showed our city off to the world in a wonderful light.\"\n\nBriley also cited the launch of Project Safe Nashville in January, an interagency effort to track guns used in crimes, as well as a $100,000 allocation in his budget to the Sexual Assault Center, a Nashville nonprofit that opened its new Safe Clinic last fall.\n\nEducation priority No. 1\n\nBut one of Briley's biggest tests could be in education, where he has vowed to take a leading role in the future of the city's school system.\n\nA turbulent year for Metro Nashville Public Schools ended with the school board agreeing to part ways with former Director of Schools Shawn Joseph.\n\nIt came after a year of questioning from two board members over Joseph's management. But while Joseph's tenure ultimately split the board, it has rallied behind the recently appointed interim Director Adrienne Battle.\n\nBriley voiced his support Tuesday for the district's new chief, a graduate of the Nashville school system.\n\n\"Dr. Battle is a testament to what Metro Schools can do,\" he said, calling her job the toughest in the city. \"I hope you know we’re all rooting for you, and we stand ready to help.\"\n\nMEET THE NEW SCHOOLS CHIEF: How Adrienne Battle plans to lead Nashville schools\n\nBriley alluded to a memorandum of understanding he will establish with MNPS, which he first announced in late March when he vowed to take on a stronger role in the district's finances, operations and human resources.\n\nDuring his budget talks with MNPS earlier this month — when Battle presented a proposed a $963 million operating budget for the upcoming fiscal year, a $76.7 million increase over last year — Briley said his budget for the district would exceed $1 billion for the first time.\n\nHe provided no additional insight Tuesday on the figure that would also cover capital expenditures and estimated debt payments on top of operating costs.\n\nIt would, however, allow the district to give all teachers and support staff a 3% raise, the mayor said.\n\n\"I recognize there is a growing sense that teachers should get a much larger raise and that Metro Schools should get a much larger budget increase,\" Briley said.\n\nThe mayor also touted the Nashville GRAD program — which stands for Getting Results by Advancing Degrees — aimed at helping students who have lived in the city in the past year enroll at Nashville State Community College and TCAT Nashville.\n\nBriley will put $1 million toward the city-funded effort for the upcoming school year to help freshman students with, on average, a $1,500-a-year scholarships for expenses such as books, supplies, exams, food and transportation.\n\n\"Nashville GRAD will put students on a pathway to prosperity. When we can make that happen by investing $1,000 or $2,000 in a teenager’s future, that’s a very smart investment for our city,\" Briley said.\n\nELECTION:Mayoral candidates say Nashville Mayor David Briley's State of Metro address lacks details, 'skirts' key issues\n\nCall from Elizabeth Warren on housing initiative\n\nBriley said the the city has made vast strides in addressing it's affordable housing crisis, specifically mentioning his \"innovative\" Under One Roof 2029 initiative.\n\nThe city will invest $500 million over 10 years to help create at least 10,000 units, mainly by funding the Metropolitan Development and Housing Authority.\n\n\"We’re making an investment in affordable housing unlike any we’ve ever seen,\" Briley said, adding that presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren congratulated him in a voicemail, praising the city for its \"bold\" initiative.\n\nBut his mayoral challengers and others have criticized Briley's plan as \"falling short\" and as a bad investment of public money to fund projects MDHA has struggled to complete on its own.\n\nThe mayor said Metro will announce later in the day $9.8 million in grants from the Barnes Fund for Affordable Housing to nonprofit developers to build and preserve more affordable units.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is helping Nashville build more units, specifically for those with extremely low incomes, he said.\n\n\"This approach is going to stand out among our peers across the United States,\" Briley said. \"But we have more to do.\"\n\nTransit still priority; push for private parking deal\n\nBriley's speech last year came at the heels of Nashvillians' decisive vote rejecting a historic referendum to raise four taxes to pay for a new $5.4 billion transit system. It was a proposal put together by former Mayor Megan Barry that Briley once put his political capital on the line to support.\n\nFollowing the transit loss, Briley had said \"doing nothing is not an option,\" adding that any successful plan would require city dollars, sacrifice and collaborations among those who might be at odds.\n\nHe has since said he would not pursue another public referendum on funding transit over the next four years if he is reelected in August.\n\nBut Briley assured residents that transit remains a \"major priority\" and that Nashville can't miss the opportunity to \"have done something.\"\n\n\"What we need to do now is get something on the ground to show how effective transit can be, and a great place to start is Dickerson Road,\" he said, saying the city has a willing partner in the Tennessee Department of Transportation. He said the city also is exploring transit along the corridor to Vietnam Veterans Parkway.\n\n\"And we have an opportunity, for once, to get the infrastructure in place before the waves of development roll in,\" Briley said.\n\nThe mayor next brought up Nashville's deal to hand over the city's on-street parking management to a private company. The 30-year agreement means more than $300 million for the city.\n\nThe money, he announced Tuesday, will go directly back into \"transit-related improvements\" such as Vision Zero projects, which aims to achieve no fatalities or serious injuries involving road traffic.\n\n\"We stay in complete control, and everyone wins — except for the guy who likes to leave his car at a meter all day without paying,\" he said.\n\nBriley also said debt service will be a priority with a 15 percent increase in the funds that will go toward retiring Metro’s debt.\n\nAlso in his speech, Briley highlighted:\n\nGreer Stadium is coming down.\n\nNational Museum of African American Music going up (which he mentioned to Jay-Z in a casual conversation when he performed at Vanderbilt last summer).\n\nBudget including $442,000 to implement Metro's Equal Business Opportunity Program starting July 1.\n\nNashville becoming the first city in the South to recognize LGBT-owned businesses in its procurement process.\n\nThe more than 5,000 trees planted as part of the Root Nashville campaign that looks to plant half a million trees across the city by the year 2050.\n\nCreating two full-time inspectors to the Codes Department who will focus exclusively on short-term rentals, funded by raising the fee for rental permits.\n\nYihyun Jeong covers politics in Nashville for USA TODAY Network - Tennessee.

Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States government is pulling out all the stops to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, injecting billions of dollars into the beleaguered sector and flexing all policy muscles available to give it a leg up over competition from Asia.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, firms initially curtailed orders for these micro building blocks needed for smartphones, computers, cars and many other products. Then, as people began working from home, demand soared for information and communication technology – and the chips that power them. A chip shortage ensued, and auto plants had to stop production because they could not obtain chips. This contributed to skyrocketing new and used vehicle prices, a major driver of the painful inflation Americans were feeling.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dubbed the semiconductor shortage a “national security” issue because it exposed the dependency of US manufacturing on imports of semiconductors from abroad. Chips also serve critical military applications and are necessary for cybersecurity tools.\n\nThe Biden administration and lawmakers rallied in response, passing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. The legislation includes $52 billion to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Of this, $39 billion is earmarked for manufacturing incentives, $13.2 billion for research and development and workforce training, and $500 million for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, several prominent companies have announced significant investments in US manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a powerhouse in the industry committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024. At the start of the year, Intel said it planned to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio, and groundbreaking for the new chip plant took place just last month. And this month, Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York.\n\nIn a flurry of tweets earlier this month President Joe Biden pledged: “America is going to lead the way in microchip manufacturing.”\n\nBut the US has much catching up to do. US-based fabs, or chip manufacturing plants, currently only account for 12% of the world’s modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group. Some 75% of the world’s modern chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia – a majority of that in geopolitically-vulnerable Taiwan. And even with these renewed efforts, the United States does not currently have the same talent and supply chain pipeline as some Asian markets do to support a robust homegrown industry.\n\nA chip by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 26, 2020. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo complicate matters, the surge in public and private investments comes at a questionable time, as concerns over the global chip supply shortage have eased. Pandemic-related supply chain blockages are letting up somewhat and a worsening economic outlook has hampered demand.\n\nIn an earnings call last week, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei warned it expects the “semiconductor industry will likely decline” in 2023. “TSMC also is not immune,” Wei added, but said it expects “to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.”\n\nPromoting semiconductor manufacturing in the United States now may risk leading to overcapacity and excess supply. And with demand weakening, it isn’t immediately clear if government subsidies will be enough to overcome other obstacles the country faces in developing a competitive semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nUnderstanding the US problems\n\nTo understand the latest US efforts, it’s important to be clear on where the country stands – not just in the overall chip industry, but in relation to specific, valuable pockets of it.\n\n“The US is very unlikely to increase its share of global production because even as the US brings online more fab capacity; TSMC, Intel and others are announcing fabs in other places and building them even more quickly,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“But I don’t necessarily think that’s really a huge problem,” he added. He noted that measuring manufacturing based on pure output lumps together the lower-end chips and the cutting-edge, higher-end chips that are a more realistic and significant measure of chip manufacturing success. “The US does need to expand chip production for a specific kind of chips, that are directly related to American national security,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration last Friday imposed sweeping new export curbs designed to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors made with US equipment, in a move that targets the manufacturing of advanced weapons systems.\n\nWhile only “about 10% to 14% of chips sold [globally] come from US manufacturing facilities,” according to Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang, the United States does have other strengths. “In terms of design expertise, a lot of that still resides in the U.S.”\n\nTechnicians inspect a piece of equipment during a tour of the Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant Feb. 11, 2022, in Manassas, Va. Steve Helber/AP\n\nStill, the shortcomings are real. “When it comes to foundries, which are the manufacturing side of semiconductors, the U.S. has not really been a major player for many, many years,” said Wang. While it very much used to be, manufacturing began migrating to Asia during the 1980s and ’90s, Wang said. “One of the big reasons for this is that the cost of labor is lower, and it’s just far cheaper to produce at a very massive scale, integrated circuits and chips, in those parts of the world,” Wang added. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, said that it costs 50% more to manufacture chips in the U.S. than in Taiwan.\n\nNow, simply having the facilities already set up to produce or expand chip manufacturing gives Asia a big advantage. Wang said he thinks that might be why you see the U.S. “axe-throwing so much money at companies to set up plants in the United States.” It’s not just to respond to demand and become more self-reliant, “but also because you need to get these things up and running very, very quickly, in order to even be in the race at all.”\n\nWhat it takes to build up a domestic chip industry\n\nBuilding new chip fabs itself is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. “A modern fab is something like half a million square feet,” said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner, and requires “monstrous clean rooms that have massive air handling capabilities.” He added that these massive buildings require “exceptionally strong foundations.” As he put it, “you cannot have any vibration in the fab because it can wreck the manufacturing process.”\n\nIn addition, a single extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, required to map out the circuitry of chips, costs about $150 million, and Reuters reports “a cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines.”\n\nMoreover, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires a range of specialized inputs, including pure chemicals such as fluorinated polyimide, and etching gas, chip etching machines, and more. In places like Taiwan and Fukuoka, Japan, supply chains have developed where the providers of these products are located close to the semiconductor factories. There are also one or two companies that produce vital inputs and that have been trustworthy suppliers to companies in Asia for a long time. This is not yet the case in places like Arizona and Ohio, where plans to build massive chip manufacturing plants are already underway.\n\nYou also need a labor force willing and able to do the work.\n\nIn the United States, there is both a shortage of new graduates and experienced workers with the technical and engineering knowledge necessary to manufacture semiconductors. Many of those who might have the right experience instead prefer to work in trendier industries, according to Kennedy.\n\n“If we were to today, snap our fingers and have ten new fabs with the world’s leading chips, we probably wouldn’t have enough people to staff them,” Kennedy said. “That’s the biggest bottleneck to the expansion of America’s fab capacity, not capital.”\n\nIntel has tried to establish close relations with Arizona State University to recruit engineers, but it is unclear whether it and other companies building fabs in America will be able to hire enough trained engineers and technicians. If not, even the billions of dollars committed by the private and public sector may not be enough to reshore semiconductor manufacturing.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/tech/amazon-one-medical/index.html", "title": "Amazon to buy One Medical for $3.9 billion as it expands healthcare ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmazon (AMZN) on Thursday said it has entered an agreement to acquire primary healthcare company One Medical in an all-cash deal valued at approximately $3.9 billion.\n\nOne Medical is a membership-based primary care service that promises customers “24/7 access to virtual care.” The company operates in a dozen major US markets, according to its website, and works with over 8,000 companies to offer One Medical health benefits to their employees.\n\nIn a statement Thursday announcing the acquisition, Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, said the e-commerce giant thinks “health care is high on the list of experiences that need reinvention.” Lindsay added that Amazon hopes to be one of the companies “that helps dramatically improve the healthcare experience over the next several years.”\n\nThe acquisition is just the latest example of the tech giant expanding its footprint in the healthcare industry. Amazon acquired PillPack, an online pharmacy, in 2018 and later launched its own digital pharmacy in the United States. Separately, Amazon partnered with JP Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on an effort to provide better health care services and insurance at a lower cost to workers and families at the three companies, and possibly other businesses, too. That effort, called Haven, shut down last year.\n\nAmazon in recent years has broadened its empire from online retail to entertainment, groceries and more, increasing its vast reach into the lives of consumers in the process. The One Medical acquisition would be one of the largest in Amazon’s history. Amazon agreed to buy grocery chain Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion and earlier this year closed an $8.5 billion deal to buy iconic Hollywood movie studio MGM.\n\nWith the One Medical deal, Amazon would gain access to physical health clinics and “payer and hospital system relationships,” Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson said in a note Thursday morning.\n\nHeadquartered in San Francisco, One Medical has seen demand for its services surge in recent years amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of the telehealth sector. In its most-recent quarterly earnings report, One Medical said it had a total membership count of 767,000, up 28% year-over-year. One Medical went public in January 2020.\n\nShares for 1life Healthcare (ONEM), the parent company of One Medical, surged more than 65% in early trading Thursday after the announcement. Amazon stock opened the relatively flat Thursday. (Shares for CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance dipped slightly Thursday morning following the news.)\n\nThe deal remains subject to approval from One Medical’s shareholders and regulators.\n\nNicholas Economides, a professor of economics at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said he is skeptical the deal may trigger much formal antitrust scrutiny. He compared the One Medical acquisition to Amazon’s earlier purchase of Whole Foods, saying that Amazon’s preexisting marketshare in both industries was rather small at the time of the respective deals. Traditionally, antitrust regulators have closely scrutinized mergers that might eliminate a competitor from within the same market, but have rarely objected to deals where one company acquires its way into an adjacent industry.\n\n“The grounds for intervention are even weaker in this case than in Whole Foods, because to some extent Amazon is a marketplace for selling food, so to a small extent it was a competitor to Whole Foods before the merger,” Economides said. “Here, I don’t see Amazon having a significant business in healthcare.”\n\nBut some were quick to call for more scrutiny of the deal. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said the Federal Trade Commission must “thoroughly investigate” the proposed acquisition. The e-commerce giant’s bid “raises questions about potential anticompetitive effects” Amazon could exert through its pharmacy service, Klobuchar wrote to FTC Chair Lina Khan on Thursday.\n\nAlthough Amazon’s latest deal may not raise red flags under a traditional antitrust rubric, the announcement comes as officials at the FTC, the Justice Department and in Congress have sounded a tougher note on large tech platforms and vowed to get more creative — and aggressive — about enforcing competition law. Some US lawmakers are urgently pushing to pass a bill that could erect new barriers between tech giants’ various lines of business, preventing them from using their massive scale in multiple verticals as a kind of force multiplier that critics say harms competition.\n\nShortly after the deal was announced, some tech industry critics also raised concerns about the health data to which the company could gain access.\n\n“Amazon having back door access to private health care data is frankly a terrifying thought and calls into focus how desperately Congress needs to pass antitrust reform to prevent these tech giants from abusing their monopoly power,” Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project advocacy group, told CNN Business in a statement.\n\nCNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2024/10/30/reuters-special-report-inside-intels-18a-chip-process-delays/75928072007/", "title": "Reuters special report Inside Intel's 18A chip process delays", "text": "Max A. Cherney, Jeffrey Dastin, Dawn Chmielewski, Fanny Potkin and Stephen Nellis\n\nReuters\n\n(Reuters) - Pat Gelsinger took the reins as Intel CEO three years ago with hopes of reviving the American industrial icon. He soon made a big mistake.\n\nIntel had a sweet deal going with Taiwan’s TSMC, the giant manufacturer of semiconductors for other companies. TSMC would make chips that Intel designed but could not produce. And it was offering deep discounts to Intel, say four people with knowledge of the agreement.\n\nIntel's Ohio project:Intel's $28 billion New Albany project faces more delays as company awaits federal funding\n\nInstead of nurturing the relationship, Gelsinger – who hopes to restore Intel’s own manufacturing prowess – offended TSMC by calling out Taiwan’s precarious relations with China. “You don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab,” he said in May 2021, using industry jargon for a chip fabrication plant. That December, encouraging U.S. investment in U.S. chipmakers, he said at a tech conference: “Taiwan is not a stable place.”\n\nIn public, TSMC downplayed the comments, with its founder calling Gelsinger “a bit rude.” Privately, TSMC said it would no longer honor the discount, the sources said: about 40% off the $23,000, 3-nanometer wafers on which TSMC would print chips for Intel. Intel had to pay full price, shrinking its profit margin on the deal.\n\nAsked about the previously unreported episode, Intel said TSMC is an important partner with which it has a “healthybusiness relationship today.” TSMC told Reuters Intel is an important customer.\n\nGelsinger’s affront to Taiwan was part of a series of missteps during his time as Intel CEO. He inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. But Gelsinger compounded those problems.\n\nThis account of his rocky tenure is based on interviews with about four dozen current and former Intel employees and executives, as well as internal company videos, supplier documents and regulatory records.\n\nGelsinger set sky-high expectations for Intel’s manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or canceling contracts or unable to deliver the promised products. He issued optimistic public projections for AI-chip deals that were far higher than Intel’s own internal sales forecasts, company insiders say.\n\nAnd like TSMC, Gelsinger sought to transform Intel into a \"foundry,\" an operation that makes chips designed by other companies. But Intel’s efforts to regain manufacturing leadership with a chip-production process called 18A have faced delays and technical problems, with some customers so far declining to use it.\n\nIntel declined to make Gelsinger available for an interview.\n\n“Pat is leading one of the largest, boldest and most consequential corporate turnarounds in American business history,” Intel said in a statement. “3.5 years into the journey, we have made immense progress – and we’re going to finish the job.”\n\nIntel’s revenue shriveled to $54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from the year Gelsinger took over. Analysts expect Intel to lose $3.68 billion this year, its first annual net loss since 1986. Its shares closed at $22.92 on Monday, off 66% from a peak hit in Gelsinger’s first months as CEO.\n\nThe crash in Intel’s share price has sparked takeover interest, Reuters has reported. Intel has vowed to restructure and to cut more than 15,000 jobs.\n\nIntel said it won’t let merger speculation distract it from executing its five-year turnaround plan. Under Gelsinger, Intel said, it has revamped its operations, secured up to $45 billion in U.S. support, led the market for AI PC chips, and “achieved a historic pace” of innovation.\n\nIntel told Reuters its 18A fabrication technologies are yielding good-quality chips and that it “expects to return to process leadership in 2025” with their formal launch. The company said it objects to the “usage of rumors, leaked materials, half-truths and interviews based on the widest net that can be cast for ‘sources’ to gain negative commentary on Intel.”\n\nCustomers have little incentive to bet on Intel’s manufacturing when TSMC continues to serve them well, said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. “If you care about performance today, tomorrow, next year, over the next couple of years, you are not making that bet,” Hari said.\n\nStill, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in September U.S. manufacturing represents a supply-chain “insurance policy” that major chip designers would pay for. “They should want U.S.-made leading-edge chips,” she said.\n\nIntel’s stumbles have implications for U.S. industrial policy. Gelsinger’s vow to create a foundry raised hopes in the Biden Administration that Intel would help bring chip production back under U.S. control on U.S. soil.\n\nA White House spokesperson said that a bill championed by President Joe Biden, the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to invest in not one but dozens of companies strengthening the semiconductor supply chain. Intel has won more than $11 billion in proposed funding under the act.\n\nGelsinger’s journey at Intel started in 1979 when he was 18. He stayed for 30 years, coming under the tutelage of Andy Grove, Intel’s legendarily demanding former CEO, which Gelsinger likened to “going to the dentist and not getting Novocaine.” Gelsinger became Intel’s first chief technology officer but left in 2009 around a restructuring.\n\nIntel changed while he was away. Its so-called “Grovian” culture of constructive confrontation – one that encouraged peers to challenge each other with data – faded away. Intel also missed huge market opportunities. It stuck to its strengths, chips for desktop computers and servers. But it passed on a chance to produce semiconductors for the iPhone and declined to fund breakthrough artificial-intelligence company OpenAI.\n\nHis return in February 2021 gave a boost to Intel. Investors cheered his appointment, sending shares up nearly 7% on the day of the January announcement. Employees said they celebrated having a technologist back in charge.\n\nIntel, in Gelsinger’s view, needed to execute at a “torrid” pace. He at times wore a black T-shirt, available to buy at Intel’s company store, with the word “torrid” emblazoned on it. The energetic CEO did push-ups and jumping jacks before speaking at Intel events, a witness said.\n\nThe bet on which Gelsinger staked Intel’s future came less than two months into his tenure: a global foundry that could vie with TSMC. In March 2021, he promised to invest $20 billion in two Arizona factories. That July, he said Intel also would develop five manufacturing processes in four years. Among them was 18A, a bundle of technologies under development that he hoped would restore Intel’s manufacturing excellence.\n\nGelsinger pushed for Congress to subsidize American chip manufacturing. In January 2022, he stood with Biden to announce another $20 billion for two factories in Ohio. Gelsinger told Reuters at the time that Intel’s commitment in the state might reach $100 billion to create “the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet.”\n\n'Five reasons to believe'\n\nChip sales boomed in the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumers gobbled up tech gadgets. By the spring of 2022, with product prices spiking and workers returning to offices, a glut emerged. Intel’s revenue from personal computer chips dropped 25% in the second quarter of 2022. And it lost market share for chip sales in data centers to Advanced Micro Devices, while companies such as Amazon.com and Google increasingly designed silicon in-house.\n\nGelsinger called on staff to keep the faith. In regular video dispatches, he set out “five reasons to believe” in Intel, say four people who saw them. In an early video, seen by Reuters, he urged employees to “believe deeply in your heart and soul Intel’s best days are ahead.”\n\nIntel said Gelsinger “consistently balanced his optimism with a clear-eyed view of the challenges inherent in getting there.”\n\nGelsinger was optimistic with clients, too. He oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet’s growing fleet of Waymo self-driving taxis, set to roll out across the U.S., three people familiar with the previously unreported plans told Reuters. Gelsinger personally discussed the deal with Sundar Pichai, Alphabet’s CEO, two of the people said.\n\nBut after Intel’s outlook worsened in 2022, the company canceled the Waymo deal, the two people said, and paid a fee to Alphabet after Alphabet threatened legal action.\n\nSandra Rivera, who formerly ran Intel’s data center group and is now CEO of Intel-owned Altera, said in an interview that her team cut the Waymo project after a corporate reorganization required her to make “decisions about the entire portfolio.”\n\nIntel said it has a strong partnership with Alphabet and declined to discuss the project. Alphabet declined to comment on the matter.\n\nGelsinger announced cost cuts in October 2022 to bolster Intel while he continued to pour money into factories. The company said it would save $3 billion starting the following year from steps such as business exits and layoffs.\n\nUnder his watch, Intel’s headcount had risen to some 132,000 employees by the end of 2022 from about 111,000 when he joined. In its statement, Intel said the “unprecedented pace” at which it developed technology and capacity necessitated such hiring.\n\nChatGPT Moment\n\nNvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, posed a new challenge in November 2022. That month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that could conjure human-like prose on command. It became history’s fastest growing software application at the time. Nvidia’s chips power the data centers behind ChatGPT.\n\nOriginally designed for videogames, researchers discovered years ago that GPUs are useful for AI applications. They could handle vast numbers of simultaneous calculations better than central processing units, or CPUs, from Intel.\n\nNvidia saw its stock triple in eight months, notching a $1 trillion valuation. Intel’s stock saw choppy trading; it cut base pay for mid-level workers and restricted promotions and bonuses.\n\nGelsinger too would take a salary cut, Intel said. Still, his total compensation, including stock awards, rose to $16.9 million in 2023 from $11.6 million the year before, a proxy filing shows.\n\nAround this time, Gelsinger had high hopes for Intel’s Gaudi chip, a so-called AI accelerator – a processor that improves the performance of artificial intelligence applications. Intel touted the chip – designed in-house and made by TSMC – as an alternative to Nvidia’s often scarce GPUs.\n\nTeams at Intel estimated it could sell at most $500 million in AI chips, three people familiar with the forecast said. In a meeting with executives in the second quarter of 2023, Gelsinger said this number was not high enough. Intel needed to tell Wall Street it could hit at least $1 billion at a time when Nvidia’s comparable sales were far higher, one of the people cited Gelsinger as saying.\n\nGelsinger touted the $1 billion figure in public. On Intel’s July 2023 earnings-results call, he told analysts of “surging demand for AI products.” He added: “Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion's share.”\n\nAccording to one of these sources and another person briefed on the matter, Intel at the time of Gelsinger's announcement had not secured anything near the supply needed from TSMC to sell $1 billion in AI-accelerator chips. After Gelsinger demanded the billion-dollar target, Intel tweaked its math to justify it, lumping in chips unrelated to its marquee AI offering, two sources said.\n\nIntel said Gelsinger’s comments accurately reflected prospective deals, not sales. “No company converts 100% of its pipeline into revenue,” Intel said. “We make no apologies for setting ambitious internal targets for our teams – and we will always try to exceed the goals we set for ourselves.”\n\nAs recently as January of this year, Intel told investors it had more than $2 billion in possible AI chip deals in the pipeline. In April, Gelsinger revealed to analysts a much lower AI revenue goal for this year: more than $500 million.\n\nAt times, Gelsinger has told leaders at major clients that Intel could furnish alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, said three people familiar with the talks – including for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, two of them said. When customers sought details, Intel managers had little to show and some deals didn’t happen, the sources said.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment. Amazon referred Reuters to recent news about its work with Intel.\n\nIntel has struggled to pick an AI-chip strategy. It funded three projects simultaneously by 2019: a GPU of its own, and two other chips designed to perform AI calculations from a pair of companies it acquired. None of the three made significant inroads against Nvidia or AMD, Reuters has reported.\n\nOn Intel’s GPU efforts, Rivera, the former data center chief, told Reuters: “It’s a journey, and everything looks simpler from the outside.”\n\nIntel said the strategy anticipates how businesses will want to run AI more cheaply and how it alone can serve AI chip-design and manufacturing needs.\n\nManufacturing woes\n\nGelsinger kept pushing ahead despite setbacks, with Intel trumpeting factory expansions that would cost more than $60 billion. Then, this summer, he hit the brakes on some of these construction plans.\n\nIntel’s ambitious new process for making chips for other firms – 18A – also remains a question mark.\n\nSome customers have been disappointed by what they’ve seen of 18A.\n\nWhen one big prospect, chip and software company Broadcom, sent foot-wide wafers through Intel’s 18A process, the process was not ready for high-volume production for external customers, Reuters reported in September. No more than 20% of the chips printed via 18A passed Broadcom's early tests, two people briefed on the results said. That is low compared to TSMC’s early-stage yields.\n\nBroadcom told Reuters it has “not concluded” its evaluation of whether to use Intel’s foundry.\n\nOn the day of the Reuters report in September, Intel issued a statement saying it was on track to launch 18A in 2025 and had released tools for partners and customers to plan chips for the process.\n\nA recent planning document produced by an Intel supplier indicates delays, however. The document, seen by Reuters, noted the supplier is still waiting to receive another digital design kit it needs to push ahead. It also lacked access to Intel factories, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Customers have little prospect of making chips in high volume with the 18A process until 2026, two people said.\n\nApple and Qualcomm, among other potential clients, have passed on 18A for technical reasons, three peoplewith knowledge of their decisions said. Both companies declined to comment.\n\nIntel said it expects to reclaim leadership in chip-manufacturing processes in 2025 by launching 18A.\n\nGelsinger said in mid-September Intel had a “lot of work ahead,” but he continues to project confidence in his turnaround plan.\n\n“I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,” Gelsinger told Reuters in August. “Three years in, yeah. Thisone's going to happen, baby.”\n\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin, Max Cherney and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, and Fanny Potkin in Singapore; additional reporting by Milana Vinn in New York and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Claudia Parsons)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/05/stock-market-dow-jones-nasdaq-live-updates/74671156007/", "title": "Stock market recap: Recession fears send global markets plunging", "text": "'If the economy starts to deteriorate, the Fed's job is to act and we will act appropriately,' Goolsbee said.\n\nApple had its worst day since September 2022, shedding 4.82%.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index closed 106 points, or 3%, lower on Monday after a hair-raising morning drop, while the technology heavy Nasdaq composite fell 3.43% and the Dow Jones plummeted more than 1,000 points, losing 2.6%, as global markets washed out over worries of a possible recession in the world's biggest economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow saw their biggest drops since September 2022.

A carry trade is when investors borrow in yen at low interest rates and invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere.\n\nIf Japanese rates rise, the carry trade becomes less profitable, leading investors to sell their higher-yielding investments and buy back yen, thus increasing its value.\n\nJapan's Nikkei index fell to a seven year low on Monday.\n\n−Medora Lee\n\nDid the Fed wait too long to cut rates?\n\nThere are concerns the Fed waited too long to cut interest rates and will need to play catch-up with large cuts in borrowing costs to cushion the economy.\n\nIn June, U.S. central bankers anticipated only one cut this year, and saw the unemployment rate ending the year at 4%.\n\nWith the jobless rate now well above that, \"the soft landing in the U.S. labor market is in danger,\" wrote Nick Bunker, director of North American economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, referring to a scenario where inflation is tamed without a painful recession or sharp rise in unemployment.\n\nGoldman Sachs now sees a steady every-meeting series of Fed rate cuts and Citi called for half-percentage-point cuts in both September and December.

And why is it linked to Monday's turmoil?\n\nFor months, market observers have been talking about a popular trade in which investors borrowed in Japanese yen at very low interest rates, and then invested the borrowed money in high-growth investments like the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks that include Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta.\n\nConcerns about the carry trade had been rising for weeks, in part because of the enormous amount of money involved in it − an estimated $4 trillion. Those concerns soared on July 31, when the Bank of Japan raised interest rates from 0.1% to 0.25%.\n\nThat rate is still very low, of course, and in and of itself not a big deal for the carry trade. But it was the bank's largest rate hike since 2007, and currency traders took note of the implications.\n\nWith the yen stronger against the dollar, traders had to spend more to continue holding their \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks − and many chose to sell instead, helping to fuel a market panic.\n\n−John Rosevear, The Motley Fool\n\nMore:What is a carry trade, and how did a small rate hike in Japan trigger a global sell-off?\n\nCrypto hammered in mass sell-off\n\nU.S.-listed shares of crypto-linked companies slumped as Bitcoin fell more than 15% on Monday amid a frenzied selling of risky assets.\n\nThe plunge marks a stunning reversal for the sector that until recently was riding a wave of optimism sparked by the approval of exchange-traded funds tied to the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ether, the two biggest cryptocurrencies.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump's pro-crypto speech at a bitcoin conference last month also bolstered confidence, but data showing higher unemployment and weak manufacturing activity squeezed risky assets.\n\n−Reuters\n\nMore:Trump pledges national Bitcoin stockpile, to make US 'crypto capital of the planet'\n\nOutages at Vanguard, Schwab and others\n\nAs the stock market cratered this morning, thousands of customers reported outages at Vanguard, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, and Robinhood, according to downdetctor.com.\n\nSchwab posted on X just after 9 a.m. ET “Due to a technical issue, some clients may have difficulty logging in to Schwab platforms” and “hold times may be longer than usual.”\n\nRobinhood briefly halted trading on its 24-hour platform overnight, reports said.

What's a 'market correction'?\n\nIt's turning into a wild day for investors, homeowners and people hoping to retire, with lots of market terminology flying across the internet. Here's a brief glossary of terms giving a name to the financial pain:\n\n◾ Correction. A market drop of at least 10% from a recent high, which typically occurs about once a year\n\n◾ Pullback. When a specific stock or the market retreats 5% to 9.99% from a peak. While corrections may prompt some investors to reach for the Xanax, pullbacks can also be unnerving after long stretches of market calm. That said, pullbacks – which normally occur three to four times a year – are viewed as healthy and as buying opportunities.\n\n◾ Volatility. How much a stock or the market fluctuates in a period of time.\n\n◾ Bear market. When a stock or market index falls 20% or more.\n\n◾ Bull market. A sustained rise in stock prices without a bear market, or a 20% drop.\n\nWho is Warren Buffett?\n\nBuffett is a billionaire businessman and philanthropist whose influence on the U.S. stock market is significant. Dubbed the “Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett is considered one of the most successful investors of all time. He runs Berkshire Hathaway, a major conglomerate that owns GEICO, Duracell, Dairy Queen and other companies. And Berkshire's recent sale of a large portion of shares it owned in Apple sparked fears that Buffett might be souring on stocks amid a slowing economy.\n\nWall Street's 'fear gauge' spikes as stocks tumble\n\nWall Street's most watched gauge of investor anxiety logged its largest ever intraday jump on Monday, as U.S. stock futures tumbled on rising fears the country could be tipping into recession.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index jumped to a high of 65.73, up about 42 points from its close on Friday, as Wall Street looked set to continue the global stock rout that saw Japanese shares at one point exceed their 1987 \"Black Monday\" loss.\n\nThe VIX was last up 34 points at 57.15, its highest since March 2020.\n\n\"It seems like a liquidity crisis ... this is very, very unusual,\" said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager for Rational Equity Armor Fund.\n\n− Reuters\n\nMore:What happens during a recession?

If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage you’re looking to get out of, this is your chance.

Tesla's: $0 | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk has repeatedly bragged (or, perhaps, complained) that he’ll pay more in federal taxes for 2021 than anyone has ever paid — about $11 billion. But Tesla apparently won’t pay a cent.\n\nTesla may not plan to pay federal taxes any time in the foreseeable future – even though the company just reported by far its most profitable year ever. In 2021, Tesla recorded net income of $5.5 billion, and adjusted income of $7.6 billion.\n\nBut buried in a footnote of its recent annual financial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla reports that its US operations lost $130 million last year on a pre-tax basis. It claims that all of its pre-tax profits — more than $6 billion worth — came from overseas operations, even though 45% of its revenue came from US sales.\n\nAlthough Tesla indicates its foreign tax bill came to $839 million, its state tax bill was only $9 million. And its federal tax bill was zero.\n\n“That defies common sense, but it does not defy the US tax code,” said Martin Sullivan, chief economist for Tax Analysts, a nonprofit tax publisher, and an expert on US corporate tax practices.\n\nMoving profits overseas — on paper\n\nSullivan said he believes the $130 million loss on its US operations is most likely due to a common practice for US multinational corporations: structuring their operations so that overseas subsidiaries are the ones reporting income, leaving the US operation to have little or no taxable income to report.\n\nFor example, a company can assign its intellectual property to one of those foreign entities, and charge its US unit a fee for using that property. And thus, the foreign operation is very profitable, while the US company — burdened with “costs” to the company itself — reports either a loss or very little income.\n\n“It’s a US multinational thing. It’s very common. It’s almost malpractice not to do that,” said Sullivan.\n\nA recent report from the US Department of the Treasury found 61% of the international profits of US multinational companies are booked in seven small countries – Bermuda, the Caymans, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore and Switzerland – known as tax havens. It’s a practice that many elected officials and the Biden administration have vowed to crack down on.\n\n“Tesla and other giant corporations have long used scams and loopholes to help them get out of paying taxes – that has to stop,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a frequent critic of Musk. “Democrats are working to end Republican tax cuts for corporations shifting profits and jobs overseas.”\n\nHowever, Congress has so far failed to take action to stop it.\n\nThe financial filing by Tesla doesn’t spell out what it did exactly, though. For example, it doesn’t say which country or countries it made its profit in while reporting a US loss. And Tesla declined to respond to a question about its filing.\n\nTesla doesn’t expect to pay US taxes any time soon\n\nConsidering the substantial financial help that Tesla has long received from government support for its electric cars, the company doesn’t have to use a shell game of offshoring its profits to avoid paying taxes. Instead, it could use past losses to shelter its current income from any tax bill.\n\nOnce again, this is a common practice for companies that lose money: losses result in a future tax break.\n\nTech companies that lose money for years before turning a profit — such as Amazon (AMZN) — have used this technique. So have old line companies that have financial problems, such as all US airlines, which will probably not have to pay taxes for years to come after recording billions of dollars in losses during the pandemic — despite receiving billions in federal help.\n\nSimilarly, Tesla’s US automaking competitors lost so much money in the first decade of this century that General Motors and Chrysler needed government bailouts. Despite those bailouts, neither company paid taxes for several years once they were again profitable.\n\nPast losses are a huge and very valuable future tax benefit known as “net operating loss carry-forwards.”\n\nTesla was losing money for more than a decade before it finally started reporting net income in 2020. Those were real losses, which occurred when the costs of developing and building its cars in its early years far outstripped the money it could sell them for. It did so with the expectation that it would turn a profit in the future as demand increased and costs declined. That’s exactly what happened.\n\nBut, in running up billions of dollars in losses, Tesla was able to accumulate net operating loss carry-forwards that it could use in the future.\n\nStill, Tesla disclosed in this week’s financial filing that it did not use any of those past losses to shield current income from taxes. And it took a bookkeeping maneuver that suggests it doesn’t know if it will ever have to use those past losses to shield its US income.\n\nTesla is rather bullish about its future, expecting annual sales growth of 50% for the foreseeable future. If it believed that its pre-tax losses in its domestic operations was temporary, it likely would not have not taken that step of reducing the value of those past losses as a way of eliminating future US taxes, according to Sullivan.\n\nIs Tesla losing money at home?\n\nThere’s another possible reason that Tesla might have reported a pre-tax loss on its US operations: — one that isn’t as much an accounting maneuver designed to lower taxes as it is a warning sign about the viability of the company. Perhaps it still is losing money on the cars it is selling in the United States, and it can only make money using the lower costs of a relatively new factory in Shanghai, China.\n\nThat’s what one of Tesla’s most fervent critics and doubters believes. Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research, points out that Tesla was losing money overall until after it started producing cars in Shanghai in October 2019. He believes that investors are giving Tesla too much credit for profits in the US that he doesn’t believe are real.\n\n“I think it’s a massive deal,” he said about Tesla’s filing this week. “They effectively said they don’t plan on utilizing any of the net loss carry forwards. That means their US operations are losing money. It’s an argument we’ve made over and over again. Outside of China, Tesla loses money.”\n\nBut other analysts who have examined its books insist Tesla’s profits, both at home and overseas, are real, no matter what its US tax forms say.\n\nJohnson said if he’s wrong, it’s up to Tesla to be more transparent.\n\n“The reality is, until they provide disclosure, both explanations could be right,” he said.\n\nMusk’s rare big tax bill\n\nMusk has a history of using the US tax code to pay little or no personal federal income taxes. A report from ProPublica shows that for 2018 Musk and many other Americans near the top of the world’s richest people paid no income tax.\n\nIn Musk’s case, he receives no salary from Tesla, only very valuable stock options, as a form of compensation. And under US tax code he doesn’t have to pay taxes on those options until he exercises them to buy shares of stock at a fraction of their current value.\n\nHe also would have to pay taxes if he sells shares he already held because of his earlier investment in the company, which he has rarely done. But he did that last year as well.\n\nMusk has not exercised most of the options that he holds. But he had options to buy 22.9 million shares that were due to expire in August 2022, and started exercising those options to buy additional shares late last year.\n\nIn total, he spent $142.6 million to purchase shares worth $23.6 billion, giving him $23.5 billion in in taxable income, taxable for 2021 at a federal rate of about 41%.\n\nMusk also sold a small fraction of the additional shares he already owned, sales that fetched a taxable $5.8 billion at a lower capital gains rate.\n\nTogether those stock trades likely resulted in roughly an $11 billion federal tax bill, which he has tweeted about.\n\nBut that could well be the last time for years to come that he’s paying a substantial federal tax, unless Congress passes one of the various proposals to tax the net worth of the nation’s wealthiest individuals, rather than just their income. Several Democratic Senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden have proposed that, but so far it hasn’t come close to passing.\n\nNot surprisingly, Musk opposes such efforts, and has mocked all three senators on Twitter.\n\nThe options Musk exercised last year that produced the massive tax bill aren’t the end of his options. This week’s financial filing from Tesla discloses that Musk received another 8.4 million options, bringing his total to 67.5 million.\n\nBut none of those options expire until 2028. And thus it’ll probably be five years before he starts to exercise those options, unless he leaves the company before then.\n\nIf he is once again paying zero federal taxes, chances are good that his tax bill and his primary company’s tax bill will be the same during those five years.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/tech/theranos-rise-and-fall/index.html", "title": "The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes: A timeline | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nFour years after the top two Theranos executives, Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, were first indicted together on a dozen federal fraud charges stemming from their time heading up the failed blood testing startup, both have been convicted by juries.\n\nHolmes, the founder and former CEO of Theranos, was found guilty on four out of 11 federal fraud and conspiracy charges in January after a months-long trial. Balwani, Theranos’ former president and COO who was also Holmes’ live-in boyfriend at the time, was found guilty on Thursday of ten counts of federal wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\nTheir trials marked the final chapter for Theranos, a startup once valued at $9 billion and lauded for its promise to upend the healthcare industry. Theranos claimed its technology could accurately and efficiently test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. With that promise, it attracted $945 million in financing, a board of well-known political figures and prominent retail partners.\n\nThen came a Wall Street Journal investigation into the company, which called into question the company’s testing methods and the capabilities of its technology. In 2018, Holmes and Balwani were each charged with a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nTheir trials were separated after Holmes indicated she would pursue a defense that included alleging she was the victim of a decade-long abusive relationship with Balwani that impacted every part of her life. (Balwani’s legal team has strongly denied the allegations in court filings.)\n\nHere are the highlights of the rise and fall of Theranos.\n\nMarch 2004: Holmes drops out of Stanford to pursue Theranos\n\nHolmes, a Stanford University sophomore studying chemical engineering, drops out of school to pursue her startup, Theranos, which she founded in 2003 at age 19. The name is a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”\n\nSeptember 2009: Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani joins Theranos\n\nBalwani guarantees a $10 million loan to Theranos and soon after takes on a formal role at the startup. Balwani, roughly 20 years older than Holmes, first met her in 2002 through a program in Beijing to learn Mandarin. Balwani had enjoyed a successful career in the software industry, and following the sale of his e-commerce startup, was pursuing an MBA.\n\nThe two kept in touch and began living together in 2005, Holmes testified during her criminal trial. Their personal relationship was largely concealed from employees, investors and business partners. Balwani would ultimately become the company’s chief operating officer and president of the startup.\n\nSeptember 2013: Holmes opens up about Theranos; announces Walgreens partnership\n\nA decade after first starting the company, Holmes takes the lid off Theranos and courts media attention the same month that Theranos and Walgreens announce they’ve struck up a long-term partnership.

In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015.

Theranos agrees to pay $4.65 million back to its Arizona customers as part of a settlement deal.\n\nMarch 2018: Holmes and Balwani charged with massive fraud\n\nThe SEC charges Holmes and Balwani with a “massive fraud” involving more than $700 million from investors through an “elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.”\n\nThe SEC alleges Holmes and Balwani knew that Theranos’ proprietary analyzer could perform only 12 of the 200 tests it published on its patient testing menu.\n\nTheranos and Holmes agree to resolve the claims against them, and Holmes gives up control of the company and much of her stake in it. Balwani, however, is fighting the charges, with his attorney saying he “accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability.”\n\nMay 2018: “Bad Blood”\n\nReporter John Carreyrou, who first broke open the story of Theranos for the Wall Street Journal, publishes “Bad Blood,” a definitive look at what happened inside the disgraced company.

What ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN Business —\n\nFor over a decade, companies from Google to General Motors have poured billions of dollars into the pursuit of what was seen as the Holy Grail of driving technology: the fully self-driving car. Such vehicles would usher in an era of consumer safety and convenience, experts promised, and would be an immensely valuable product for carmakers.\n\nBut recently many of the main players in the autonomous vehicle game have been scaling back or outright abandoning their lofty ambitions. Last week Ford and Volkswagen pulled the plug on their self-driving effort, Argo AI, the latest admission from a hype-fueled industry that building a good self-driving car that’s also a profitable business may not happen anytime soon.\n\nWhen it all began\n\nArgo AI CEO and co-founder Bryan Salesky was part of a famed Carnegie Mellon University team that developed a primitive self-driving vehicle that won a Pentagon race in 2007.\n\nFour students on the team went on to co-found self-driving companies, which have raised billions since: Salesky, who founded Argo; Dave Ferguson at Nuro; and Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson at Uber-backed Aurora.\n\n“We started out doing this stuff because it was cool and it was a neat idea, but we weren’t quite sure how it was going to be used,” Salesky said in a 2019 interview.\n\nThe team’s self-driving Chevrolet Tahoe caught the eye of Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who went on to launch a self-driving car program in 2009, later dubbed Waymo, that ignited an industry. Competitors like Uber jumped in, fearful that being left out of self-driving would destroy their business’s future. (Uber launched its program in 2015 before selling it in 2020 following a costly lawsuit with Alphabet.)\n\nA Waymo robotaxi is shown in Arizona. Caitlin O'Hara/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGeneral Motors bought a self-driving company in 2016. Ford followed suit a year later with Argo AI. Uber rushed to scoop up engineers from Salesky’s alma mater, Carnegie Mellon.\n\nMore than $10 billion was invested in self-driving cars since 2010, McKinsey estimated.\n\nProponents of self-driving believed they were onto something big. Driving is the deadliest of the common forms of transportation, and a leading cause of death for many age groups. More Americans have died in traffic crashes than fighting in all of its wars.\n\nInvestors swooned at the potential to make billions while saving millions of lives.\n\nThis business would be huge, they said. “$7 trillion as autonomous vehicles become mainstream,” claimed Intel.\n\nBig talk, smaller results\n\nUrmson, while leading Google’s self-driving car project before founding Aurora, talked of his preteen son never needing to get a driver’s license. Optimism ran wild.\n\nWhy would anyone even own a car? Autonomous taxis would be even cheaper than walking, said one industry analyst.\n\n“Autonomous vehicles are able to acquire new skills faster than humans,” Salesky said in 2021.\n\nBut there was one problem. The technology could do impressive things but mastering all the situations we face as human drivers is tough. The billions invested in the technology haven’t yet been able to drive better than a human in some situations.\n\nThat’s been a problem for the long list of companies that set aggressive targets for self-driving cars. General Motors in 2017 promised mass production of fully autonomous vehicles in 2019. Lyft said in 2016 that half its rides would be self-driving by 2021. Ford talked up 2021 too, promising full self-driving vehicles deployed broadly.\n\nBut there’s a funny saying from the software world, known as the 90-90 Rule. Once 90% of the work is done, you only have 90% to go. The ability of self-driving car software to steer the vehicle within a highway lane is great, but being able to do so, even for thousands of miles at a stretch, isn’t enough. A self-driving car, without a steering wheel or pedals, would have to be able to drive itself in literally every situation possible.\n\nWith millions of miles being driven by humans every day, the number of tricky and unusual situations, called edge cases, is vast. Unusual events are individually, by definition, uncommon. But the sheer number of unusual events encountered by millions of drivers all over the world means that “unusual events” are quite common.\n\n“It’s really, really hard,” Waymo’s then-CEO John Krafcik said in 2018 of self-driving technology. “You don’t know what you don’t know until you’re really in there and trying to do things.”\n\nIndustry leaders have backed off their big claims. Waymo has said it will be decades before the technology is everywhere in the world.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk now largely stands alone for sticking with aggressive predictions. He’s said every year since 2017 that the software capable of full self-driving will probably arrive in the “next year.” The software hasn’t arrived though. Instead, the company has drawn increasing scrutiny from regulators for its big talk. It’s being investigated for the rear-ending of emergency vehicles stopped on roads, and appeared unable to identify motorcycles at times.\n\nHumbled but not defeated\n\nIn recent years many industry leaders have quietly acknowledged and tried to tweak their business plan. Urmson and Bagnell shifted to the development of self-driving trucks that drive mostly on highways, which are much easier to master.\n\nFerguson left the Google self-driving car project to start a company building fully autonomous vehicles without a person inside for goods delivery. It’s a far simpler challenge as there’s no worry about protecting people inside the vehicles. Even Google itself started working on self-driving trucks.\n\nCompanies developing lidar, widely seen as a key component for self-driving vehicles, as well as self-driving companies, have seen their stocks plummet recently.\n\nLidar companies Velodyne, Quanergy, Luminar, and Ouster have all seen their stocks pummeled this year. Autonomous truck companies Aurora, TuSimple, and Embark have all had huge dives too this year.\n\nTesla, which has promised “full self-driving” for years, has delivered a less ambitious driver-assist feature that’s enjoyed by some, but it is also a beta product with lots of room for improvement. It’s also facing several government investigations related to the technology.\n\nOnly VW and Ford’s Argo AI and GM’s Cruise stayed focused exclusively on true self-driving cars.\n\nNow only one of them remains.\n\nCruise is offering some rides to passengers in San Francisco at night. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGM’s Cruise offers a nighttime ridehail service in San Francisco, which completed 84 trips in June, 224 in July and 416 in August. (Driving in daytime is much harder as there’s more traffic including pedestrians and cyclists.) Ride fees are similar to riding with Uber or Lyft.\n\nCruise has lost $1.4 billion this year, and it cannot stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars per trip forever. It plans to expand service to offer rides in Austin and Phoenix later this year.\n\nCruise CEO Kyle Vogt said last week that “next year marks the beginning of our rapid scaling phase.”\n\nThere will be plenty of kinks to work out. The local government has raised safety and traffic concerns about Cruise’s expansion plans.\n\nSome longtime industry observers caution that self-driving technology still has a long way to go, a line of thinking Ford CEO Jim Farley echoed Wednesday.\n\n“Things have changed,” Farley said of Ford’s 2017 plans to broadly deploy self-driving cars in 2021.\n\nThe company is instead focusing on advanced driver-assist technology.\n\nAutomakers, aside from Tesla, largely rely on Mobileye, an Israeli tech company, for driver-assist technology. Intel spun out Mobileye last week, raising $861 million. The successful IPO suggests there’s still a robust market for driver-assist technology, even if it falls short of fully autonomous vehicles.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/energy/big-oil-green-claims-report-climate-intl/index.html", "title": "Big oil companies are spending millions to appear 'green.' Their ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBig oil companies are spending millions to portray themselves as taking action on climate change, but their investments and lobbying activities don’t live up to their planet-friendly claims, according to a new report.\n\nAn analysis from London-based energy and climate think-tank InfluenceMap found that the amount of climate-positive messaging used by five major oil and gas companies – BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies – is inconsistent with their spending on low-carbon activities.\n\nThe report comes as scientists have grown increasingly urgent in their warning that the world must slash the use of fossil fuels to prevent catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis. It also comes amid fresh criticism of oil companies’ growing profits as consumer energy costs soar.\n\nThe think tank analyzed 3,421 items of public communications materials for 2021 across the five companies and found that 60% of their messaging contained at least one “green” claim.\n\nInfluenceMap then calculated the amount of money the energy companies expected to spend on green investments last year and found on average just 12% of their capital expenditure budgets were going toward what the companies themselves consider low-carbon or renewable activities.\n\nIn some cases, those figures are on the rise. Shell, for example, says it plans to spend 12% of its capital expenses on renewable energy this year, up from 10% in 2021. And the company noted the InfluenceMap analysis does not account for investments outside of its Renewables and Energy Solutions division – investments such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, all of which climate scientists have said are important in the effort to wean off fossil fuel.\n\nStill, InfluenceMap says the companies’ imbalance between “green” messaging and investment is striking.\n\nIt appears to be part of a “systematic campaign to portray themselves as pro-climate to the public,” InfluenceMap program manager Faye Holder told CNN. “In the meantime, what we see is continued investment into this unsustainable energy system – predominantly for fossil fuels.”\n\nInfluenceMap also estimated the companies are spending around $750 million each year cumulatively on climate-related communication activities, based on the number of communications staff the companies employ. The think tank said in a statement that figure doesn’t include the cost of external advertising or PR agencies, so the true amount is likely “significantly higher.”\n\n“It seems to be just an evolution in the tactics that Big Oil is using to try to delay action on climate change,” Holder said.\n\nOveremphasis on green messaging\n\nThe five major oil companies are “misrepresenting their primary business operations” by “overemphasizing energy transition technologies” and green campaigns in their public relations, InfluenceMap said.\n\nThe report revealed several different types of “green” claims used by oil and gas companies in their 2021 public communications, the most popular of which was highlighting their support for the effort to transition away from fossil fuel and toward renewable energy. The second most popular type of claim was focused on support for emissions reductions.\n\nSome of the companies’ planet-friendly claims portrayed gas as a climate solution, according to the think tank. Natural gas, which typically emits less carbon dioxide than coal, is still a fossil fuel and is primarily made of methane – a significant contributor to the climate crisis.\n\nAmong the five companies, Shell had the biggest mismatch between pro-climate messaging and investments into “low carbon” activities, according to InfluenceMap, followed by ExxonMobil.\n\nThe analysis found that Shell used “green” claims in 70% of messaging, while only 10% of its spending is on low-carbon investments. Shell says it expects that figure to rise to 12% in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Exxon had green claims in 65% of messaging, compared to 8% of spending on green investments. ExxonMobil told CNN it is “investing more than $15 billion between now and 2027 on lower-emission initiatives,” and the company expects its green investments to triple by 2025.\n\nLobbying reveals focus on fossil fuels\n\nInfluenceMap also noted that these five companies continue to lobby policymakers to lock fossil fuels into climate policy.\n\n“The science is very clear” that “the use of fossil fuels needs to decrease significantly and rapidly,” Holder told CNN, citing the most recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. “But what we see from these companies is – particularly in the US and from industry associations – a real push for fossil gas to be included and to be considered as a ‘green’ or low-carbon solution.”\n\nThe report noted that InfluenceMap “found evidence of each company, with the exception of TotalEnergies, engaging policymakers directly to advocate for policies encouraging the development of new oil and gas in 2021-22.”\n\nShell told CNN it is growing its green investment rapidly. Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nFour of the companies – BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell – are members of the US trade association group American Petroleum Institute (API), which scientists and climate advocates have criticized for opposing regulations aimed at combating climate change.\n\nThe World Resources Institute, which was not affiliated with the analysis, has previously highlighted the issue of major oil and gas companies strategically using trade associations, including the API, to engage in greenwashing – deceptive advertising practices that make companies seem like their products are more climate-friendly than they actually are.\n\n“We urge all companies to re-examine their lobbying, political spending and participation in trade associations to ensure that their actions are fully aligned with their public statements on climate change,” said WRI in a 2021 statement.\n\n“API member companies continue to make investments towards innovation, research, and best practices to further reduce GHG emissions and tackle the climate challenge,” API’s senior vice president of communications Megan Bloomgren told CNN in a statement.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a Shell spokesperson said the company is “already investing billions of dollars in lower-carbon energy.”\n\n“To help alter the mix of energy Shell sells, we need to grow these new businesses rapidly,” the spokesperson said. “That means letting our customers know through advertising or social media what lower-carbon solutions we offer now or are developing, so they can switch when the time is right for them.”\n\nA spokesperson for Exxon told CNN the company is shooting for net-zero emissions in its operations by 2050, and noted that it achieved its 2025 emissions reduction goal four years early.\n\n“ExxonMobil is investing more than $15 billion between now and 2027 on lower-emission initiatives, and we anticipate a tripling of investment by 2025,” the spokesperson said in an email. “This reflects our commitment to reducing our own emissions and confidence in the market adoption of lower-emission solutions, such as [carbon capture and storage], hydrogen, and biofuels.”\n\nA TotalEnergies spokesperson said, “Our public announcements policy reflects the transformation of TotalEnergies in a multi-energy company.” TotalEnergies also noted that the report shows it has the largest forecast renewable energy capacity among the oil companies analyzed.\n\nCNN also requested comment from BP and Chevron but did not receive a response.\n\n“The world will still need oil and gas for many years to come,” the Shell spokesperson added. “Investment in them will ensure we can supply the energy people will still have to rely on, while lower-carbon alternatives are scaled up.”\n\nYet the UN Environment Programme has noted that current worldwide levels of oil and gas production would not meet climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement.\n\n“The world’s governments plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C,” according to the UNEP’s Production Gap report, adding that “most major oil and gas producers are planning on increasing production out to 2030 or beyond.”\n\nThe International Energy Agency has also reported that oil and gas companies must stop drilling now if the world hopes to prevent a climate catastrophe. Investment in new fossil fuel supply projects must stop immediately, the IEA said in 2021, and no new coal-fired plants should be approved.\n\nSoaring Energy Prices\n\nThe InfluenceMap report, which highlights companies’ relatively low levels of spending on green investments, comes as energy prices soar in Europe, while Big Oil continues to report high profits.\n\nEnergy prices have been increasing in Europe since last fall, driven by a spike in demand as countries lifted pandemic lockdowns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent drop in Moscow’s oil and natural gas exports to Europe in 2022, have pushed prices even higher.\n\nMeanwhile, a perfect storm has resulted in windfall profits for the oil industry: the highest oil prices in a decade, huge demand for refining crude so it can be used as fuel, plus governments’ renewed focus on energy security.\n\nExxon made nearly $17.9 billion in profit between April and June, almost four times what it earned during the same period in 2021. Chevron booked a profit of $11.6 billion, while Shell earned $11.5 billion.\n\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from the American Petroleum Institute.", "authors": ["Lauren Kent"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}]}

He said that at least 21 of them currently face the death penalty and six have already received death sentences.\n\nThe unprecedented national uprising has taken hold of more than 150 cities and 140 universities in all 31 provinces of Iran, Turk added.\n\nMore than 300 people have died since the demonstrations began, according to a human rights group. AP\n\n“We received reports that injured protesters fear going to the hospital for risk of being arrested by security forces,” he said.\n\n“I’m alarmed by reports that even children suspected of having participated in protests are being arrested at school, hundreds of university students have been summoned for questioning, threatened or suspended in part from entering university campuses.\n\n“I urge those holding power in Iran fully to respect the fundamental freedoms of expression, association and assembly.\n\n“No society can be calcified or fossilized as it may stand at a single point in time.

But Iceland chief Richard Walker “has warned that Britain's creaking food supply chains are on the brink of collapse”, with 1,000 of his staff - almost one in 20 - in isolation.\n\nHowever, Walker has also insisted that “there is absolutely no need to panic buy”, adding: “The people who should be panicking are the government.”\n\nThe isolation “shutdown” is replacing lockdown as pings also hit retail, tourism, transport manufacturing, the NHS and police forces, says the i news site. NHS England data seen by the site reportedly shows that “by the start of July, almost 14,000 staff were self-isolating or sick from Covid - a figure that will have increased substantially since”.\n\nTwo major rail networks, Southern and Thameslink, have announced plans to operate a reduced timetable from next week, while some BP petrol stations are experiencing fuel supplies owing to lorry driver shortages. The Road Haulage Association estimates that the country is short of around 100,000 HGV drivers.\n\nAnd many local authorities are having to delay waste collections or close recycling centres.\n\nEven engaged couples are being told to call off their big days after being pinged on the night before their weddings. The prime minister’s official spokesperson acknowledged that this “would be a difficult situation for anyone”. But “one in three people contacted either by Test and Trace or the app go on to develop coronavirus”, the spokesperson said, which “demonstrates the importance of isolating people when asked to do so”.\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told Sky News this morning that the current situation “is not going to last forever” but that the country would have to follow the rules until 16 August. From this date, people who have had their second Covid vaccine, and waited for the two-week period that it takes for the body to build immunity against the virus, will be allowed to bypass isolation even if they come into contact with somebody who tests positive. Under-18s will also be exempt.\n\nHowever, Kwarteng added that there was “no guarantee” that the rule change would go ahead, with the final decision due to be taken a week before.\n\nEarlier this week, Johnson said that a “small number” of double-vaccinated critical workers could soon be exempt from isolating, but ministers are yet to clarify who this would include.\n\nThe government was also accused of sending mixed messages after Downing Street contradicted two junior ministers who suggested that it was “up to individuals and employers” whether they decide to isolate after being pinged by the Test and Trace app.\n\n“Being pinged by the app means you should isolate for ten days - but unlike being contacted by Test and Trace, it is guidance rather than legally mandated,” explains Sky News. However, a No. 10 spokesperson said it was “crucial” to quarantine when asked.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Anahi Valenzuela", "The Week Us", "The Week Uk", "Devika Rao", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "Joel Mathis", "Rafi Schwartz", "Sorcha Bradley", "Justin Klawans"], "publish_date": "2021/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/11/27/northern-spotted-owl-habitat-threatened-oregon-fires/6344310002/", "title": "Northern Spotted Owl pushed to brink by Oregon wildfires", "text": "The Northern Spotted Owl was already struggling heading into 2020.\n\nBut this year's Labor Day wildfires brought another major blow to the iconic but fragile population of birds, pushing them closer to the \"extinction vortex,\" according to top researcher Damon Lesmeister.\n\nWildfires kicked up on powerful east winds Sept. 7 and burned across almost a million acres of forest in Western Oregon, torching critical habitat in the Opal Creek, Breitenbush and Mount Jefferson areas.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/04/27/navalny-nemtsov-putin-wealth-critics-poisoning-jail/7231878001/", "title": "Before Alexei Navalny, other Putin critics faced prison, poison, death", "text": "Victims include anti-corruption activists and whistleblowers.\n\nAlexei Navalny was poisoned and nearly killed, then was arrested.\n\nBoris Nemtsov lobbied for an investigation and was later shot and killed.\n\nAlexander Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210.\n\nThis story was originally published in 2022 and has been updated to reflect the death of Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny.\n\nDuring Vladimir Putin’s rise to power and fortune, he and his associates have been suspected of silencing some of those who raised questions about the source of his apparent wealth.\n\nPossibly dozens of people have been killed or survived poisonings and other assassination attempts or have had their investigations blocked or shut down, according to a USA TODAY investigation originally published in 2022.\n\nInterviews and a review of documents and reports at the time showed untold numbers of others have long looked the other way for fear of similar retribution. Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered economic sanctions that target Putin, his associates and his adult children.\n\nPutin's connections to the deaths of political rivals took on fresh new urgency with the death of longtime political critic and activist Alexei Navalny.\n\nRussian state media did not report a cause of death for Navalny, and a government spokesman offered no information about how he died. Navalny's wife blamed the Kremlin and called for justice, and President Joe Biden said, \"Make no mistake, Putin is responsible.\"\n\nSpecial report:The steps that made Putin 'the richest man in the world'\n\nSpecial report:U.S. sanctions target Putin's Russian family\n\nThe USA TODAY special report explored how Putin had amassed riches from the wealth of his country, enough that some described him as the richest man in the world. It also explored how critics including Navalny – who was in prison at the time – had been silenced, sometimes by death.\n\nHere are some of the more high-profile victims in the anti-corruption effort, including whistleblowers who tried to figure out how much he is worth and where the Russian leader obtained – and hides – his riches:\n\nA Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption activist, Navalny spent years making increasingly vocal efforts to call attention to Putin-linked wealth, corruption and cronyism, then in 2020 was poisoned and nearly killed.\n\nMonths later, in January 2021, he was arrested after returning to Russia.\n\nMore:Where is Navalny now?\n\nHis nonprofit anti-corruption foundation then released a two-hour documentary and 14,000-word report detailing Putin's rise to power, including his longtime associations with old friends from St. Petersburg who, according to advocates and years of media reports, have become fabulously wealthy in their own right.\n\nNavalny provided extensive detail about \"Putin's Palace,\" a billion-dollar villa on the Black Sea. He and other whistleblowers have said the palace was built for Putin and paid for by his close allies' allegedly illegal diversion of funds. The video and accompanying report described how \"right now and for the last 15 years the biggest bribe in history has been given and the most expensive palace in the world is being built.\"\n\nMore:Where allies have targeted the hundreds of sanctions against Russia\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 16, 2024, according to reports, Navalny had gone for a walk at the prison where he was being held, 40 miles north of the Arctic Circle. He reportedly \"felt unwell,\" lost consciousness and died. He was 47 years old.\n\nBoris Nemtsov\n\nA Russian opposition leader and activist, Nemtsov was murdered on a bridge nearthe Kremlin in 2015 after lobbying the U.S. Congress and European Parliament to investigate suspected Putin corruption.\n\nA physicist and liberal politician, Nemtsov was deputy prime minister – and likely successor – to President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s before Putin's rise to power. He later campaigned on exposing corruption and injustice, and denouncing Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. A recent U.K.-based investigation found he was shadowed by an agent linked to a Kremlin political assassination team for almost a year before he was shot to death.\n\nMore:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nSergei Magnitsky\n\nA rising-star young Russian tax lawyer, Magnitsky died in 2009 at age 37 in a Russian prison after being beaten and denied medical attention.\n\nMagnitsky had been hired by the American-born William Browder, at the time the biggest Western investor in Russia, to investigate the theft of taxes paid to the Russian government.\n\nAs Browder would later testify, Magnitsky helped blow the whistle on what he said was a $230 million fraud scheme implicating Putin. Eleven months later, he was dead. The Kremlin said he died of a heart attack, but Magnitsky's family and investigators said he was tied to a bed and beaten to death by eight prison guards with rubber batons.\n\nWilliam Browder\n\nFounder and CEO of Hermitage Capital, Browder helped persuade the U.S. government to pass the Magnitsky Act in his former lawyer’s name in 2012. The law allows the U.S. to sanction certain officials and prevent them from hiding money in the United States.\n\nThe London-based entrepreneur testified before Congress in 2017 that Putin was the “richest man in the world,” worth $200 billion, and that \"the purpose of the Putin regime has been to commit terrible crimes in order to get that money.” Browder also testified he has “had numerous threats from all up and down the Russian government for my own life” for speaking out against Putin-led corruption and for pushing to “freeze assets and ban visas of the people who killed Sergei Magnitsky and the people who commit other gross human rights abuses” in Russia.\n\nAccording to Browder’s testimony at the time, “There are seven people who have died either from murder or suspicious circumstances, and there's a number of other attempted murders” in connection with the Magnitsky Act and related efforts to uncover Kremlin corruption. (One, Magnitsky family lawyer Nikolai Gorokhov, survived a plunge from a fourth-floor balcony right before he was supposed to testify in court about it, a fall he later said was \"no accident.\")\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza\n\nA staunch supporter of Magnitsky's, Kara-Murza was poisoned twice and nearly died from multiple organ failures after what he said were assassination attempts by Russian agents.\n\nA longtime colleague of Nemtsov's, Kara-Murza was instrumental in the passage of the original Magnitsky legislation, which imposed targeted sanctions on Russian human rights violators. He was left in a coma after both attempts on his life, in 2015 and 2017, but recovered. Both incidents were widely viewed by Russian opposition figures as the Russian government’s retribution for his work on the Magnitsky sanctions.\n\nThen-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., advocated for Kara-Murza after the poisoning, writing: \"Now those who fear Vladimir’s voice have tried again to quiet it forever. I pray they haven’t, and I ask Americans and righteous people everywhere to be his voice in his absence.\"\n\nMcCaininstructed that Kara-Murza be one of the pallbearers at his funeral as a final dig at Putin.\n\nKara-Murza remained a government critic and was arrested in Russia in 2022 and charged with spreading false information about the military. He was later sentenced to 25 years in prison. In January 2024, his wife published a letter that said he had been held in solitary confinement for four months in a Siberian penal colony.\n\nAlexander Litvinenko\n\nA former spy for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB, Litvinenko was poisoned in London in 2006 after sipping tea spiked with a lethal radioactive poison known as polonium-210.\n\nLitvinenko had defected to the U.K. and became a prominent critic of Putin, coining the phrase “mafia state” to describe rampant Kremlin corruption and kleptocracy. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2021 that Russia assassinated Litvinenko and ordered Putin’s government to pay his wife 122,500 euros.\n\nLitvinenko had also crossed Putin by writing two highly critical books, \"Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within\" and \"Lubyanka Criminal Group.\" The first accused Russian secret services of staging deadly apartment bombings and other terrorist acts in 1999 to bring Putin to power. He also accused Putin of ordering the assassination of Russian anti-corruption journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006.\n\nMarina Salye\n\nAn outspoken St. Petersburg city official, Salye became one of the earliest critics of Putin’s accumulation of wealth in the early 1990s, after he returned from his undercover KGB mission in East Germany and began working as deputy mayor for international relations.\n\nIn one of many documented conspiracies, Salye and others accused Putin of scheming to give lucrative export licenses for raw materials, including oil products, timber, aluminum and cotton. The deals were intended to raise money to feed hungry residents.\n\nBut Salye and another city official, Yuri Gladkov, found that as much as $122 million had vanished and said the barter scheme was a scam to enrich Putin and his cronies while the city's population continued to starve. They also developed suspicions about the disbursement of another $900 million in city funds. In 2000, after campaigning against Putin’s run for president of Russia, she was threatened and went into hiding, reemerging a decade later to share publicly her documentation of Putin’s alleged corruption.\n\nSalye died in 2012 just weeks after urging that Putin be tried for corruption. Gladkov died in 2007 from what some associates suspected was poisoning by mercury intoxication or other exposure to heavy metals.\n\nSergei Kolesnikov\n\nA Russian businessman who left Russia out of fear for his personal safety, Kolesnikov in 2010 publicly exposed a gargantuan Black Sea palace allegedly commissioned by Putin and built with more than $1 billion in illegally diverted funds.\n\nKolesnikov provided four pages of detail about what has come to be known as “Putin’s Palace” in a whistleblower letter to then-President Dmitry Medvedev, urging him to investigate the corruption surrounding Putin, who was prime minister at the time because of an eight-year term limit on presidents.\n\nA business associate of a Putin ally, Kolesnikov wrote that the palace in an exclusive part of Gelendzhik Bay was paid for through “corruption, bribery and theft,” including secret contributions by Roman Abramovich and other top oligarchs. \"This unpleasant tale of illegal payments, with threats, and with rampant corruption portends poorly for our beloved nation as we continue to struggle to improve the lives of all Russians and be a full partner in the global community of nations that ascribes to the rule of law.\"\n\nAndrey Zykov\n\nA lieutenant colonel and organized crime investigator with Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, Zykov was one of the first government officials to focus on Putin and his alleged ties to organized crime figures and criminal racketeering conspiracies in St. Petersburg in the 1990s.\n\nZykov initially began investigating Putin and his small circle of friends who founded the Ozero (Lake) Dacha Cooperative, an exclusive gated community on Lake Komsomolsk. When Putin became president, Criminal Case #144128, known widely as “Putin’s case,” was shut down and Zykov was forced into retirement.\n\nHe spoke at length in a 2015 Radio Free Europe documentary “Who Is Mr. Putin” about Putin corruption – but no longer wishes to talk publicly, the film’s co-producer Anastasia Kirilenko told USA TODAY in 2022.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/19/ukraine-news-russia-invasion-updates/7110747001/", "title": "Ukraine updates: No Mariupol surrender; Zelenskyy calls on Israel", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, March 20. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Monday, March 21, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\nUkraine has rejected a Russian offer to allow two safe corridors out of the besieged city of Mariupol in exchange for Ukrainian fighters laying down their arms.\n\nThe Russian news agency TASS reported the offer, citing Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, and said residents of the southern port city were given until 5 a.m. Monday to respond.\n\nMizintsev didn't have to wait that long for an answer. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk rejected the idea outright.\n\n“There can be no talk of any surrender, laying down of arms. We have already informed the Russian side about this,” she told the news outlet Ukrainian Pravda. “I wrote: 'Instead of wasting time on eight pages of letters, just open the corridor.'\"\n\nThe pounding of Mariupol intensified Sunday and a top U.S. official expressed concern about the prospect of Russian-organized \"concentration and prisoner camps\" as Russia's bloody assault on Ukraine waded deeper into its fourth week.\n\nThe Mariupol city council accused the Russian military of bombing an art school where about 400 people had taken shelter. There was no immediate word on casualties at the school, but the city council said on social media the building was destroyed and people could remain under the rubble.\n\n\"Russia continues the genocide of the Ukrainian people and civilians of Mariupol,\" the post said. \"Every war criminal will answer for his crimes against humanity, against the people of Mariupol.\"\n\nThe assault on Mariupol prompted a local police officer, in a video verified by the Associated Press, to appeal for help to President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe city council also claimed Russian soldiers have forced more than 1,000 city residents to be relocated to Russia.\n\n\"The occupiers illegally took people out of the Levoberezhny district and a shelter in the building of a sports club where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from constant bombing,\" the council said.\n\nUkrainian passports were taken from people who were given a piece of paper that \"has no legal weight and is not recognized throughout the civilized world,\" the city council said. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Sunday that she could not confirm those reports but expressed concern about the prospect of Russian-organized \"concentration and prisoner camps.\"\n\nU.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" said it is \"unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.\"\n\nLatest developments\n\n► An ammonia leak at a Sumy chemical plant has been contained, according to officials. The Sumykhimprom plant has been regularly shelled by Russian troops in recent weeks, according to the Associated Press.\n\n► Emergency services say at least four people were killed by overnight shelling near a city center in Kyiv late Sunday, according to the Associated Press.\n\n► President Joe Biden will host a call Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to “discuss their coordinated responses to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” the White House said.\n\n►The war has driven 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi tweeted. About 3.3 million have fled the country, and the rest have been \"displaced inside the country,\" he said.\n\n►President Joe Biden's planned trip to Europe this week does not include a stop in Ukraine, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki tweeted Sunday. The trip will include a stop at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Thursday, and Biden will travel Friday to Poland.\n\n►Management of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in 1986, said Sunday that 50 staff members who had been on the job since the plant was seized by Russian forces on Feb. 24 have been rotated out and replaced. Officials feared their exhaustion could lead to an accident.\n\n►Researchers tracking Russian equipment losses that were photographed or recorded on video say Russia has lost more than 1,500 tanks, trucks, mounted equipment and other heavy gear. Two out of three of those were captured or abandoned.\n\n►Russia said it used a hypersonic missile Friday to strike a western Ukraine target, the Interfax news agency reported. Hypersonic missiles can move at up to five times the speed of sound. The Russian military said these missiles are capable of hitting targets from 1,200 miles, or roughly the distance from New York City to Kansas City.\n\nBritain officials: ‘Kyiv remains Russia’s primary military objective’\n\nDespite a ”continued lack of progress,” Kyiv remains Russia’s primary military objective, according to British military officials.\n\nHeavy fighting continues north of the city in north-central Ukraine, but \"the bulk\" of Russian forces remain more than 15 miles from the center of the city, Britain’s Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update.\n\n“Russian forces advancing on the city from the north-east have stalled,” the update reads. “Forces advancing from the direction of Hostomel to the north-west have been repulsed by fierce Ukrainian resistance.\"\n\nThe ministry says Russia will likely prioritize attempts to encircle the city in the coming weeks.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nNew Zealand offers non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine\n\nNew Zealand plans to provide $5 million New Zealand dollars ($3.5 million) in non-lethal military assistance to support Ukraine. Funds will primarily go toward the NATO Trust Fund, which provides fuel, military rations, first aid kits and more to Ukraine.\n\n“This is the first time New Zealand has provided direct funding to a third party organisation for non-lethal military assistance of this kind,” Prime Minister Jacinda said in a statement. \"By contributing directly to the NATO Trust Fund, Ukrainian forces on the ground can benefit from the additional assistance immediately.\"\n\nNew Zealand will also make a variety of surplus defense equipment available to share with Ukraine, including body armor, helmets and vests.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nAmmonia leak at Sumy plant\n\nAn ammonia leak at a chemical plant in eastern Ukraine has potentially contaminated a 3-mile radius, according to Sumy regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy. He did not say what caused the leak.\n\nThe Sumykhimprom plant, located on the eastern outskirts of Sumy, has been regularly shelled by Russian troops in recent weeks, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPeople are advised to leave the affected area or take shelter. Zhyvytskyy said the city of Novoselytsia was at risk, but Sumy was not under immediate threat due to the direction of the wind.\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nDeputy National Security Adviser: US can broaden sanctions against Russia\n\nDeputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh said Sunday that the U.S. has the ability to broaden its sanctions against Russia.\n\n“(We can) take the measures, take the sanctions we've already applied, apply them in more targets. Apply them to more sectors,” Singh told CBS' 60 Minutes. “More banks, more sectors that we haven't touched.”\n\n“It's mostly about oil and gas, but there are other sectors too,” he added. “I don't want to specify them, but I think Putin would know what those are.”\n\nWhen asked what Putin would need to do to have sanctions lifted, Singh said \"we're nowhere near that point.\"\n\n“The first thing (Putin) has to do is to stop a reckless and barbaric attack on the civilians of Ukraine,\" he said. \"That's not happening.”\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nZelenskyy: Russia's siege of Mariupol will be remembered for centuries\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the siege of Mariupol would go down in history for what he described as war crimes committed by Russian troops and raised the specter of a \"third world war\" if negotiations with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin fail.\n\n“To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,” Zelenskyy said in a video address to his nation Sunday.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russia is killing citizens in Ukraine because its invasion has stalled, describing the tactic as \"disgusting.\"\n\n“We’ve seen deliberate targeting of cities and towns and civilians throughout the last several weeks,” Austin said on CBS' \"Face The Nation.\"\n\nThe United Kingdom’s Defense Ministry assessment released Sunday mirrored Austin's concerns. The ministry said Russia has increased its indiscriminate shelling of urban areas, resulting in widespread destruction and large numbers of civilian casualties.\n\n\"Over the past week Russian forces have made limited progress in capturing these cities,\" the ministry tweeted Sunday. \"It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower to support assaults on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses – at the cost of further civilian casualties.\"\n\nZelenskyy appealed to Putin to hold talks with him directly and said ongoing negotiations with Russia were “not simple or pleasant\" but are necessary.\n\n\"I think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin,\" Zelenskyy told CNN's Fareed Zakaria.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.''\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAs civilian casualties mount in Ukraine, Russia also taking major losses, including five generals\n\nIt's impossible to get precise figures for the civilian casualties in Ukraine, but even low estimates paint a grim picture. On the other hand, Russia is paying a hefty price as well, apparently including the loss of five generals.\n\nAt least 847 civilians, including 64 children, have been killed since Russia launched its offensive Feb. 24, the U.N. Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner reported Saturday. The agency acknowledged the actual figures are much higher. Agents also estimated the violence had left nearly 1,400 civilians injured, including 78 children. The Ukraine government estimates that 2,300 people have died in the ongoing siege of Mariupol alone.\n\nEstimates of Russian deaths also vary widely. The Ukraine government puts the Russian death toll at more than 14,000. Even conservative figures are in the low thousands – a much faster pace than in previous Russian offensives, threatening support for the war among ordinary Russians. Russia had 64 deaths in five days of fighting during its 2008 war with Georgia. It lost about 15,000 in Afghanistan over 10 years, and more than 11,000 over years of fighting in Chechnya.\n\nLess than four weeks into its invasion, Russia appears to be down five generals. Ukraine said Saturday that Lt. General Andrei Mordvichev was killed by an airstrike north of Crimea, adding that he was the fifth Russian general killed in the war.\n\nNATO summit to bolster support of Ukraine, show unity\n\nThe U.S. and NATO are trying to straddle the line between assisting Ukraine in its efforts to fight off the Russian invasion and getting directly involved.\n\nAt a special summit this week, NATO is expected to discuss enhancements of the military, humanitarian and financial support it members are providing Ukraine, officials said, while stiffening economic sanctions on Russia and President Vladimir Putin. At the same time, the officials caution about the need to keep the conflict from increasing in scope.\n\nIn several news show interviews Sunday, U.S. and global security officials said potential topics of discussion at the summit include the prospect of deploying a peacekeeping force in Ukraine and the chances of Russian-Ukrainian peace talks. And they again warned Russia against using chemical weapons in Ukraine.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" the summit will serve as a \"platform to demonstrate our unity, our support to Ukraine, but also our readiness to protect and defend all NATO allies.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nZelenskyy asks Israel for help, cites similarities in Ukraine's struggle with what Jews endured\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew a parallel between what his besieged countrymen are enduring during the Russian invasion and the misery imposed on the Jewish people by the Nazis as he pleaded for help and a stronger stance against Russia's attack from Israel.\n\nIn a video address to the Israeli parliament Sunday, Zelenskyy urged the lawmakers to take action against Russia, accusing its President Vladimir Putin of trying to carry out a “final solution” against Ukraine. The term was used by Nazi Germany for its genocide of some 6 million Jews during World War II.\n\n“Our people are now wandering in the world, seeking security as you once did,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nZelenskyy, who is Jewish, also pointed out a Russian missile struck Babi Yar, the spot in Kyiv where over 30,000 Jews were slaughtered in 1941 by the Nazis and now serves as Ukraine’s main Holocaust memorial. “You know what this place means, where the victims of the Holocaust are buried,” he said.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: US must stop telling Russia 'what we won't do'\n\nThe United States and NATO must stop publicizing their unwillingness to get too involved in the Ukraine war, Rep. Liz Cheney said Sunday. The West must make it clear that all options are being considered – and that use of chemical weapons could alter our calculation. She said \"telling the Russians what we won't do\" is not helpful, adding that it's very important that Russian President Vladimir Putin not \"reap any rewards\" for his aggression.\n\n\"Putin’s actions so far have demonstrated first of all, that the Russian military is nowhere near as capable as the world perhaps thought it was,\" Cheney said. \"Probably not as capable as Putin thought it was.\"\n\nPope denounces 'cruel and sacrilegious inhumanity' of war\n\nPope Francis denounced Russia’s “repugnant war” against Ukraine as “cruel and sacrilegious inhumanity.” In some of his strongest words yet since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, Francis on Sunday told thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square that every day brings more atrocities in what is a “senseless massacre.”\n\n“There is no justification for this,” Francis said, in an apparent reference to Russia, which sought to justify its invasion as vital for its own defense. But Francis again stopped short of naming Russia as the aggressor. Pontiffs typically have decried wars and their devastating toll on civilians without citing warmongers by name.\n\nFrancis also called on “all actors in the international community” to work toward ending the war. “Again this week, missiles, bombs, rained down on the elderly, children and pregnant mothers,” the pope said. His thoughts, he said, went to the millions who flee. “And I feel great pain for those who don’t even have the chance to escape,’’ Francis added.\n\nRussia regrouping, Ukraine military says\n\nRussian forces focused on sorting out logistics and regrouping on Saturday rather than undertaking offensive operations, Ukraine military officials reported in a Sunday morning update. The military maneuvers, or lack thereof, have experts around the world increasingly concerned that a stalemate could be on the horizon, with \"enormous casualties\" possible as troops focus on civilian targets.\n\nA report from the Institute for the Study of War concluded that Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of the war, but the report also highlighted activity of Russian forces, which have shown signs of \"digging in around the periphery of Kyiv and elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Stalemate is not armistice or cease-fire. It is a condition in war in which each side conducts offensive operations that do not fundamentally alter the situation. Those operations can be very damaging and cause enormous casualties,\" Frederick W. Kagan, George Barros and Kateryna Stepanenko wrote in an assessment published Saturday.\n\nThe findings echo what experts told USA TODAY last week. A “quagmire is the realistic 'goal,’” said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nRussia’s number of dead and wounded in Ukraine is nearing the 10% benchmark of diminished combat effectiveness, said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia’s security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals – out of an estimated 20 in the fight – signal impaired command, he said. On Saturday, Ukraine said it had killed a fifth Russian general.\n\nRussians will need massive troop numbers to hold cities they capture\n\nWhen it comes to the grinding job of capturing and holding cities, conventional military metrics suggest Russia needs a 5-to-1 advantage in urban fighting, analysts say. The formula for ruling a restive territory in the face of armed opposition is 20 fighters for every 1,000 people – or 800,000 Russian troops for Ukraine’s more than 40 million people, said Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank.\n\nThat’s almost as many as Russia’s entire active-duty military of 900,000, and it means controlling substantial Ukrainian territory long term could take more resources than Russia can commit, he said.\n\n“Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal – they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation – there will be just constant guerrilla war,” Clarke said.\n\nUkrainian refugees flee to Moldova amid harrowing Russian attacks\n\nOf more than 3 million refugees who have fled Ukraine since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, about two-thirds have gone to Poland. But an estimated 350,000 have entered Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries. Most are women and children, as most men of fighting age have been ordered to stay behind to defend their country.\n\nNow, government workers and aid groups are trying to help, conducting a hurried symphony across multiple languages, from Russian and Romanian, which is spoken in Moldova, to French and English. They're fingerprinting and photographing refugees, double-checking documents and providing emergency cash to the most needy.\n\nThe Ukrainian refugees in Moldova include Kristina Paleshev, whose five kids have been waking up at night startled by any loud noises, frightened that they are again under attack.\n\n\"We want to go back. I love my country and my town,\" Paleshev, 38, said, as a tear rolled down her cheek. \"I’m crying because our people are being killed.”\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nZelenskyy restricts political parties tied to Russia\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ordered the suspension of activities of 11 political parties with links to Russia. The largest of them is the Opposition Platform for Life, which has 44 out of 450 seats in the country’s parliament. The party is led by Viktor Medvedchuk, who has friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter.\n\nAlso on the list is the Nashi (Ours) party led by Yevheniy Murayev. Before the Russian invasion, British authorities warned that Russia wanted to install Murayev as the leader of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking in a video address early Sunday, Zelenskyy said “given a large-scale war unleashed by the Russian Federation and links between it and some political structures, the activities of a number of political parties is suspended for the period of the martial law.” He added that “activities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed.”\n\nZelenskyy’s announcement follows the introduction of the martial law that envisages a ban on parties associated with Russia.\n\n20 babies from surrogate moms in bomb shelter\n\nIn peacetime, Ukraine has a thriving surrogate industry, one of the few countries where foreigners can contract women to carry their pregnancies. Now at least 20 of those babies are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter in Ukraine’s capital, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up.\n\nThey’re well cared for at the moment. Surrogacy center nurses are stranded with them, because constant shelling makes it too dangerous for them to go home. Russian troops are trying to encircle Kyiv.

Kevin Cosby has gone from leader of a small West End church to one of the most influential pastors in Kentucky\n\nHis social gospel: Rebuilding black education, wealth and institutions crippled by Jim Crow.\n\nHis prominence means he has the ear of political leaders and the ability to challenge them, a peer says.\n\nThe Rev. Kevin Cosby is half-singing, half-shouting as he thunders to the end of a sermon on the importance of respecting what's sacred from the book of Daniel.\n\nHe references the American flag, drawing approving calls of \"preach!\" when he suggests NFL players were still justified in taking a knee to protest racial injustice during the national anthem.\n\n“Can I get a witness?” he asks from behind his clear glass pulpit on a recent Sunday morning.\n\nAn organ punctuates his vocal gymnastics as Cosby transitions into a gospel song, bringing worshippers in St. Stephen’s western Louisville mega-church to their feet in a chorus of amens and ecstatic applause. Then he’s gone, hustled by a team of aides out a side door, handed a topcoat and brimmed hat and packed into an SUV.\n\nAs he’s whisked across the Ohio River to one of three St. Stephen branches, he outlines to a reporter the roots of the racial wealth gap, peppering his conservation with scholarly citations, before striding through a back door. He's just in time to deliver his third of five Sunday sermons that blend scripture and racial justice and have made him one of Kentucky's most influential preachers.\n\nLast month, the 60-year-old grandson of an Alabama sharecropper entered his 40th year leading one of Kentucky’s largest churches of nearly 14,000 members, cementing his legacy as a sometimes controversial educator tirelessly preaching his social gospel: Rebuilding black education, wealth and institutions still crippled by the legacy of Jim Crow laws, which he says allows unequal treatment to persist.\n\n“He is always teaching, he’s always challenging you,’” said Sadiqa Reynolds, president of the Louisville Urban League, who first attended Cosby's church in the early 1990s as a college student and remains close to him.\n\nYou may like:Respect, fear, obey. That's the message from police in Kevin Cosby case\n\nCosby, who also rebuilt and leads historically black Simmons College, leverages his 12,400 Twitter followers and close relationships with civic leaders to unceasingly spotlight inequalities faced by African-Americans and those in Louisville's predominantly black West End.\n\nThat's where Cosby made national headlines in September after he and his wife were stopped by Louisville police in what Cosby has said appeared to be racial profiling. Cosby filmed the stop of his Audi sedan in a video posted on social media and viewed 69,000 times.\n\nSome saw a rueful lesson for a preacher who eschews street protests and once suggested people “stop twerking” and “start working” during demonstrations over police shootings. But Cosby stuck to his approach. Instead of taking to the streets or demanding a policy change, he called Mayor Greg Fischer personally and penned an op-ed in the Courier Journal. The issue was debated at a monthly forum hosted by St. Stephen.\n\nThen he got back to his institution-building mission. Among a long history of justice-minded black ministers there are \"tree shakers\" and \"jelly makers,\" Cosby said.\n\nOne gets the fruit off the tree and brings issues to light, he said, while others build black-controlled institutions such as churches, businesses and schools to reach larger goals.\n\nCosby proudly declares himself a jelly maker.\n\n“There are those in our community who think that if you don’t (lead marches), you’re not in the war,” he said. But “somebody’s got to make the jelly.”\n\n♦♦♦\n\nOne recent morning inside a book-crammed attic study in Cosby’s 92-year-old western Louisville home perched on the Ohio River, Cosby was playing Bach on an iPad as he studied his next sermon. His preaching style is simple, he said: Start low, move slow, raise higher, catch on fire.\n\nAround him, shelves strain with titles on black church life, biblical analysis, economics, history, marriage and race, with authors from England's Winston Churchill to Harvard's Cornel West. Rows of pen-scrawled sermons line a corner with such titles as, “Fight the Power: Strategies to Resist Injustice and Oppression.”\n\nCosby says he’s never had a drink or cigarette in his life and never misses his 5 a.m. workout in his basement gym, and still fits in his clothes from 40 years ago despite a weakness for Dairy Queen.\n\n“This is what I wake up in the morning thinking about, go through the day thinking about and go to bed at night thinking about,” said Cosby, whose soft-spoken demeanor turns forceful when the subject comes up. “How can we build institutions that help lift what is becoming a permanent caste group in America?”\n\nMore:Rev. Kevin Cosby's traffic stop sparks demand for full-bore policy review\n\nCosby's driving mission is rooted in the lessons of his past.\n\nHis father’s family left Alabama in the 1940s to look for work in Louisville. Cosby’s childhood was dominated by St. Stephen, the then-small California neighborhood church. His grandfather, B. J. Miller Sr., was the pastor for 44 years.\n\nWhen Cosby wasn’t attending all-black Stephen Foster Elementary, he was at the church where his father was a deacon and his mother was the minister of music. He played on a tiny pulpit made for him. He baptized his three sisters’ Barbie dolls and took offerings of Monopoly money. His parents emphasized his education.\n\n“Oh Jesus, they were hard,” he said. “You would get whipped if you didn’t make your grades. I mean whipped. Belt, switch. You’d better not act up in school or bring home bad grades.”\n\nJust shy of his 11th birthday, Cosby's mother died of cancer, devastating him and his sisters. A year later, Cosby’s father moved the family to the eastern suburbs for better education. That meant attending Waggener Junior High, where his grades plummeted.\n\n“It was a nightmare. I can’t tell you how many times I’d have to go outside because kids in the hall called me the N-word,” said Cosby, who found refuge on Sundays, back at church.\n\nHe recalled one time when a drunken man in his apartment swimming pool near Mall St. Matthews wouldn't let him out of the water and made him tread water until he called himself the same epithet, an experience that still brings tears.\n\nAfter graduating from Ballard High in 1976, he went on to study history at Eastern Kentucky University. That's where he met Barnetta Turner, who had grown up in rural Madison County, Kentucky. Cosby would switch seats in class to sit next to her, handing her M&Ms he'd bought in the bookstore. He finally won her over, and the two married before they graduated.\n\nWayne Lewis:Kentucky must raise the bar on high school graduates\n\nIn 1977, on a break from college, he was driving his stepmother's Buick LeSabre to a prayer meeting in St. Matthews. He was lost when a police officer stopped him for no apparent reason. As Cosby reached for his wallet, the officer held a gun to him. The officer eventually apologized, but echoes of the stop – being treated with suspicion because of his race – would play out in instances on airplanes and hotels later in his life, he said.\n\n“You cannot be black in America and not experience that,” he said.\n\nCosby was just 21 when he was asked to become the pastor of St. Stephens. At that time, in 1979, it was just a few hundred members clustered in a neighborhood that has long struggled with crime and poverty.\n\nHe saw the effects of policies such as segregation, redlining and lending discrimination were all around him. They had visibly hobbled families' abilities to buy homes, pass down wealth or attend college.\n\nHis ministry also grew at a time when the boycotts and sit-ins of the civil rights era had receded and more social-justice ministers were focusing on building black education and institutions, said David Daniels, a professor of church history at Columbia Seminary in Chicago.\n\nDrawn by the young pastor's \"Afrocentrism\" message and adult Sunday schools that taught topics like black history and financial literacy, St. Stephen got so packed that members developed an “On the Wall” committee, men who would stand along the wall during services to allow women to sit. Overflow Sunday school sessions were held in nearby homes.\n\nToday, St. Stephen has a 1,700-seat sanctuary on 15th Street, and with branch campuses in Jeffersonville, Indiana, and Radcliff, Kentucky, it routinely draws 5,000 people each weekend. Even more watch online. Its $4 million Family Life complex now includes a gym and fitness facility, sit-down meals at Frederick’s restaurant, a grocery and community programming such as tutoring and home ownership clinics.\n\n“The black church is more than just a place of worship,\" Cosby said, particularly in a neighborhood battered by population loss and disinvestment. \"It’s central to the heart of the community. It’s networking. It's politics. It's education. It's the hub of the black community.\"\n\nIn 1997, Cosby set his sights on another institution.\n\nWith cash infusions from the church, St. Stephen purchased property of the former black-owned Simmons University, which had shut down during the Depression. Part of it had moved elsewhere as a small Bible college. Now it is reborn as Simmons College of Kentucky. Ten years after Cosby became its president, the school in 2015 was designated as one of America's 107 historically black colleges, bringing federal funding.\n\n“Many of the students wouldn’t otherwise be in school” based on grades and ACT scores,\" Raymond Burse, the former president Kentucky State University, said of the roughly 220 students majoring in areas such as music, sociology and religious studies.\n\nBurse said it fills a void. “Simmons is a place that provides that nurturing environment, tells kids they are worth something and there is something to be gained from doing it,\" he said. About 30 students are housed in restored shotgun homes near St. Stephen. A 2014 University of Georgia study estimated that Simmons had a $3 million economic impact on the regional economy.\n\nCosby's reach includes forays into media, including his church's sponsorship of a popular Saturday morning radio show and columns in local publications. He only recently began taking a $75,000 salary after foregoing it for years as president of Simmons, but he declined to say what he earns at St. Stephen.\n\nHis prominence means he has both the ear of political leaders and the ability to challenge them, said Joe Phelps, pastor of Highland Baptist and a progressive Cosby ally.\n\nAfter Gov. Matt Bevin visited western Louisville in 2017 and called for prayer walks as a solution to violence in the area, Cosby wrote a scathing column saying that Bevin had \"set race relations back in Louisville more than any single act in recent years.\"\n\nBut his influence hasn't made him immune to issues facing western Louisville.\n\n♦♦♦\n\nCosby was driving home Sept. 15 with his wife after helping host a Baptist conference called “The Illusion of Inclusion: 50 Years of Downward Mobility in Black America,” which included elected officials and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.\n\nAfter dropping a guest at a downtown hotel about 10 p.m., the couple saw blue lights flashing behind their Audi near Muhammad Ali Boulevard and 22nd Street. Officers approached on both sides, asking, “What are y'all getting into tonight?” and demanding both of their identifications.\n\n“My wife and I were thinking the same thing: That we had been profiled racially; that we had done nothing wrong to be stopped,” he said.\n\nRelated:Chief defends police tactics following concerns over aggressive patrols\n\nThe officer told them they’d been stopped for an improper turn and an illegal license plate frame and let them go with a warning. A police major later said it was not racial profiling and part of aggressive patrolling that had helped reduce crime.\n\nBut police later launched an internal investigation after Cosby dialed up the mayor. “Nobody else can just pull over and pick up the phone and call the mayor, because that’s what he did,” Barnetta Cosby said.\n\nCosby's daughter, Christine Cosby-Gaither, posted his video on Facebook, triggering outrage and media stories. She later gathered with other protesters to decry a “serious relationship problem” between the police and the black community. Cosby didn't attend.\n\n“Some thought he needed to more active or critical” or propose a specific policy change, Barnetta Cosby said. Others criticized him for acting the victim or making false claims of discrimination.\n\nIn a Courier Journal column, Cosby wrote, “Don’t treat a person like a criminal over a routine traffic stop and then wonder why a black person might conclude he has been racially profiled.”\n\nActivist Chanelle Helm of Black Lives Matter said the fact that it happened to Cosby drew needed attention to concerns about such stops. The mayor called for an honest discussion about a national history of disproportionate stops of African-Americans. But Helm said little had occurred since then to press for accountability on how such stops impact western Louisville residents.\n\nTo Cosby, who left his license plate frame on his car, the incident was just a symptom. Crime, race and policing will always clash in western Louisville while residents remain economically disadvantaged with little influence, he said.\n\n“If every cop was Mother Teresa, it would not fix the problem,” he said. “You will not change the police-community interaction as long as there is no capital circulating in the black community.\"\n\n♦♦♦\n\nCosby has learned from controversial comments he made in 2014 that seemed to undercut the Black Lives Matter protests emerging in the wake of police shootings.\n\n\"I'm not marching over hands up – don't shoot!' because we're the ones doing the shooting,\" Cosby said during a sermon, according to news reports. \"But I will march if you change it from 'Hands up – don't shoot!' to 'Books open – don't flunk!' \"\n\nAfter a backlash, he now says his remarks were a mistake, that he was too focused on institution building. “Protesting is necessary, and we should be protesting,\" he said.\n\nRicky Jones, a social justice commentator and professor of Pan-African studies at the University of Louisville, once clashed with Cosby on his approach. Now they are allies.\n\n“He was very adamant about us addressing internal challenges to the black community. Whereas I wanted to address the external challenges,” Jones said, recently tweeting a picture of them together saying, “In every good preacher, there’s a little professor; and in every good professor, there’s a little preacher!”\n\nCosby has caught flak at plenty of other times, too.\n\nIn the early 1990s, he supported scrapping court-ordered busing that kept schools integrated, saying black students had not benefited. In a 1993 Louisville Magazine story, Cosby said he'd been accused of supporting \"black separatism\" with a hostile, anti-white message.\n\nIn 1998, protesters booed him after he brought former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich to visit Simmons and accepted the help of Republican U.S. Rep. Anne Northup to get $1.6 million earmarked for Simmons.\n\n\"He’s never been afraid of controversy,” said F. Bruce Williams, pastor of Bates Memorial Baptist Church.\n\nMore recently, in 2016, some residents of the California neighborhood complained that Cosby ignored their concerns as they opposed a proposed methane plant because of fears over leaks and traffic.\n\nThey charged he did so because his church was promised it would have use of a building as part of the deal. It helped fuel distrust among some area residents, who say he's more worried about his legacy than the neighborhood. Some also have opposed as disruptive past and proposed street closures sought for the church or college.\n\nCosby today acknowledges he should have been more closely attuned to neighborhood concerns about the methane plant.\n\nMartina Kunnecke, a member of the Neighborhood Planning and Preservation group, said some neighbors also think too many homes are being bought up for the college and that some residents have felt pressured to sell, a charge Cosby denies.\n\nAnd Yolanda Walker, president-elect of the California Neighborhood Leadership Council Inc., said the benefits of Cosby’s institution-building rhetoric aren't evident outside his campuses.\n\n“I don’t see what he’s done other than build for himself,” she said.\n\nRead this:Simmons College wants to grow but some in West End don't trust its leader\n\nBut Mayor Fischer said he thinks Cosby has been a transformational figure and critical ally \"in the fight for progress in areas like increasing access to higher education and affordable housing, as well as racial reconciliation and equitable wealth building.”\n\nAnd Gerald Neal, a longtime state senator from western Louisville, said Cosby's constant preaching about racial inequalities has had tangible results.\n\nPassport Health CEO Mark Carter said he decided to build a $100 million headquarters, now under construction on West Broadway, after reading a Cosby’s column highlighting the absence of social capital and institutions. It will house more than 550 workers.\n\n“He hasn’t been without controversy. He has his detractors. But look at the bigger picture,\" Neal said. \"What would (west Louisville) look like without his work? He’s clearly institution building and moving those ideas closer to reality.\"\n\n♦♦♦\n\nDespite Cosby's abiding mission to teach anyone who will listen about what he sees as the roots of the black community's struggles, he is frustrated that the median net worth of white households is still 10 times that of African-American households and has grown since he began preaching.\n\n“That’s the number one thing America does not get about racism,” Cosby said, his voice rising. “They say we’ve reformed, so all of the Jim Crow laws are over. But the consequences are still with us. That’s why in every community where there are black people, we’re at the bottom.”\n\nCosby favors reparations for descendants of slaves in the form of education or housing benefits. He knows it's a tough sell today, more than five decades after the civil rights movement and after court battles over affirmative action. But he said the debt is still owed.\n\n\"Being colorblind means being history blind. Being history blind means being justice blind,\" he said.\n\nHe points with hope to a proposal by Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey that aims to close the racial wealth gap by giving lower-income youths a “baby bond” of up to $50,000 for wealth-building purchases such as a down payment on a home or college tuition. Locally, he is encouraged by new development and the city's recent efforts to revitalize parts of western Louisville. But, he said, \"just because there's development doesn't mean there is money in black pockets.\"\n\nIn 2015, Cosby was inducted into the Kentucky Gallery of Great Black Kentuckians. The following year, Lonnie Ali, the widow of Louisville boxing great Muhammad Ali, picked Cosby to eulogize her husband at his Louisville memorial. It was attended by such luminaries as President Bill Clinton and watched worldwide.\n\nCosby brought down the house with a rousing speech, praising Ali for “daring to love black people at a time when black people had a hard time loving themselves.\"\n\nLonnie Ali said she has long admired Cosby's social-justice voice and work in the California neighborhood.\n\n“Equality has come slower to many in our communities,\" she said. \"However, Dr. Cosby has led the way to expose the economic and societal adversities that many Louisvillians in the West End have to overcome on a daily basis.”\n\nFrom 2016:West Louisville needs some wins, Cosby writes\n\nCosby is still four years away from surpassing his grandfather's tenure at St. Stephen, with no plans to give up the helm of the church.\n\nAnd he showed no signs slowing down in a classroom at Simmons College recently, where he serves as a professor for a sociology class on race.\n\nAfter Cosby put his brimmed hat and coat on the desk, he led half a dozen students in prayer. He asked about the students' lives. Then he launched into his lesson, growing more animated as he went.\n\nRaising higher, catching fire.\n\n“Take this down,” he said, punctuating each word. “Racism is the maldistribution of wealth.”\n\nThe preacher was teaching again.\n\nReporter Chris Kenning can be reached at ckenning@gannett.com or 502-582-4307.

Limestone County farmer Donna Jo Curtis tells the Athens News-Courier she already has started feeding hay to her livestock because fields are so dry. Farm ponds also are drying up, making water a concern as excessive heat stresses the animals. To help with the crunch, state agriculture officials have announced a plan to issue special free permits for trucks hauling hay. Forecasters are predicting cooler temperatures and increasing chances of rain that could help even more. The entire state is at least abnormally dry, and some areas are in an extreme drought. The Alabama Cattlemen’s Association describes cattle production as a $2.5 billion industry in the state.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A Tlingit clan hat was welcomed back to southeast Alaska with ceremony and dance after spending more than a century away. A ceremony Sept. 25 included both an original sculpin hat, which was taken in 1884 from Sitka and became part of the Smithsonian Institution’s collection, and a replacement hat, which was given to the Kiks.adi clan. “It’s like seeing an old friend come around the corner when you thought you’d never see them again,” clan leader Ray Wilson told the Juneau Empire. The team-up and technology that led to the new hat and ceremony are unprecedented as far as the Smithsonian is aware. The replacement hat was made through careful study of the original, 3D imaging and consultation with the clan, said Eric Hollinger, tribal liaison for the repatriation office of the Smithsonian National History Museum.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A court-appointed expert in a lawsuit over the quality of health care in the state’s prisons says understaffing, inadequate funding and privatization of health care services are significant barriers in improving inmate care. The report released Friday comes as the state has been accused of persistently dragging its feet in recent years in following through on its promises in a 2014 settlement to improve health care for inmates. Expert Marc Stern says the state’s decision to privatize health care services for inmates is costing more than if the state ran those services itself. He recommended that the Legislature’s push for privatization of inmate care be rescinded or overridden by the judge so that the state can run those services again.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: Bacteria that can cause Legionnaire’s disease have been found in the showers of a Hot Springs spa. The Arkansas Department of Health says Legionella bacteria were found within Quapaw Baths & Spa, and the shower where water taken from a spring was cooled before use has been closed for cleaning. Legionnaire’s disease is a type of potentially fatal pneumonia but is treatable with antibiotics. The health department said it began investigating after three people with the disease reported staying at the spa. The department says thermal spring water at public fountains is safe while further testing continues. The spa said in a statement that it is cooperating with the department and asked for an investigation to determine the source of the contamination.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: At the end of the month, travelers will not be able to catch a rideshare or taxi outside terminals at Los Angeles International Airport. LAX announced Friday that passengers will instead have to take shuttles or walk to a special location outside the central terminal area where they can be picked up. The move is aimed at relieving congestion on the central road as construction picks up during a $14 billion improvement program. Ride-hailing vehicles and taxis will still be able to drop off passengers at terminals, but all pickups will be in the new location. Officials say that should remove about 15% of vehicle traffic from the central terminal area. The new system will remain in effect until a new automated people-mover goes into service in 2023.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Enrollment at Colorado State University this fall sets a record. University officials say total enrollment tops 34,000 students, up by about 2,000 compared to four years ago. The Loveland Reporter-Herald reports undergraduate enrollment is up from about 24,500 in 2015 to 26,500 now. At the Fort Collins campus, over 64% of new first-year students are Colorado residents, 57% are women, and 24% of the new class are first in their family to attend college. Total enrollment at CSU-Fort Collins, CSU Global and CSU-Pueblo tops 57,000 students.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials are launching a new health care cost-estimator tool. The Connecticut Office of Health Strategy has planned an event for Tuesday. The new cost estimator will be on the Healthscore CT website, which the office developed to give people free resources to make informed health care choices and policy decisions. The tool was designed to help residents compare what different health care providers charge for the same procedure. It’s part of the health strategy office’s effort to make cost and health care quality information more transparent and encourage providers to improve quality. Democratic Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and state lawmakers plan to attend Tuesday’s event at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Delawareans love novels, especially those filled with mystery and intrigue. The most popular book in the past six months was mystery novel “Where the Crawdads Sing” by Delia Owens, according to data from the Delaware Division of Libraries. Not only is “Crawdads” the most checked-out book, at 2,169 checkouts, but it’s also at the top of waitlists, with 1,111 Delawareans waiting to get their hands on the New York Times bestselling book. Brandywine Hundred Library manager Jean Kaufman says the book was checked out 206 times in the past six months at her library, with 201 people in line for a copy. “Where the Crawdads Sing” has been on the top of the New York Times bestsellers list for more than 20 nonconsecutive weeks.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. lawmakers are considering emergency legislation to prohibit district agencies from cooperating with federal immigration agencies unless provided a judicial warrant or order. WTOP-FM reports D.C. Council member Charles Allen proposed the legislation, saying a 2012 district act restricting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement isn’t enough anymore. Allen says the agency has adapted its practices to now request notification of release dates, in addition to or instead of requesting detainment. The council is set to review the proposed bill Tuesday. Prohibited assistance would include sharing information, complying with detainment requests and allowing federal immigration authorities to enter facilities owned by the district, which Mayor Muriel Bowser has declared a sanctuary city.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey Largo: A group of scuba divers submerged 30 feet beneath the surface to sculpt jack-o-lanterns during the annual Underwater Pumpkin Carving Contest in the Florida Keys. Detroit’s Josephine Walker and Stephanie McClary crafted moray eels embracing a heart to win the competition at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Other carvings included stingrays, an octopus, jellyfish, a “Protect Our Coral” message and traditional toothy grins. Participants used knives and fine carving tools to transform their orange gourds into sea creatures. They had to keep the naturally buoyant pumpkins from floating away while they carved.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: The University of Georgia has been seeking research proposals about the school’s history regarding slavery. University administrators say they’re committing $100,000 for the effort. The institution wants research from 1785, the year it was founded, to 1865, when the Civil War ended, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Some students, faculty, alumni and community leaders say the university should commit more money for the work. Some also think the time period of research should be extended beyond the Civil War. Colleges benefited from slavery after the Civil War through housing, zoning and educational policies that continued to discriminate against African Americans, said Kirt von Daacke, co-chair of the University of Virginia’s commission on slavery.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Maui will prohibit commercial activity in parks on Sundays and official holidays. The island’s Parks and Recreation Department said the changes to commercial permits will take place in about a month and reduce damage to parks, The Maui News reports. Commercial permits cover surfing, kayaking, scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding lessons, as well as snorkeling tours. “The demand on county parks has grown in recent years, as has the resident and visitor numbers,” permits officer Lisa Almeida said during a public hearing last week. The changes and public hearing followed televised comments Mayor Michael Victorino made in August announcing his intention to limit commercial activity in parks on Sundays and holidays.\n\nIdaho\n\nTwin Falls: A jail built to hold 194 is currently housing about 279 inmates – some crowded into an old trailer, others forced to sleep in plastic, boat-shaped containers lining the walls. The Times-News reports officials in Twin Falls County will ask voters in November to approve a $25 million bond to add modular units with 316 new beds to the jail. Capt. Doug Hughes says the overcrowding makes the jail dangerous for inmates and workers and makes it increasingly difficult to provide services to help inmates succeed once they are released. The county currently houses about 40 inmates in jails in other counties, which costs a little more than $1 million a year. Twin Falls County has not asked voters for a bond since the current jail facility was built in 1988.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials are holding public meetings for residents to weigh in on the sale of recreational marijuana. A new state law will allow recreational marijuana to be sold to people 21 and older starting Jan. 1. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says her office wants to hear from residents, business owners and others about where businesses that sell marijuana should be allowed to operate. Lightfoot introduced an ordinance last month to create Chicago’s first zoning regulations for marijuana sales. She’s proposing the city establish seven zones across Chicago and cap the number of dispensaries in each zone. The plan would ban sales in most of Chicago’s downtown and within 500 feet of a school. The meetings are planned for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State and federal data shows thousands of women are traveling out of state to terminate their pregnancies as abortion clinics close around Indiana and new laws restrict use of the procedure. While the number of abortions performed in the state declined by 14% between 2009 and 2017, the number of out-of-state abortions doubled. The data shows that more than 18,000 women crossed state lines during those years to get an abortion, predominantly to Illinois. That state has more abortion providers than Indiana, it does not ban abortions after 20 weeks, and the procedure is covered under Medicaid there. Abortion-rights advocates say women from Indiana are influenced by these factors to travel outside their communities to seek an abortion.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Republicans have chosen Rep. Pat Grassley to head their leadership teams as speaker-select of the Iowa House. The grandson of U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley was chosen by the GOP House caucus Monday. He takes over as speaker after a vote of the full House in January. Current Speaker Linda Upmeyer announced last week that she would step down as speaker but serve the remainder of her current House term through the end of 2020. Grassley, a 36-year-old farmer from New Hartford, was first elected to the House in 2006. He operates a family farm with his father and grandfather, who also served in the Iowa House from 1959 to 1975. Rep. Matt Windschitl was chosen majority leader and Rep. John Wills speaker pro tem.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: The federal Drug Enforcement Administration plans to reopen an office that closed two years ago in Garden City. The Kansas News Service reports the office is reopening at a time when methamphetamine seizures are increasing in Finney County, and some drug-related shootings have been reported in the area. Finney County is one of about a dozen Kansas counties that the DEA classifies as a high-intensity drug trafficking area. It isn’t clear when the office will open. William Callahan, special agent in charge of the DEA’s St. Louis Division, says a team of six agents, who have started working, will also monitor opioids. He says the amount of meth seized through August by the county’s drug task force more than doubled the amount for all of 2018.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A local Catholic church will declare itself a sanctuary in what its leaders say is a “public rejection of the brutal and racist policies” of President Donald Trump’s administration. Members of St. William Catholic Church will issue a statement on its sanctuary status Tuesday, describing the “deep faith traditions of providing sanctuary for those seeking assistance as well as what this will look like in our current political climate,” according to the church’s news release. St. William, founded in 1901 to serve Irish immigrants working in nearby railroad yards, has “long been committed to a social mission,” the release says. “But in 2017, as we witnessed the present administration’s increasingly racist rhetoric, tolerance for white supremacist terrorism, and encouragement of extreme enforcement by ICE and Border Patrol agents, it became clear to us that more was required.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: The United Daughters of the Confederacy says a monument that’s been ordered removed from in front of a courthouse is considered very fragile and could cost $1 million to be taken down safely. The UDC told KTSB-TV it hired an expert witness who says the 116-year-old statue outside Shreveport’s Caddo Parish Courthouse could fall apart if it isn’t moved carefully. They say the Mississippi Stone Guild found it would take nearly $1 million to properly move it. On Sept. 30, a planning committee recommended setting aside half of that in city funds if the group doesn’t move the monument itself by mid-November. The Shreveport Times reports UDC spokeswoman Jackie Nichols told the commission Thursday that the amount proposed isn’t enough and contends the group never said it would pay for the removal.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A scientist from the University of Maine will lead a new consortium that focuses on the sustainability of highly migratory fish species such as tuna and sharks. The Pelagic Ecosystem Research Consortium will be headed by UMaine’s Walt Golet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is providing $1.6 million to support the effort. The University of Maine says the consortium will focus on subjects such as reducing accidental catch of highly migratory fish and increasing the understanding of their life histories. Golet says study of the fish, which include economically valuable species such as swordfish, can help improve their conservation.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials and the owners of the historic racetrack that hosts the Preakness Stakes have reached an agreement to keep the Triple Crown series’ middle jewel in the city. The agreement, which is subject to approval of the General Assembly during its next session, ends a bitter dispute between owner The Stronach Group and the city over the future of Pimlico Race Course. Located in northwest Baltimore, the second-oldest track in America has been home to the famed annual race since 1909, but it is in need of a major overhaul, which has previously been estimated at nearly half a billion dollars. Under the plan, The Stronach Group would donate the site to the city for community development in and around the track and an area hospital. The company would also build a new clubhouse. The dilapidated grandstand would be demolished.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Experts say trees in the region are producing a lot of acorns this year. The Boston Globe reports experts say the region appears to be experiencing a “mast year.” Certain conditions, including the weather, cause the trees to produce more acorns every few years. Marjorie Rines, a naturalist with Mass Audubon, says there are “tons more around,” and they’ve been “coming down pretty hard and fast.” In Boston, some residents have contacted the city’s Constituent Service Center recently to ask that street sweepers clear acorns in their neighborhoods. Mark Ashton, a professor of forest ecology at Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says it is a mast year, but not a big one.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Ground is being broken for a park commemorating a half-century turnaround for a river that runs through the city’s industrial southwest side. Democratic U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell and Rashida Tlaib are among the dignitaries expected to attend Wednesday’s groundbreaking of the Fort Street Bridge Interpretive Park. The date, Oct. 9, also marks the 50th anniversary of a 1969 fire on the Rouge River. Sparks from an acetylene torch ignited oil and wooden debris in the river, sending flames high into the air. Organizers say the fire was among the catalysts for the Clean Water Act of 1972 and major watershed restoration efforts in the years since. Plans for the park include a sculpture, kayak launch, boardwalk, rain garden and walking path.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The local police union is selling “Cops for Trump” T-shirts after the police department banned officers from wearing their uniforms in support of candidates at political events or in ads. The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis has accused police administrators of instituting the new policy just days before President Donald Trump’s visit to Minneapolis. Union chief Bob Kroll says a lot of officers want to go to Thursday’s rally wearing their uniforms because Trump is a “very pro-law enforcement president.” The Star Tribune reports the police department denies the new policy has anything to do with politics and says it’s been under consideration since early this year. Kroll says the T-shirts are on sale for $20.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: An animal rights group wants Mississippi State to retire its live bulldog mascot named Jak after he was crashed into by an Auburn University player making a mad dash through the end zone. News outlets report People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has sent a letter to the Mississippi college, saying it was sheer luck that Jak wasn’t severely injured or killed in the clash with tailback JaTarvious Whitlow. Whitlow scored the first touchdown of the game, entering the end zone with a momentum that carried him past the goal line and out of bounds, where he crashed into Jak, who then briefly left the sidelines. Jak’s official Twitter account says his chin and right hind leg were bruised, and he’ll return to mascot duties this week.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State officials say welfare recipients with medical marijuana cards will continue to get financial aid. Social Services Department spokeswoman Rebecca Woelfel says the agency won’t cut off help to those who test positive for pot as long as they have medical marijuana cards. The policy comes after Missouri voters in 2018 said patients with cancer, epilepsy and other illnesses may use cannabis if they get doctor approval. That put those patients at odds with a state law that requires Temporary Assistance for Needy Families applicants to be screened for drug use. If participants are asked to take a drug test and either fail or don’t show up, they risk losing welfare benefits for three years. Missouri now exempts recipients with medical marijuana cards.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Montana GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte fielded calls for better management of grizzly bears during a weekend visit to the state’s Rocky Mountain Front. The Independent Record reports ranchers, farmers and residents urged the pair on Saturday to consider allowing hunting because of grizzly attacks on livestock and occasionally people. All said they supported removing grizzlies from protected status under the Endangered Species Act. Gianforte, too, urged Bernhardt to delist the bear and allow the state to manage the species. Last year, a federal judge in Montana restored threatened species status for about 700 bears in the three-state Yellowstone region. Opponents of delisting cite a need for allowing populations in that region and the north to converge.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The official state insect, the honeybee, is feeling the sting of agricultural chemicals, unfavorable weather, flooding and mites, according to beekeepers big and small. Keeping bees here has been so challenging lately that U.S. commercial beekeeping giant Adee Honey Farms recently gave up on Nebraska as a place to put hives during the summer. The company, which has almost 82,000 hives and trucks hives across the country to pollinate fruit and vegetables, had kept 12,000 hives in Nebraska – almost 500 million bees. At one time, Nebraska was the company’s top honey-producing state, according to the Omaha World-Herald. With its open ranges and river bottoms, Nebraska offered prime locations for bees to rest, recuperate and make honey. This year, the company put no hives here. Its bee losses in the state were 82% last year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a $10,000 cash drop from a helicopter over a soccer match last month. The Skyline Helicopter Tours chopper descended from the night sky Sept. 7 and hovered above 200 people gathered on the Cashman Field. The crowd looked up, and within seconds, streams of cold, hard cash shot from the helicopter’s belly and sent the people below scrambling to get their take. The cash drop that unfolded during halftime of the Las Vegas Lights soccer team’s home loss to the El Paso Locomotive is now the center of an FAA investigation to determine whether the pilot endangered people. Representatives from Skyline Helicopter Tours – known for its Strip and Hoover Dam flights – did not respond to requests for comment, but Las Vegas Lights owner Brett Lashbrook said he fully supports the promotion and how it worked.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nEffingham: A building founded as a school by the Masons has been named to the National Register of Historic Places. Built in Effingham in 1858, the two-and-a-half-story New England Masonic Charitable Institute has Italianate details. The building’s three-stage tower has a Masonic seal on the front and clock faces on the two adjacent sides. Its octagonal open belfry protects the 1863 bell, which was used during World War II for air-raid warnings. The New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources says the institute is the only school in the United States known to have been run by the Masons. It opened as a school in 1861 and ceased school operations in the early 1880s. The town library now occupies the first floor.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBergenfield: The state’s public schools will have to test their water for lead twice as often as they do now and share the results on a yet-to-be-created state database under guidelines announced Monday by officials. The announcement continues a series of measures catalyzed by the recent water crisis in Newark, where residents in 14,000 homes with lead pipes have been given bottled water since mid-August after limited tests showed some filters weren’t adequately reducing lead levels. Lead in drinking water has been linked to developmental delays in children and can damage the brain, red blood cells and kidneys. The Legislature is holding hearings, and the state Department of Environmental Protection is stepping up its inventory of lead pipes in water systems around the state, a process that started earlier in the year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A state high school sports governing board says unruly fans creating problems in football, cheerleading and basketball are threatening the future of soccer. The Albuquerque Journal reports New Mexico Activities Association recently announced that soccer games are being canceled and the sport is losing officials due to parental behavior. New Mexico Activities Association Executive Director Sally Marquez described the situation as a “crisis” in a letter to coaches and athletic directors. She says the cussing, screaming and threats have to stop. The governing board said in April it was considering canceling next year’s cheerleading State Spirit Competition following death threats and inflammatory social media posts.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An upcoming exhibit at the New York Public Library will offer a look into the very private life of J.D. Salinger. From Oct. 18 to Jan. 20, 2020, the library will show materials ranging from family photographs to letters to the original typescript for his classic “The Catcher in the Rye.” The exhibit is called “J.D. Salinger” and was organized by the library in partnership with the author’s widow, Colleen Salinger, and son, Matt Salinger. Matt Salinger said that while he plans to release his father’s unpublished writings at some point, the library will not be showing any unpublished material. J.D. Salinger, who died in 2010, published no books after the 1960s but continued to write during the following decades. Fans have long obsessed over what he had been working on. The exhibit will help mark the 100th anniversary of Salinger’s birth.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Class is finally back in session on an island that was severely damaged by Hurricane Dorian. WITN reports classes for students on Ocracoke Island were being held Monday in three different and temporary locations as repairs continue. Start and end times are staggered to help families who may need to go to multiple school locations. Last week, Hyde County School Superintendent Stephen Basnight, who oversees Ocracoke School, told the board the community remains “devastated.” Ocracoke School was flooded with more than 3 feet of water. Basnight said the gym is still a pond, and expensive equipment in other rooms remains damaged. Students have been taking classes online with iPads from the state for the past month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: University of North Dakota officials have broken ground on a new, $80 million Memorial Union. Groundbreaking was held outside UND’s School of Law during homecoming Friday. UND interim President Joshua Wynne says the new Memorial Union will be “the gateway” to the entire university in Grand Forks. Students voted last November in favor of replacing the school’s aging student union by raising student fees to support construction and upkeep of a new building. The new Memorial Union is scheduled for completion in 2021. The three-story building will feature 158,000 square feet of meeting and engagement spaces and include up-to-date technology, student services, and expanded dining and retail options.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A City Council member wants to prohibit discrimination against natural hair and hairstyles associated with race. City Councilman Chris Seelbach has proposed that natural hair be added to Cincinnati’s discrimination policy. Seelbach says people of color have been forced to regard popular natural hairstyles such as cornrows or dreadlocks as liabilities in the workplace, housing and elsewhere. He says black women are especially penalized. The proposed law would call for the city to investigate complaints of discrimination and allow fines of up to $1,000. A public discussion on the issue with the Cincinnati City Council’s Arts, Youth & Inclusion committee is scheduled for Tuesday. The full council is expected to vote Wednesday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Zac Hanson of the pop music band Hanson is recovering following a motorcycle crash in the state last week. The 33-year-old Hanson said in posts on Twitter, Facebook and the Tulsa-based band’s website that he is recovering after suffering a broken collarbone, three broken ribs and a cracked scapula. Hanson said he was able to walk away from the Tulsa crash thanks to “good quality protective gear.” Details of the crash were not revealed, but Hanson said he was preparing for a cross-country ride. Hanson said he will be replaced as drummer during an upcoming tour but will sing. Hanson is the youngest of three brothers who formed the band in the early 1990s. The band is best known for the song “MMMBop.”\n\nOregon\n\nCanby: An area creamery is working with a distiller to turn whey into vodka. KOIN-TV reports TMK Creamery, near Canby, is working with Jason Greenwood of Divine Distillers of Salem on the venture. Greenwood says whey-based vodka is not common. He says they have been working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Oregon State University to “perfect” the process. According to the university, most milk that goes into a cheese-making facility comes out as whey, which it says can be expensive to dispose of in landfills. The university says turning whey into protein powders or related products requires equipment that can be too expensive for small creameries. TMK Creamery’s Todd Koch says the hope is to be selling bottles of the vodka by month’s end.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDanville: A hospital says it is transferring some infants following a bacterial infection in its neonatal intensive care unit that affected eight newborns, three of whom have died. Geisinger Medical Center in Danville said Monday that four of the babies have recovered, and one is still being treated with antibiotics. The hospital said all of the babies had been born prematurely, and the three deaths “may have been a result of the infection complicating their already vulnerable state due to extreme prematurity.” Officials say they are working with state and federal health authorities to make sure the pseudomonas waterborne bacterial infection has been eradicated. As a precaution, the hospital is transferring babies born at less than 32 weeks to other hospitals and diverting other expected premature deliveries.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNarragansett: The American Civil Liberties Union says the town shouldn’t prohibit attendees at town meetings from interrupting, making slanderous remarks and behaving boisterously. The Narragansett Town Council is considering asking the town solicitor to draft a “decorum ordinance,” similar to new rules approved in Exeter last month. The Rhode Island ACLU chapter said Monday that considering such a proposal sends the wrong message and would have a “chilling effect” on Narragansett residents and their willingness to speak their minds at open forum sessions of council meetings. The ACLU says other municipalities shouldn’t follow Exeter’s “questionable lead.” The Narragansett council president’s recommendation for drafting the ordinance states it would ensure that First Amendment rights are protected while keeping town meetings civil.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A large amount of land along the Savannah River is being protected from development. Jonathan Winthrop told The Post and Courier of Charleston that his family put the 13,868 acres near Allendale into a conservation easement because they love the wilderness and didn’t want to see it compromised. Nature Conservancy Coastal and Midlands Conservation Director David Bishop says the latest gift means 60 continuous miles along the Savannah River are protected. The value of the donated land was not disclosed. The land was part of a plantation before the Revolutionary War, and the Winthrop family has owned it since 1906. It’s been used to harvest timber, as a vacation retreat and for quail hunting.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The estimated number of violent crimes is down in the state. U.S. Attorney Ron Parsons said Friday that the newly released FBI crime report shows the number of violent crimes in South Dakota in 2018 dropped for the first time in five years, declining about 5% compared to the year before. The report shows the estimated rate of violent crime in the state was about 405 offenses per 100,000 residents. The most dramatic drop was in the number of murders and non-negligent homicides, which dropped 56% from 2017 to 2018. Nationally, the estimated number of violent crimes as a whole decreased 3.3% in 2018 from the prior year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Nashville Film Festival turns 50 this year with a new director who is expanding its footprint. WPLN-FM reports the festival directed by Jason Padgitt now includes city events every night as well as a new festival hub away from the multiplex where the movies are shown. Events range from house parties for VIP badge holders to big public celebrations, like one for a Chuck Berry documentary’s world premiere. New film programming manager Lauren Ponto says she maintained the festival’s eclectic mix of foreign titles and independent American films. She’s also showcasing more local talent, including K.D. Amond, director of “Five Women in the End.” It’s an apocalyptic thriller about a girls’ night gone wrong making its world premiere in the Tennessee First Competition. The festival runs through Saturday.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. is requesting an independent investigation into the fatal shooting of a key witness in a police officer’s murder trial days after the officer’s conviction. In a statement Sunday, the LDF called the killing Friday of Joshua Brown “deeply alarming and highly suspicious.” Sherrilyn Ifill, the group’s president, said Brown’s death under such circumstances “cries out for answers.” Meanwhile, Mayor Eric Johnson is urging people to avoid speculation about Brown’s death. He says he believes the police will conduct a thorough investigation. Amber Guyger was convicted last week of murder in the death of her upstairs neighbor, Botham Jean, whose apartment she said she mistook for her own. Brown testified that on the night of the killing, he heard what sounded like “two people meeting by surprise” and then two gunshots.\n\nUtah\n\nCottonwood Heights: More than a year after she set her mind to do more to help the environment, a Utah fourth grader has convinced her elementary school to switch from foam trays to biodegradable ones. The Deseret News reports Aggy Deagle successfully lobbied the Canyons School Board and inspired other schools to consider making the change. Deagle says she hated watching the trays go in the trash. Other students joined Deagle’s effort and helped her collect signatures from about 85% of the school’s students on a petition urging the change. The school district has also switched from plastic utensils to reusable metal ones. These changes have increased the nutritional services budget by about $200,000. Butler Elementary School Principal Jeff Nalwalker calls the change a “pretty big deal.”\n\nVermont\n\nNorth Hero: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife is looking for help from the public in preparing some Lake Champlain beaches for nesting turtles. The year’s spiny softshell turtle beach cleanup day is Saturday, Oct. 26. Volunteers will pull up vegetation to prepare beach nesting sites for next year. The volunteers may also find a few hatchlings that remain in underground nests late in the year. In addition to threatened spiny softshell turtles, these nest sites are also used by map turtles, painted turtles and snapping turtles. Fish and Wildlife biologist Toni Mikula will have hatchling spiny softshell and other turtles on hand and will talk about the long-term turtle recovery efforts.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: A row house that once housed one of the nation’s largest slave-trading businesses is up for sale. The Northern Virginia Urban League owns the home in Old Town Alexandria and operates it as a museum called Freedom House. News outlets report the league put the building up for sale to shed the financial burden of operating a lightly attended museum in an old building with high maintenance costs. City officials say they’d prefer the building not be sold to a private entity, but Alexandria is not in position to take over the museum’s operation. Slave traders used the building as a holding pen for several decades in the 19th century to keep slaves arriving through the city’s port until they were sold into the Deep South.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: Hop, apple and wine growers in the state have announced they are expecting to at least meet production levels from last year’s fall harvests. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports crop experts have prepared to meet hop and wine grape numbers from 2018 while surpassing apple production levels. Growers say apple harvest numbers will be available this week, and it is likely the harvest could bring in close to 137 million boxes, an 18% increase. Washington Tree Fruit Association says the expected number does not include apples processed into juice or other products. Experts say hop numbers could be close to the 107 million pounds harvested last year. Experts say grape numbers are also expected to be similar to 2018 with more than 260,000 tons harvested.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWilliamson: Officials say state and local workers and volunteers have removed thousands of tires from a stretch of the Tug Fork River. Employees of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, with volunteers and employees from the city of Williamson and the Mingo County Commission removed 2,340 tires from a 100-yard stretch of the river over four days. An agency statement says eight volunteers logged 192 hours during the cleanup from Sept. 26 to Oct. 2. The department says tires were rolled into the river for decades, and they accumulated behind a school, possibly as a result of flooding some 40 years ago. An estimated 10,000 tires still await removal, and plans are underway for another cleanup next year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin’s regents are preparing to take another step toward implementing punishments for students who interfere with campus speeches. The regents in 2017 adopted a policy declaring that students who twice disrupt others’ free speech would be suspended for at least one semester. A third offense would mean expulsion. The policy hasn’t taken effect, however, because the UW System’s administrative rules haven’t been amended to include it. The Board of Regents plans to vote during a meeting Friday at UW-Superior to approve a scope statement outlining such an amendment. Approval would authorize UW officials to begin drafting the language incorporating the policy changes into rule.\n\nWyoming\n\nChugwater: A former Peacekeeper missile alert facility has been dedicated as Wyoming’s newest state historical site. The Wyoming Tribune-Eagle reports officials dedicated the site, 30 miles north of Cheyenne, on Saturday. F.E. Warren Air Force Base personnel operated the MX intercontinental ballistic missile facility from 1986 to 2005. Visitors can tour on-site living quarters and take an elevator 60 feet underground to see its guidance systems. Officials worked with Wyoming State Parks and the State Historic Preservation Office to prepare the public display.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/10/wave-undie-run-undone-florida-man-series-news-around-states/39466837/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Lawmakers postponed a vote on a proposed abortion ban Thursday after anger erupted in the state Senate when some Republicans stripped an exception for rape and incest from the bill. Shouting broke out among senators when the exemption was removed without a roll call vote. Democrats and some Republicans objected to the change to the bill, which would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony, being gaveled through quickly. Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh suggested lawmakers go home for the weekend to cool off and resume debate Tuesday. Marsh said he supports an exemption for rape and wants a roll call vote on the matter next week. The anger underscored tensions over the proposal that would become the most stringent abortion restriction in the country if approved.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Eight conservation groups sued Tuesday to stop the largest sale of Alaska old growth timber in decades, claiming the U.S. Forest Service violated environmental policy and its own management plan for the Tongass National Forest with the sale. The agency’s plan is to harvest as much as 225 million board feet of old growth timber from Prince of Wales Island. The Forest Service didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason, who has dealt two setbacks to the Trump administration this year. She found that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when reversing bans on offshore drilling and that the administration violated federal law with a proposed road that would split a wilderness area in a national wildlife refuge.\n\nArizona\n\nMarble Canyon: One of the most exclusive and dramatic hiking spots in the Southwest could see bigger crowds under a new proposal unveiled Wednesday. The Bureau of Land Management is weighing increasing its daily visitor limits from 20 to 96 people a day at The Wave, a popular rock formation near the Arizona-Utah border. A 6-mile round-trip hike through tall sandstone buttes and sage brush is required to get to the Wave, a wide, sloping basin of searing reds, oranges and yellows in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument. The agency is asking for public comment, and changes could be implemented as soon as October, agency official Mike Herder says. Visitors compete for permits in a monthly online lottery and at daily walk-in drawings. Less than 5% of the 150,000 people who wanted to hike the trail last year were actually able to do it, according to federal data.\n\nArkansas\n\nBatesville: A juvenile detention facility synonymous with neglect and abuse is to be shuttered and the building transformed into a treatment center for sex trafficking survivors, officials say. White River Regional Juvenile Detention Center will close by this summer, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Jonathan Pickering, facility director, says the new center will provide youths who were forced into the sex trade with at least three individual and three group therapy sessions a week. Pickering says families can join the sessions too, and staff will arrange transportation if necessary. The facility has a storied history. In April, a former White River jailer was sentenced to seven years in prison for what a judge called “sadistic and completely unjustified” punishments for disorderly juveniles. Another was imprisoned in March for violating youths’ rights and falsifying documents.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo has two new arrivals: a pair of endangered African penguin chicks. The zoo announced Wednesday that the fluffy chicks – named Doug and Barbara in honor of Douglas G. Myers, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Global, and his wife, Barbara Myers – hatched two months ago. The eggs came from two breeding couples. The zoo says it’s the first time eggs laid by its adult penguins have hatched there. Staffers have been working with the chicks to get them used to humans before they are introduced into the penguin colony in the next few weeks. African penguins are an endangered species. Their numbers have dropped by more than 60% in the past three decades, and only 23,000 breeding pairs are known to exist. The decline is blamed on several factors, including disease, habitat destruction, and lack of food from overfishing, climate change and pollution.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The end-of-semester Undie Run at Colorado State University started innocently enough, with a few hundred participants in their skivvies and a handful of clothes-filled trash bags carted off to Goodwill, according to its first student organizer. But more than a decade later, CSU is putting its foot down, taking its hardest stance yet against an event it now says is characterized by public intoxication and rampant sexual misconduct. Its message – in a letter distributed to students, emailed to parents and printed in multiple full-page ads in the campus newspaper – is clear: “The university will not allow the ‘undie run’ to take place this year.” The run, which has never been sanctioned or supported by CSU, has sprung up every spring since 2008 thanks to Facebook groups led by largely unnamed organizers and campus word-of-mouth. It’s typically held on the last day of classes before finals week, which for this semester is Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has voted to incrementally increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023, following a marathon, overnight debate. Weary lawmakers advanced the bill to the Senate, 85-59, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition, shortly after noon Thursday. The occasionally contentious debate, which began about 10 p.m. Wednesday, was wrapped by New Haven Rep. Robyn Porter, the Democratic House chairwoman of the General Assembly’s Labor Committee. Referencing her own early struggles as a divorced mother of two, Porter said the wage increase will help those who “don’t have two nickels to rub together” and feel like $10 is $100. But Republicans warned the wage increase will harm an already fragile state economy and lead to job reductions and more automation.\n\nDelaware\n\nMilford: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, one of the state’s best-known businesses, announced Thursday that it is merging with Boston Beer Co., the makers of Sam Adams beer and Angry Orchard hard cider. The merger, valued at about $300 million, is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2019, subject to closing conditions. It’s a stunning turn of events for the Milford-based, independent brewery founded by Sam Calagione, a Massachusetts native, and his wife Mariah, who was born in Delaware. Dogfish Head plans to retain its name and will still be a craft brewery, according to a press release sent out Thursday. The brewery began in Rehoboth Beach in 1995 as a “nanobrewery.” As the company grew, brewing moved to its current Milton site. The brewery and the tasting room have since become one of Delaware’s top tourist destinations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chair of the City Council has proposed an amendment to the city’s 2020 budget that would severely limit access to public records. The Washington Post reports the legislation would allow the city to reject record requests that don’t include specifications about the sought documents, including the subject matter, names of senders and recipients, and a date range. It would only permit the disclosure of information “regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.” Chairman Phil Mendelson says the Freedom of Information Act “wasn’t intended for fishing expeditions.” His proposal comes after the newspaper requested email records through FOIA and found that Councilman Jack Evans used his government email to pitch himself to area lobbyists.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show. Oxygen Media, which in 2017 announced a full-time shift to true-crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on “America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State” has been added to its projects. There is no premiere date for the show. The series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films “Get Out,” “The Purge” and “Insidious.” With the working title of “Florida Man,” the series will “unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension,” Oxygen officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s law enforcement will have to preserve rape kits for much longer than what was previously required under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this week. Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb, the bill’s main supporter, says the DNA evidence in the rape kits will help solve cold cases and pursue justice for survivors of sexual violence. Previously, Georgia only required rape kits to be stored for 10 years. The new law requires the state to preserve the evidence 30 years after the arrest date or seven years from the completion of a prison sentence, whichever occurs later. If there are no arrests, the kit must be stored for 50 years. Holcomb also authored a 2016 law that helped cut down on the state’s backlog of rape kits.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Federal officials are asking the public to give adequate space to a monk seal that has been resting on a Waikiki beach. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that the female seal identified as 8-year-old Kaiwi has come onto the beach in Honolulu four times in recent days. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species protected by state and federal laws that typically forages at night and “hauls up” to rest on beaches during the day. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials ask members of the public in the high-traffic area to remain behind barriers set up to protect the seal. Officials say Kaiwi has previously given birth to pups in south and east Oahu. Although she does not appear pregnant at this time, it is possible.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State agencies are racing to beat a Friday deadline to keep alive thousands of administrative rules after the Legislature’s House of Representatives in April killed a bill reauthorizing them. Republican Gov. Brad Little directed state agencies to submit temporary and pending rules by Friday to be vetted before publication in a special Idaho Administrative Bulletin on June 19. A 21-day public comment period follows before the rules can attain temporary status by July 1 and remain in effect. Many state agencies have started the process, and on Wednesday the Idaho Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in a special meeting voted 4-0 to authorize the Idaho Department of Lands to initiate temporary rulemaking on the agency’s oil and gas regulations.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Plans are in the works to open a visitors’ center for the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Laurent House, which opened as a museum four years ago. The Rockford Register Star reports the Laurent House Foundation plans to renovate dilapidated properties across the street from the home. It will offer a visitors’ center and gift shop and have offices and parking. Private donations are funding the $500,000 project. An estimated 2,000 people toured the home last year, and it has attracted visitors from Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom. The 2,600-square-foot Laurent House, built in the early 1950s, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It’s the only house Wright designed specifically for someone with disabilities. The foundation won approval Monday from the Rockford City Council to annex the properties.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Sports betting will become legal and construction of two new casinos will be allowed in the state under a bill signed by the governor Wednesday. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb endorsed the bill on his final day to act on the measure approved by lawmakers after they reached a deal in the final hours of this year’s legislative session. So far this year, Indiana joins Montana and Tennessee in moving to legalize sports wagering after six other states moved quickly following a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing it nationwide last year. Indiana sports wagering could start in September. Bets could be placed by anyone 21 or older at a casino or by mobile devices after a bettor has registered with an Indiana casino. Holcomb says the state’s casino industry has faced greater competition as neighboring states have legalized more forms of gambling.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: In an effort to help the environment without skimping on photographic fun, the University of Iowa Pentacrest Museums, made up of the Old Capitol Museum and the Museum of Natural History, have made an enticing offer for graduates. Confetti has always been a part of graduations, but the museum group wants it to become a thing of the past, posting on its Facebook page that it’s ready to digitally alter graduation photos to add confetti. The post asked students to consider that “many kinds of confetti are not biodegradable and are a health risk to our wildlife.” Interested students can message the Facebook page directly or email jessica-smith-7@uiowa.edu to send their photos to a museum designer.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A new government report says the state’s winter wheat crop is maturing more slowly than usual. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported this week that about 14% of the wheat has now headed. That is near what it was a year ago but well behind the 41% average for the date. The agency also rated wheat condition as 10% poor to very poor, 32% in fair shape, and 58% in good to excellent condition. Growers have also seeded about 41% of their corn acreage, behind the 51% that is normally in the ground by this time. Planting of soybean and sorghum crops in Kansas is just getting underway, with progress at or near the average.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s re-election campaign is capitalizing on a fellow Republican’s attack, selling “Cocaine Mitch” shirts on his campaign’s website. The shirts appear to have been hot sellers. The Kentucky Republican’s campaign Twitter account said Wednesday that McConnell was closing in on one of his biggest fundraising days of the year and thanked people who chipped in by purchasing shirts. The shirt shows a faceless figure with a sprinkling of cocaine on the side. It says “Mitch” on the front and “cartel member” on the back. The Senate leader’s campaign is laughing off an attack by ex-coal executive and failed Senate candidate Don Blankenship, who called him “Cocaine Mitch” after a magazine article alleged drugs were found aboard a cargo ship owned by the family of McConnell’s wife, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to exempt diapers and tampons from the state sales tax stalled Wednesday in the Senate, only to be revived later in a different form and successfully sent to the House for debate. Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat, proposed a constitutional change to remove the 4.45% state sales tax from diapers and feminine hygiene products starting in 2021. Senators refused to include that exemption in the state constitution. The Senate voted 21-12 for the measure, but it needed 26 votes to pass because constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote. But later in the day, after stymieing the constitutional change, senators agreed to include the tax break in statute. That law change passed in a 29-5 vote, moving to the House for consideration. Morrell said the items are essential to women and children, in line with prescription drugs, which are exempt from sales tax.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor is bringing back the state’s Children’s Cabinet in hopes of reducing youth drop-out, recidivism and incarceration rates. Gov. Janet Mills says in a Thursday announcement that she wants to focus on helping Maine children succeed in school, enter the workforce and live healthy lives. The governor says 37 towns of the top 50 with the highest poverty rates in New England in 2010 were located in Maine. She says 1 in 6 Maine children is living in poverty. The Children’s Cabinet dates back to 1996 and last met in 2010. The cabinet has urged Maine to expand quality and accessible early child care and education. Mills also wants to address the number of children suffering substantiated child abuse, which is up 25% from 2017 to 2018.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Some Marylanders are at risk of having their driver’s licenses or identification cards recalled next month if they don’t soon satisfy document requirements that are part of the federally mandated Real ID process, according to a state agency. Some residents who have the new Real ID card still must bring in certain documentation to comply with the federal REAL ID requirement, according to a Thursday news release from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. The overall deadline for obtaining a Real ID is Oct. 1, 2020, but more than 66,300 people with a new Real ID star license or identification card have not yet filed the required documents, the release says. Without action, MVA says, administrators will start flagging the affected driver’s licenses and identification cards in June as “recalled,” which would result in confiscation if drivers get pulled over.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDartmouth: The federal government says a program that sells scallops to pay for marine science will include a study of how shellfish harvesting affects sea turtles in this year’s projects. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the Atlantic Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside will help pay for 13 projects in 2019 and 2020. Regulators use the program to set aside more than a million pounds of scallops, generating millions of dollars for the science projects. Fishermen and scientists collaborate on the program. This year’s awards include a pair to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to use underwater cameras to get a better handle on East Coast scallop population health. The award to study sea turtles is slated to go to the Coonamessett Farm Foundation and Roger Williams University.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: There’s one more sign a riverfront concert venue has been renamed after Aretha Franklin. Workers on Thursday were taking down the Chene Park sign outside the venue and putting up one reflecting the name change. It features a stylized signature of the Queen of Soul’s first name. Mayor Mike Duggan told mourners at Franklin’s funeral in August that the name would be changed to Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre, saying that “when Aretha Franklin sang, it sounded like the voice of Detroit.” Days later, City Council unanimously approved it. The facility is known for its outdoor stage and summer concerts, and it hosted a Franklin tribute show last summer. She performed at Chene Park in 2015 to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The 2019 season starts in June. Franklin died Aug. 16 at 76.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Lawmakers are trying to get their hands around skyrocketing drug costs and the pharmaceutical industry that sets the prices. Bills are moving to tackle the problem, from anti-price gouging efforts to new reporting requirements for drug companies when prices spike. Minnesota Public Radio reports that nearly all those bills have been tucked into House and Senate budget bills and are heading into final negotiations. The bipartisan push has been fueled by personal stories. Nicole Smith-Holt has been a regular around the Capitol, talking about her son Alec Smith, a diabetic who died at age 26 because he was rationing insulin that he couldn’t afford. Both the House and Senate health and human services budgets include assistance for emergency insulin supplies, but their different approaches need to be reconciled.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A police officer helped a driver out of a wrecked sports car and told the man he was “lucky to be alive.” Less than an hour later, the officer was killed by another person who walked up and shot him outside the police station. Biloxi police records show Patrolman Robert McKeithen responded to a crash Sunday night and then returned to the station because he had gotten a flat tire. The driver, Damon Corrigan, 22, told the Sun Herald that McKeithen also accompanied him to a hospital. He says he was shocked to learn the officer had been killed. “The only thing I remember him telling me was that I was so lucky to be alive,” Corrigan told the newspaper. “He was so nice. I felt so bad.” McKeithen, 57, had worked for Biloxi Police Department for almost 24 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republicans in the state House are backing away from a budget compromise that would allow colleges and universities to charge in-state tuition to students living in the country illegally. The GOP-led House on Thursday voted 110-43 against the deal. That means a panel of lawmakers will get another shot to negotiate on the policy and the proposed state budget for public colleges and universities. Missouri schools currently face losing state funding if they offer those students anything less than the tuition rate charged to international students. Bipartisan Senate and House negotiators earlier this week agreed to end that policy. But opposition from House Republicans could unravel the deal. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass the budget.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock has signed a bill to continue the state’s Medicaid expansion program for another six years, as long as federal funding continues. He was joined at Thursday’s signing ceremony by bill sponsor Republican Rep. Ed Buttrey and Democratic Rep. Mary Caferro, who sponsored a separate bill that did not pass. The program provides health insurance to about 95,000 low-income adults. Buttrey’s bill adds work requirements, strengthens an asset test and increases premiums for people who stay on the program for more than two years. Bullock on Thursday also vetoed a bill that sought to give regulatory backing to insurance companies so they could negotiate better contracts with pharmacy benefit managers for policies sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Bullock argued the legislation could lead to higher costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A judge is considering his verdict in a lawsuit that says six convenience stores along Interstate 80 in the state posted misleading signs about prices. A nonjury trial was held last in week in Lincoln in a February 2017 lawsuit filed by several individuals and the Coalition for Ethical Petroleum Marketing. It accuses North Platte-based Wilkinson Development of violating the Nebraska Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act. Wilkinson is accused of advertising low prices to attract travelers to its Fat Dog stores but then selling gas at those prices only at a limited number of pumps, intentionally hoping travelers accidentally filled up with more expensive fuel. The company president has denied the accusation.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An unusually wet stretch of showers and thunderstorms may help Sin City surpass its yearly average for rainfall this week. And it’s not even monsoon season yet. Since January, the National Weather Service has logged 3.8 inches of rainfall in Las Vegas – a few thimbles away from the yearly average of 4.19 inches. “Getting over (4.19 inches) isn’t impossible,” says meteorologist Kate Guillet. “We’re just going to have to wait and see.” The National Weather Service estimates a quarter to a half an inch of rain could fall on the Las Vegas Valley between Thursday and Sunday – and higher amounts are possible.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: As some states and communities have slowly begun to acknowledge their often purposeful erasure of Native Americans from the dominant narrative, the voices, cultures and histories of the Abenaki and Wabanaki peoples were recently given a rightful home in the oldest “neighborhood” settled by Europeans in what’s now the state of New Hampshire. “People of the Dawnland,” an exhibit at the Jones House Family Discover Center in the 1600s Puddle Dock neighborhood, opens this month. The neighborhood, now known as the outdoor Strawbery Banke Museum, did in fact have remnants of indigenous people, such as pottery, projectile points and tent holes, discovered by archaeologists, but the museum has previously largely focused its efforts on the colonial aspects of the early settlement.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s beaches, casinos, forests and cities attracted tourists who spent nearly $45 billion last year. Gov. Phil Murphy says tourism spending in New Jersey has increased for nine years in a row. Speaking at a tourism conference Thursday in Trenton, Murphy said the tourism industry generated $5 billion in state and local taxes in 2018. He said about 111 million people visited the Garden State last year, up more than 7% from the previous year. Tourism is the state’s seventh-largest industry, supporting nearly 334,000 jobs. When indirect jobs, such as those that supply the industry, are included, the figure rises to more than 531,000 jobs. Food and beverages and lodging accounted for the largest share of tourism spending.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: World-premiere operas derived from the gender-bending Broadway hit “M. Butterfly” and from meditations on Victorian-era repression in Bram Stroker’s “Dracula” are coming to the Santa Fe Opera and its open-air stage in the high desert. Opera General Director Robert Meya on Wednesday announced upcoming productions for 2020 that include retooled staples such as “Il Barbiere di Siviglia” (“The Barber of Seville”) and the revival of Tim Albery’s version of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” (“The Magic Flute”). In recent years, Santa Fe has been the backdrop for productions about the dawn of the nuclear age in 1940s New Mexico and a world premiere of a techno-infused opera about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been a regular visitor to performances in Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Anna Sorokin, the German con artist who passed herself off as a wealthy heiress to swindle banks, hotels and friends, was sentenced Thursday to four to 12 years behind bars. New York Judge Diane Kiesel said at the sentencing hearing that she was “stunned by the depth of the defendant’s deception” and turned down a request by Sorokin’s lawyers that she be sentenced to time she has already spent in jail awaiting trial. Sorkin, 28, was convicted last month on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services and has been in custody since her October 2017 arrest. Sorokin went by Anna Delvey when she defrauded financial institutions and Manhattan celebrity circles into believing she had a fortune of about $67 million overseas that could cover her jet-setting lifestyle, high-end clothing and lavish hotel stays.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMurphy: The U.S. Forest Service is proposing one of the largest timber sales in the nearly 100-year history of the Nantahala National Forest, and the public comment period ends Friday. The proposal, known as the Buck Project, is drawing concern from conservation groups worried about harmful effects of logging and road building in this “special place” of potential wilderness and old-growth areas. But it is being welcomed by others who say it will improve forest health and wildlife habitat in forest areas long overdue for a trim. The Buck Project, which includes a timber sale as well as forest restoration activities including prescribed burns and stream improvement projects, would take place in a 20,638-acre analysis area in southeastern Clay County, in the Tusquitee Ranger District of Nantahala, the state’s largest and most western forest.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner says lawmakers may be called back into session over legislation that limits the powers of the state auditor. The Legislature passed a measure late in the session that requires the auditor’s office to get lawmakers’ permission to conduct “performance audits.” The amendment was put in the auditor’s budget that passed unanimously in the Senate and by a large margin in the House. Wardner says he didn’t know the amendment had been put in the budget bill and thinks other senators didn’t, either. Wardner says he and House Minority Leader Chet Pollert will meet with Auditor Josh Gallion next week to discuss the issue and how it will affect the agency. Leaders can recall the Legislature if they haven’t used all their allotted days.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voters in the capital have agreed to let the city take on as much as $1 billion more in debt to pay for renovations to roads and bridges, underground utilities and other infrastructure. Near the top of spending among issues approved Tuesday is a new municipal courthouse, estimated to cost about $130 million. Voters also approved reserving $50 million for affordable housing as Columbus prepares for a regional plan to address what experts say is a 54,000-unit shortage. The Columbus Dispatch reports this is the largest bond package approved since 2008, when voters passed a $1.7 billion debt plan, mostly to pay for water and sewer projects. The projects won’t raise taxes, but the city could raise property taxes if it can’t repay the debt.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former U.S. soldier from the state who was pardoned this week for his 2009 conviction for killing an Iraqi prisoner says he initially didn’t answer the White House’s phone call to tell him of the pardon. Former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna says he was on the phone with his father, retired FBI agent Scott Behenna, when the call came about 2:30 p.m. Monday as he was driving. He didn’t recognize the number and thought it might be a telemarketer, so he let it go to voicemail. After checking his messages, he returned the call and was told President Donald Trump was granting him a pardon and would call him back. When Behenna’s phone rang again, it was Trump’s office putting the president on the line so he could tell Behenna personally. He was convicted in 2009 of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone in the 2008 killing of Ali Mansur Mohamed, an unarmed Iraqi prisoner.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A bill to allow dentists in the state to administer vaccines to patients has been signed into law. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Oregon is the first state in the country to allow dentists to administer any vaccine available at a primary care doctor’s office. Most people may not get their measles, polio and tetanus shots from the dentist, but Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry Dean Phillip Marucha says they might want vaccines relevant to oral health such as HPV. He says a large percentage of new oral cancer diagnoses are linked to HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that can also cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Marucha said this law allows a dentist to educate patients about the value of the HPV vaccine and then administer it onsite.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The State Board of Education is giving its support to proposals by Gov. Tom Wolf to require students start schooling by age 6 and continue until they’re at least 18. The board voted unanimously Wednesday for the Democratic governor’s proposals that he unveiled in February. The Republican-controlled Legislature still must approve the proposals for them to take effect. The Wolf administration says lowering the mandatory start age from 8 to 6 would affect about 3,300 children. Officials say only one other state allows parents to keep children out of school until age 8, a policy Pennsylvania adopted in the late 19th century. Pennsylvania’s minimum age to drop out of school is currently 17. The administration says nearly 14,000 students drop out without graduating every year in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island has sued the state on behalf of nonfiction writers, saying a sales tax exemption for authors is unconstitutional because it only applies to works of fiction. The federal suit filed Tuesday argues that making a distinction between fiction and nonfiction violates the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A state law enacted in 2013 exempts from the sales tax “original and creative works” sold by writers, composers and artists residing in Rhode Island. The ACLU says the state’s taxation agency has concluded that nonfiction books are not “original and creative works.” A Department of Revenue spokesman said in a statement that the department had not received notice of the lawsuit and does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate has agreed to provide $120 million in tax breaks to the Carolina Panthers to move their practice fields and team headquarters out of North Carolina. The 27-15 vote Thursday came after contentious debate, with several senators questioning whether public money should be given to a billionaire NFL owner and saying the $3.8 billion proposed economic benefit of the new facility is wildly exaggerated. The bill, enthusiastically backed by Gov. Henry McMaster, would exempt the Panthers from paying state income taxes for players, coaches and other employees for 15 years as long as they use the money to build their new complex near Rock Hill. The team will continue to play games 15 miles north in Charlotte, North Carolina. McMaster is expected to quickly sign the bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The latest federal census of agriculture finds the number of farms in the state has dropped. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2017 census, South Dakota’s farmland was worked by fewer farming operations from 2012 to 2017. The census is conducted every five years. Statewide, more than 43 million acres were operated as farms. But there were 2,000 fewer farming operations in the state in 2017 than in 2012. The Aberdeen News reports the biggest drop came from farms operating between 10 and 1,000 acres. That number dropped by 1,850 over those five years. Nate Franzen, president of the Ag Banking Division at First Dakota National Bank based in Yankton, cites several reasons why farming operations are going out of business, including retirement, financial struggles and other business opportunities.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The National Civil Rights Museum is being honored by a federal agency that supports the nation’s museums. The Institute of Museum and Library Services said in a news release Tuesday that the Memphis-based museum is one of 10 recipients of National Medal for Museum and Library Service. Institute officials say the award honors museums and libraries that make exceptional contributions to their communities. Opened in 1991, the museum is built on the site of the former Lorraine Motel. Civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was fatally shot while standing on the hotel’s balcony April 4, 1968. The museum chronicles the history of the U.S. civil rights movement and holds discussions and events related to civil and human rights issues.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Electricity demand is expected to hit record levels this summer, and with a thin margin of reserve power, the operator of the state’s grid says it may have to ask businesses and consumers to conserve. Officials at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are not ruling out rolling blackouts, although they say other measures are more likely, including importing power from other grids. ERCOT predicted Wednesday that demand in the state will rise as high as 74,853 megawatts. That’s 1,300 megawatts higher than the record set last July 19. The grid operator predicts demand will grow at an above-normal rate of 2.5% to 3% every year through 2022. Demand is booming partly because of growing West Texas oil and gas operations and industrial development along the Gulf Coast.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A popular three-day music festival featuring the likes of rapper G-Eazy has been canceled after state officials refused to grant a liquor license. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the authorities cited past drug and alcohol-related violations in refusing to grant a permit for the Bonanza Campout, which was canceled Wednesday. The 4-year-old event had been scheduled for June 21-23 near Heber City, about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City. It would have presented 36 artists, including electronic-music producer DJ Snake and Australian pop-rock duo Empire of the Sun. Organizers said in a statement that all ticket and lodging purchases for the event will be refunded and that they plan to have the festival again in 2020.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Lawmakers are considering steps to make it easier for prison inmates to reduce the length of their sentences through good behavior or acts of heroism. The previous “good time” system was repealed in 2005 because it was thought to be too complex. Corrections Commissioner Mike Touchette says Vermont is one of a handful of states that lacks a good time program. Currently only prison work-camp inmates can earn shorter sentences. The Legislature is considering a number of proposals. One would allow inmates and offenders on furlough to earn a five-day sentence reduction for every month without a major discipline violation. Touchette says providing incentives for good behavior and rewarding that good behavior is “much more effective” than pure punishment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam has proclaimed May “Second Chance Month” in a bid to focus attention on criminal justice reform and inmate re-entry programs. Northam said in a statement Wednesday that redemption is a “fundamental American value” and that his administration is committed to making sure that former inmates have the support they need to succeed. The governor’s proclamation comes a few months after he asked Virginians for a second chance following a blackface scandal that almost forced him from office. Northam has since prioritized efforts to address long-standing racial inequities, particularly those related to the criminal justice system. The Democratic governor was recently able to overcome strong opposition from key GOP lawmakers and eliminate the suspension of driver’s licenses for motorists with unpaid court fines and costs.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A state official says wolves should be removed from the federal endangered species list in the entirety of the state. Washington Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind in April wrote a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in support of the proposal to delist wolves in the Lower 48 states. Susewind calls the proposal “appropriate and timely” as wolves are recovering. Wolves in the eastern third of Washington are already delisted. The Center for Biological Diversity criticized the letter, saying the idea of stripping federal protections from wolves is “appalling.” The environmental group contends 72% of Washington residents want federal protection. The federal government has already delisted wolves in the eastern third of Washington and Oregon, as well as in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClay: A new rail trail is set to be built in the state. Gov. Jim Justice announced Wednesday that the state has signed a letter of intent to purchase land for the project. The trail will use 72 miles of existing rail lines in Clay and Kanawha counties, along the Elk River and Buffalo Creek. Justice says the tracks will be converted into trails for walking, hiking, biking or other recreational purposes. He says the project could become the second-longest rail trail east of the Mississippi. Justice says the he hopes portions of the trail will be up and running by summer 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWest Allis:A plate of eggs stole the attention of social media this week when the president’s favorite TV show, “Fox and Friends,” broadcast from a local diner. Johnny V’s says the plate of a whopping 10 sunny side up eggs that appeared in front of a man deriding politicians’ plans for “free this, free that” was actually part of its King of Johnny V’s breakfast special, which also includes eight huge pancakes, a pound of hash browns, three pieces of bacon, three pieces of sausage, a piece of ham and Texas toast. If a single person can finish it in an hour, they get the meal and a T-shirt free. They also get their picture posted on a wall. The staff was hoping the King challenge would get a shout-out from the Fox TV host, but time apparently didn’t allow for it.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: National forest managers in the western part of the state expect to see large numbers of mushroom hunters in the weeks ahead. Forests that have recently burned are prime places to look for tasty morel mushrooms. A large area of Bridger-Teton National Forest that burned in 2018 could be prime hunting grounds. Morels also like wet weather, and the region has received plenty of rain and snow this spring. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports forest officials have implemented a $300 fee for morel hunters who sell their finds. They will only allow commercial morel hunting in the northern part of the Roosevelt Fire burn area. Recreational morel hunters can hunt anywhere in the forest for free but may not collect more than 3 gallons of morels.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers.

A public viewing begins at 1 p.m. This memorial work of black steel spires in a “V” shape with an outline of Parks’ face was created by Montgomery artist Ian Mangum. “The museum hopes that this piece will help elevate Mangum’s work and provide visitors a new way to interact with history and Rosa Parks’ legacy,” said Madeline Burkhardt, the museum’s adult education coordinator and curator. It’s identical to a piece Mangum made a year ago for Maxwell Air Force Base, where he works as an assistant logistic superintendent. The Maxwell one was designed, built and installed in under three months. It’s across from the building Parks worked at on the base, next to the elementary and middle school. Col. Eries Mentzer, commander of the 42nd Air Base Wing, had the idea to create it.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Rep. Christopher Kurka, a conservative freshman state legislator, said he plans to run for governor, joining a field that includes Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy. Kurka, a Wasilla Republican, announced his plans in a video on social media in which he levied criticisms at Dunleavy. “The dirty little secret of Juneau and Washington, D.C. is that while most conservative officials talk tough about Republican ideals, very few have the intestinal fortitude, moral compass or even the intent to take the principled stand necessary to accomplish any real change,” he said. A message seeking comment about the Republican challenger was sent to Dunleavy’s campaign. Bill Walker, an independent and former governor; former state Rep. Les Gara, a Democrat; and Libertarian William “Billy” Toien are among those who also have said they plan to run. Voters last year approved a new elections process that would end party primaries and institute ranked choice voting in general elections. The top four vote-getters in the primary would advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Former President Donald Trump has endorsed two Arizona legislative candidates who gained national notoriety for promoting the state Senate’s review of the 2020 election. Trump issued statements Monday endorsing Sen. Wendy Rogers and former Rep. Anthony Kern. Rogers has grown to prominence in pro-Trump circles for claiming Arizona’s election was marred by fraud and demanding the results be decertified. Rogers so far faces no Republican opposition. One Democrat has notified the secretary of state he intends to challenge her, though it’s unknown how competitive her district will be once final boundaries are adopted. Kern was the only Republican lawmaker to lose his reelection bid in 2020. He was spotted counting ballots for several days at the Senate’s election review despite the leaders’ promises that they would screen counters for political biases. Kern also was a plaintiff on a federal lawsuit challenging Arizona’s 2020 election results, which was rejected by a judge. Kern is running for the state Senate seat held by Republican Paul Boyer, who has infuriated Trump and his allies with his criticism of the Senate’s ballot review. Boyer is not seeking reelection.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A Republican panel approved new boundaries for state House and Senate seats that create a new majority-Hispanic district but still drew complaints that it diluted minority voters’ representation in the Legislature. The Board of Apportionment unanimously approved the new district lines for the state’s 100 House and 35 Senate seats. The board is composed of Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and Secretary of State John Thurston, who are all Republicans. Republicans hold a majority in both chambers of the Legislature. The redistricting maps were approved after the panel tweaked parts of the map that were released to the public a month ago. The new boundaries keep the number of majority-Black Senate districts the same at four. In the House, the number of majority-Black districts decreased by one to 11, and a new majority-Hispanic district was created in northwest Arkansas. That district, however, doesn’t include Democratic Rep. Megan Godfrey, who represents the area and has been an advocate for the Hispanic community in the Legislature. Minutes after the map was approved, Godfrey tweeted that she would not seek reelection. Democrats also said the map dilutes the representation of racial minorities altogether, saying the number of House districts where racial minorities make up a majority of the voting age population decreased from 17 to 14.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Beach: California reopened fishing along a stretch of southern coastline after barring the activity for weeks following an offshore oil spill. The state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife said a ban on the taking of fish and shellfish would be lifted at 11:59 a.m. Tuesday and fishing can resume at midday. The closure in early October covered 650 square miles of coastal waters and approximately 45 miles of shoreline, mainly in Orange County. The decision came after testing to ensure the fish along the coast were safe for human consumption after pipeline owned by Houston-based Amplify Energy leaked about 25,000 gallons (94,635 liters) of crude oil in early October. The weekslong closure dealt a blow to fishermen who said customers didn’t want to buy their catch, fearing it was contaminated and walloped charter operators who run fishing trips off the Southern California coast. Some have joined lawsuits against Amplify and said their biggest fear is that the spill’s stigma will drive away tourists even after the oily tar that washed up on the beaches is long gone.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Four popular Northern Colorado state wildlife areas no longer require a special pass to access after the Parks and Wildlife Commission created an exemption for the areas at its November meeting. Bellaire Lake, Dowdy Lake, West Lake and Poudre River state wildlife areas were among 24 areas that received an exemption to the Colorado State Wildlife Area Pass, which went on sale May 1. The exempt areas were determined by site-specific factors such as enforcement and public accessibility, according to the commission. The three small lakes in the Red Feather Lakes area northwest of Fort Collins include Roosevelt National Forest campgrounds and are popular with kayakers and canoeists in addition to fishing. The Poudre River site contains land along the river in the lower Poudre Canyon and includes Picnic Rock, which is a popular swimming and whitewater area of the river. Larimer County is home to 19 state wildlife area properties totaling 30,939 acres of land and water. The annual pass fee is $46.48 (including a required $10.40 Colorado Wildlife Habitat Stamp, which also is required when purchasing a hunting or fishing license). Annual passes for youths (16-17 years of age), seniors (65 and older) and low-income residents are $10.07 with no requirement to purchase a habitat stamp. A one-day pass is $9, with no habitat stamp purchase required.\n\nConnecticut\n\nUncasville: Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment, the corporation that owns the Mohegan Tribe’s various gambling enterprises, said it has completed the $1.5 billion in financing needed to develop the first stage of a casino and entertainment resort in South Korea. The initial phase of the Inspire Entertainment Resort, to be built on Yeongjong Island in Incheon, about 25 miles from Seoul, is targeted to open in 2023. It is expected to include more than 1,200 guest rooms in three hotel towers, a 15,000-seat arena, a foreigners-only casino, an indoor water park, convention facilities and other amenities. Bobby Soper, international president for MGE, said the corporation is anticipating a “significant rebound in the tourism and leisure industry following the pandemic.” The Mohegan Tribe owns and operates Connecticut’s Mohegan Sun, one of the largest casinos in North America. The Mohegans were awarded a license by the South Korean government in 2016 to develop a $5 billion resort at Incheon International Airport. It will be the tribal corporation’s first international project.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Two Native American tribes in Delaware are buying back land that had been part of their ancestral homelands. The Washington Post reported the Nanticoke Indian tribe acquired 30 acres in Millsboro this fall. The Lenape Indian tribe is expected to close a deal in early 2022 for 11 acres near Fork Branch Nature Preserve in Dover. Behind the land deals are partnerships between the individual tribes and several other entities. They include the environmental nonprofit Conservation Fund, the state of Delaware and a private conservation group located near Wilmington that is called Mt. Cuba Center. Blaine Phillips, a senior vice president for the Conservation Fund, said the land deals are “about restoring culture. It’s about honoring their ancestral rights.” Leaders of both tribes said they tried for years to buy the parcels of the land. But they said that they either couldn’t make the deal come together or lacked the money. “We, the Indians, had free run of the state of Delaware before contact with Europeans,” said Dennis “White Otter” Coker, the principal chief of the Lenape Indian tribe of Delaware. “All of this land was ours.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:About 100 firefighters fought a large blaze in an apparently vacant home in northwest D.C. on Tuesday morning. WUSA-TV reported. Crews responded to a fire in the 5400 block of Colorado Avenue Northwest to find flames shooting from the windows of the home just before 8 a.m. Firefighters upgraded the response to a second-alarm because of heavy fire conditions. The flames forced firefighters from the home and attack the blaze from the outside, using ladders and hoses. No one was inside the home at the time the fire broke out and D.C. fire and EMS said in a tweet that the home appeared to be vacant. All firefighters have been accounted for, and no injuries were reported. Investigators from the Washington bureau of the ATF were on scene to assist firefighters. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he will include raises and bonuses for law enforcement when he announces his overall state budget proposal next week. DeSantis is proposing repeating the $1,000 bonuses law enforcement, firefighters and emergency medical technicians received this year. He also wants $73 million to raise the minimum salary for entry-level state law enforcement officers by 20% and give existing state law enforcement officers a 25% raise. “Increasing salaries for state law enforcement by 20 and 25% respectively is going to make a real difference for those officers, it will make a real difference for the families, it will help retain a lot of the talented people we have as well as recruit new people,” DeSantis said. The Legislature is still weeks away from releasing its budget proposals, and lawmakers do not have to follow the governor’s recommendations. But the House and Senate are dominated by Republicans and the chambers’ leaders have helped DeSantis pass previous budget priorities. And this is DeSantis’ final budget before the November election, which gives Republicans more incentive to let him tout legislative victories.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: At least seven colleges in Georgia and one in Louisiana are now offering classes about late civil rights leader the Rev. C.T. Vivian, and those involved in creating the curriculum hope to expand that number to at least 50 schools by next year, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Vivian, an early and key adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. who organized pivotal campaigns for equality, died last year at the age of 95. The effort to teach college students about him is being led by longtime friends and educators, according to the newspaper. “The life and work of C.T. Vivian provides a useful case study and a template for action that will both educate and inspire the next generation of servant leaders,” said Beverly Tatum, a former Spelman College president. The lessons use Vivian’s books and videos as a foundation, but professors can create their own syllabuses. In Georgia, Emory University and Kennesaw State University are among the schools offering courses based on Vivian’s teachings. Louisiana State University at Shreveport is also part of the effort. Vivian began staging sit-ins against segregation in Peoria, Illinois, in the 1940s. He met King soon after the budding civil rights leader’s leadership of the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and helped organize the Freedom Rides that forced federal intervention across the South.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A $377 million rental car center with room for 4,500 vehicles is scheduled to open at Honolulu’s airport this week. Gov. David Ige and other state officials were scheduled to dedicate the center at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport on Tuesday. It will open for business on Wednesday. The five-story facility will allow rental car companies to house their operations in the same centrally located, covered airport structure directly across from airline terminals, said Ross Higashi, the deputy director of the state Department of Transportation’s airports division. Higashi told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser the project will make it easier for car rental companies to control and maintain their inventory. Companies will have room to store, rent, fuel, wash and repair cars. Many customers will be able to walk to the center from the terminals, eliminating the need for rental car companies to run pickup shuttles on a constant loop. A consolidated busing system will transport remaining customers. Higashi said the project was built with revenue from a $4.50 daily fee applied to car rentals. Planning for the facility began in 2012 and construction started in 2016.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An Idaho law banning nearly all abortions would take effect if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that declared a nationwide right to abortion. The court with a 6-3 conservative majority on Wednesday will hear arguments over a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks. That law is on hold following a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling. The Mississippi law is also at odds with a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that states can’t prevent women from terminating pregnancies before viability, around 24 weeks. If those rulings are overturned, as Mississippi officials argued they should be, states would decide whether to regulate abortion before a baby can survive outside the womb. That would trigger an Idaho law, passed in 2020, banning all abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. That law would take effect in Idaho 30 days after the Supreme Court decision. That law passed the Republican-dominated Idaho House and Senate with no Democratic support, and was signed into law by Republican Gov. Brad Little. Under the law, criminal punishment would be a felony and apply to the person performing the abortion, not the woman. Little in July signed onto an amicus brief with Republican governors from 11 other states supporting the Mississippi law now before the Supreme Court.\n\nIllinois\n\nEvanston: A sandhill crane that couldn’t eat because a piece of plastic was wedged on its beak is on the mend after getting a helping hand from a group of suburban Chicago volunteers. Shana Conner, a volunteer with the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, helped rescue the crane Friday after getting a call on Thanksgiving that the troubled bird had been seen in Rogers Park. “I was worried about this bird all night because I was like ‘it’s going to starve to death, and I couldn’t find it,’ ” Conner told the Chicago Sun-Times. After the crane was spotted Friday by alert neighbors in nearby Evanston, Conner rushed to the scene while two other volunteers tried to capture the bird. Scott Judd, one of those volunteers, said the crane didn’t give up without a struggle. But they finally netted it and Conner pulled the plastic piece from its beak. The bird was then placed in a cage and soon laid down.“It was exhausted; it probably hadn’t eaten in days,” Judd said. The bird was taken to the Willowbrook Wildlife Hospital for treatment and was being treated Sunday for emaciation and beak wounds. Judd said he suspects the crane was among some 20,000 sandhill cranes he witnessed flying over Chicago on Nov. 22 on their way to warmer climates.\n\nIndiana\n\nMichigan City: A towering sand dune at the Indiana Dunes National Park has kept up its inland creep, covering up an access road and threatening to bury a parking lot in the coming years. The park’s landmark Mount Baldy has largely been closed to public climbing since a 6-year-old boy was rescued in 2013 after being buried in a cavity in the dune that researchers blamed on decaying sand-covered trees. The dune lacks much stabilizing grasses, so winds off Lake Michigan have taken as much as 30 feet off its previous 125-foot peak, National Park Service Ranger Rafi Wilkinson told The (Northwest Indiana) Times. Sand from the dune moved about 10 feet this past year, covering part of a road leading from the parking lot for those visiting Mount Baldy and its nearby beach on the park’s eastern edge. The shifting sands could consume the entire parking lot and a restroom building at the site. “It’s an extremely popular place to park, but the lake always wins,” Wilkinson said. “Mother Nature always wins at this level. It would be impractical to remove that much sand. Indiana Dunes National Park drew nearly 2.3 million visitors during 2020, its second year with national park status.\n\nIowa\n\nNorth Liberty: A nonprofit is working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop a plan to save a suburban Iowa City lake from rapid sedimentation that threatens to render it unusable in as few as 20 years. Jon Kounkel is president of the group, Friends of Coralville Lake, The Gazette reported. He bought a house in nearby North Liberty during the winter nearly two decades ago. But when the ice melted, he discovered the lake’s dirty brown water. “The lake was beautiful when it was frozen over and covered in snow,” Kounkel said. When he and his family went out onto the lake for the first time, his daughter pointed out the “chocolate bubbles” in the water. Kounkel said he has watched the lake declined as 1,300 acre-feet of additional sediment per year drops into the lake. That’s the equivalent of two Empire State Buildings a year. The Army Corps estimated it will be 20 to 30 years before the lake becomes unusable for boating and other recreation because of the silt. The group will look at several possible solutions, including setting up a watershed management authority that would work to reduce sedimentation flow into the lake. Other possibilities include buffer strips and silt traps to slow or catch the silt. One action not being considered is dredging the lake, which is costly and dangerous for the environment, according to Jonathan Wuebker, assistant operations manager for the Corps.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly appointed Janet Stanek, a former Topeka hospital executive, as the new secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Stanek most recently was director of the state employee health benefits program. She replaces Dr. Lee Norman, who announced his resignation Nov. 19. He had been the health department’s top administrator since Kelly took office in January 2019. “With Janet’s decades of experience as well as the relationships she has built across the medical community in Kansas, I have no doubt that she will be able to step into this role immediately and continue the agency’s critical work,” Kelly said in a news release. Kelly’s office said Stanek has held health care leadership positions in Pennsylvania, New York and Kansas, including 21 years at Stormont Vail Health Topeka, where she last was chief operating officer and senior vice president. Stanek also is board chair of the Kansas Health Institute, a nonpartisan health policy organization. Stanek will serve as acting secretary until the Senate confirms her appointment.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The Kentucky National Guard said about 150 soldiers are deploying to eastern Africa. A ceremony Saturday at the Lexington airport honored members of the Somerset-based 149th Infantry Regiment as they entered federal active duty, the National Guard said in a news release. The unit will deploy under the command of a task force from the Virginia Army National Guard and provide security around the Horn of Africa, the statement said. About 200 other Kentucky National Guard members are preparing for a separate mobilization to southeast Europe in early 2022. They will work with the Virginia National Guard in a NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, the statement said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Tulane University, a private institution in New Orleans, will be the lead tenant of a former public hospital building that has been closed since Hurricane Katrina flooded it in 2005. The school will occupy more than one-third of the Charity Hospital building. “The plan at this point is that it will be the new home for the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine – as well as laboratories, academic, and instructional space for the Tulane School of Medicine and Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine,” Patrick Norton, Tulane’s senior vice president and chief operating officer, said in a statement emailed by a school spokesman. The 20-story art deco building, which was completed in 1938 and covers a city block, was a hospital for nearly 70 years. Tulane will occupy a 12-story wing, university spokesman Mike Strecker said. The wing is expected to open in 2025.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A ski mountain is set to remove a derogatory term for Native American women from its name – two decades after state law eliminated the slur from names of communities and public landmarks. The leader of a group of investors that’s buying Big Squaw Mountain Resort in Greenville vowed to retire the name upon completion of the purchase, the Portland Press Herald reported. “It’s going to change. There is no doubt about that,” said Perry Williams, managing partner at Big Lake Development Co. “It’s about time,” Penobscot National Tribe Ambassador Maulian Dana said of the prospective owners’ plans. The mountain’s name was changed from Big Squaw Mountain to Big Moose Mountain after the state banned the word from public place names such as towns, mountains and lakes in 2000. But the offensive word had carried on at the ski resort because it’s a privately owned business. The word “squaw,” derived from the Algonquin language, might have once meant “woman,” but over generations, the word morphed into a misogynist and racist term to disparage Indigenous women, according to experts.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A panel of state lawmakers voted Monday to recommend Del. Dereck Davis to become the state’s next treasurer. The Special Joint Legislative Committee to Select the State Treasurer voted 10-0 for Davis, a Prince George’s County Democrat who has been the House Economic Matters chairman. The panel heard from four candidates who are seeking the position before voting on the recommendation. The other three candidates were Jorge Cortes, Joseph Zimmerman and John Douglass. All four names will be submitted to the Maryland General Assembly, which is scheduled to vote on selecting a new treasurer during a special session of the legislature, which is convening next week for a special session on redistricting to create a new congressional map. The treasurer’s office is becoming vacant with the retirement of Nancy Kopp.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: Sea turtle strandings on Cape Cod are picking up after a slow start to the season, experts at the New England Aquarium said. The aquarium has so far cared for almost 120 of the animals at its Quincy turtle hospital, the vast majority of which have been endangered Kemp’s ridley turtles. But scientists have also treated eight green turtles and two loggerheads. The turtles are treated for life-threatening conditions, including pneumonia and dehydration, a result of days or weeks of hypothermia and the inability to feed. “Early in the season, we typically see the smaller Kemp’s ridley and green turtles. The larger loggerhead turtles will start to wash ashore in December, though we saw our first loggerhead of the season on Thanksgiving Day,” said Charles Innis, the aquarium’s director of animal health. The turtles get trapped in Cape Cod Bay as temperatures drop and wind patterns change, and they quickly become hypothermic. The stranding season started late this year because of temperature fluctuations that kept water in the bay warm. The turtles are assessed and treated in Massachusetts, a process that can take weeks or even months, before being flown to Southern states for continued rehabilitation and eventual release back into the ocean.\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: City leaders said they are accepting bids from contractors for an ambitious project to replace all lead water pipes no later than 2023 because of elevated levels of the toxic metal in the municipal supply. Because the “action level” for lead has been exceeded, for three years, the estimated 2,800 service lines generally must be removed over 14 to 15 years under federal and state regulations. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer promised last month to spend millions of dollars to replace them in 18 months. Benton Harbor formally invited bids last week and released details about the plan Monday. “We’re very excited here in the city to make that announcement. I know that it will be received gladly,” Mayor Marcus Muhammad said. Residents in the impoverished, predominantly Black community have been encouraged to use bottled water for cooking, drinking, brushing teeth, rinsing foods and mixing powdered infant formula. Companies will be required to use trenchless technology to minimize the disruption to properties. They will have to restore the condition of driveways, sidewalks and landscaping. And there will be incentives and penalties to ensure the work is done well and on time.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Police are investigating a fight that erupted in a terminal at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport shortly after a plane had landed from Orlando, Florida. About a dozen male and female passengers were involved in the scrape after two large groups of travelers deplaned from a Frontier Airlines flight just before midnight Friday, said Patrick Hogan, spokesman for the Metropolitan Airports Commission. “I don’t have the motivation for the fight yet,” Hogan said Monday. “That’s part of the investigation that’s going on.” A video of the incident, which lasted just over a minute, was posted on social media and shared by more than 7,000 people by midday Monday, the Star Tribune reported. Punches were exchanged among several people and some of them threw stanchions and broke chairs, Hogan said. Airport police responded to the scene in less than two minutes and Bloomington police were on hand at the baggage claim area to help “keep the peace,” he said. Injuries appeared to be minor and all of the people involved in the incident declined to be transported to a hospital for treatment, Hogan said. No arrests have been made. Hogan said police will assess charges after reviewing video and other evidence.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: A green sea turtle named Banner has inspired a children’s musical, “Banner: A Sea Turtle Saga,” put on by theater students from Mississippi State University. It debuted at Mississippi State in early November and was performed on Monday at the Mississippi Aquarium in Gulfport. The show, written by Mississippi State Associate Professor of Communications Tonya Hays and marine scientist and Northern Gulf Institute Education and Outreach Director Jonathan Harris, tells the story of Banner and his sea-creature friends who go on an underwater adventure. The story teaches about the dangers marine animals face, from plastic pollution and oil spills. Banner was rescued in Florida after being severely injured by a boat propeller. The green sea turtle is the world’s largest species of hard-shelled turtle. It is a threatened species in U.S. Atlantic waters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The show featured student performers wearing puppets of various marine life designed by Mississippi coast theater veteran Tim Baker, of Gulfport. Baker, a professional sculptor, propmaker and special effects artist, has worked with Marvel Studios and Universal Orlando on multiple film projects.\n\nMissouri\n\nMarble Hill: University of Minnesota paleontologist Peter Makovicky, who helped lead a dig in Bollinger County that uncovered fossils of a large duck-billed dinosaur, said he believes the remains of many other dinosaurs will be found at the site. The latest fossils are a specimen of Parrosaurus missouriensis, first discovered at the same site nearly 80 years ago but not confirmed as a new species until the latest dig. Experts believe the plant-eating dinosaurs grew to about 35 feet in length. Remains of four of the species have been found in the same area about 110 miles south of St. Louis. Last month, a crane hoisted a 2,500-pound chunk of remains from the latest find from the glen of a wooded area. The fossils will go to Chicago’s Field Museum for further research. “We actually have something that’s probably a mass death locality, where we have a herd of dinosaurs dying and being sort of buried together, and individuals of different ages,” Makovicky said. The first dinosaur fossils at the site were found in the early 1940s, uncovered by a family digging a well. Experts weren’t sure what sort of dinosaur it was and the bones were shelved for a long time. A Missouri paleontologist purchased the property in the 1980s. A second set of dinosaur bones were found then. Beyond dinosaur bones, the teams have found remains of massive turtles, prehistoric fish, even crocodiles that might have been to up 50 feet long.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:A Great Falls man was sentenced Monday to 65 years in prison for killing another man with a hatchet during a March 2018 street fight. A Cascade County jury in September convicted James Michael Parker, 35, of deliberate homicide, assault with a weapon and witness tampering in the death of Lloyd Geadry, 45. Geaudry died of a sharp force injury to his neck that fractured his spine and severed an artery, court records said. “A total of 11 people were involved in the street fight in Great Falls, prosecutors said. District Court Judge Elizabeth Best sentenced Parker to 55 years for the homicide and another 10 years for assaulting another person during the fight, the Great Falls Tribune reported. She also sentenced him to a concurrent 10 years for witness tampering. Best also ordered Parker to pay $14,000 in restitution. Parker has been in custody since November 2018, according to county jail records.\n\nNebraska\n\nDenton: A garage fire near Denton has caused more than $1 million in damage to several classic cars and motorcycles. The Lincoln Journal Star reported the fire broke out Saturday in a detached garage. Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner said the 50-by-100-foot garage was fully engulfed in flames by the time deputies arrived. Corvettes from 1956, 1958, 1962 and 1969 were destroyed, along with other vintage cars and four Harley Davidson motorcycles. The building was a total loss. Authorities said the fires cause was accidental.\n\nNevada\n\nHenderson: Democratic Mayor Debra March said she plans to run for lieutenant governor in 2022. March has served on Henderson’s city council since 2009 and as mayor since 2017. She said in a press release last week that her platform would focus on economic development and diversification and draw from her experience attracting jobs to Henderson, which is Nevada’s second-largest incorporated city. There is no office-holder serving as lieutenant governor in Nevada. Former Lt. Gov. Kate Marshall resigned in August to accept a position as an advisor in the White House’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Although it wouldn’t be months until she entered the race, the Nevada Democratic Party endorsed March in the following days. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak has not appointed a replacement for Marshall. Beyond March, Carson City Democrat Kimi Cole and Republicans Dan Schwartz, Stavros Anthony and Mack Miller have also announced plans to run for the seat. The lieutenant governor in Nevada is a part-time position, presides over the state Senate and chairs the state commission on tourism.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: Researchers at the University of New Hampshire are getting nearly $3 million to study how teens and young adults are affected when their peers harm themselves. The grant from the National Institutes of Health will help researchers explore how bystanders handle incidents involving self-directed violence, how often such incidents happen and the results when bystanders intercede. Kimberly Mitchell, at the university’s Crimes Against Children Research Center, said self-directed violence including suicide is a significant public health issue, but there is very limited information about how bystanders to such violence are impacted by the help they might provide. Researchers hope their work will lead to successful suicide prevention programs that also could help the bystanders themselves.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson:City education officials paid their custodial services vendor $6.34 million during a recent 16-month period while Paterson’s schools were closed to students because of COVID-19, according to public records. The Paterson Board of Education has asked the district’s attorneys to investigate the payments, which were made to Pritchard Industries of Florham Park, officials said. From April 2020 through July 2021, the district paid Pritchard $6.34 million, records showed. The monthly payments varied greatly, ranging from $60,800 to $620,250. In eight of those months, the payments exceeded $500,000. By comparison, before the COVID-19 school closure, the district had been paying Pritchard $681,050 a month, according to public records. During the remote learning period, Paterson schools were open on a limited basis, mainly for such activities as the distribution of meals and Chromebooks. A few employees reported for work at city schools during that time – including principals and their assistants – but almost all other educators and students stayed home. Paterson Board of Education members said a portion of the money paid to Pritchard during the coronavirus shutdown stemmed from a state law adopted at the outset of the pandemic that required school districts to continue paying “contracted service providers” during a public health emergency.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico oil and gas regulators are watching closely as increased seismic activity is being reported in the Permian Basin along the Texas state line. Under a plan recently rolled out by the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, pending permits for wastewater injection in certain areas will require extra review. More reporting and monitoring also could be required and if things worsen, the state could limit how much wastewater is injected in disposal wells. State officials said the protocols were developed in partnership with New Mexico Tech and after getting feedback from the oil and gas industry. Division Director Adrienne Sandoval said New Mexico is trying to be proactive with what she described as a pragmatic approach. The protocols call for reporting and monitoring when two magnitude 2.5 events occur within 30 days and within a 10-mile radius. Within that area, operators will be required to provide weekly reports on daily injection volumes and average daily surface pressure and share that with the state when requested. If one magnitude 3.0 occurs, operators will have to reduce their injection rates – with higher reductions required closer to the epicenter. Between March and September, the Oil Conservation Division received reports of seven earthquakes with magnitudes from 2.5 to 4.0 in an area about 35 miles east southeast of Malaga in southeastern New Mexico. Of these earthquakes, four were magnitude 3.0 or greater.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi said he is running for governor in next year's election, joining a competitive primary race that became wide open when former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned. Suozzi told reporters on a virtual news conference that he's jumping into the 2022 race. “I’m a common sense Democrat,\" Suozzi said. “I don’t believe it’s about going to the far left or to the far right; it’s about trying to find the answers to the problems that we face.” Suozzi represents Long Island, including its wealthy north shore, and parts of Queens in New York's 3rd Congressional District. He survived a tough reelection in 2020, gaining a narrow victory in the swing district that tilts toward Democrats. The open race to replace him will likely be highly contested by both parties. The Democratic primary race includes Gov. Kathy Hochul, who took office after Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations; Attorney General Letitia James, whose investigation of the allegations prompted Cuomo’s resignation; and Jumaane Williams, New York City’s elected public advocate. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose term ends this year, has also been hinting that he might enter the race. De Blasio filed paperwork to create a fundraising committee last month.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPilot Mountain: Fire crews are working to control a fire in Pilot Mountain State Park that has burned hundreds of acres. Meanwhile the N.C. Forest Service said there is a ban on all open burning and has canceled all burning permits statewide until further notice. The fire that covered about 300 acres Monday grew by about 75 acres overnight, Forestry Service spokeswoman Christie Adams said. A team was expected to arrive Monday to take over management of the fire, Adams said. There were about 30 to 40 people involved in the fight Monday morning, she said. The fire was first reported Saturday night in the area of the Three Bear Gully Trail. The cause hasn’t been determined, Adams said. The State Parks and Recreation Department has said the park likely will be closed all week. The park northwest of Winston-Salem is known for its iconic knob that rises about 1,500 feet above the surrounding terrain.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: A former University of North Dakota student is accused of stealing more than $330,000 in federal coronavirus relief money, according to federal court documents. Enroy Duncan allegedly devised a scheme to defraud the government by filing a false application for Paycheck Protection Program funds. He is charged with wire fraud. Duncan falsely stated that his company, called “Homeinhome Senior Care,” had 17 employees and paid more than $1.6 million in wages, tips and compensation, court documents showed. The indictment said Duncan’s Grand Forks apartment was listed as the company’s address, but no records of the business could be found at the North Dakota Secretary of State’s office or Job Service. Duncan is living in Florida, where he made his first court appearance on Nov. 18, KVRR-TV reported. Court document do not list an attorney for Duncan.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Bernita Reese has been named the director of the city’s Department of Recreation and Parks, succeeding Paul Rakosky, who has been interim director since 2019. Reese was introduced Monday at the Beatty Community Center on the Near East Side by Mayor Andrew J. Ginther and Derrick Clay, president of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Commission. She is the first Black woman to be named the city's rec and parks director. Her annual salary will be $180,003. Reese said that first and foremost, parks and recreation centers are safe, and she will be working on ways to make them safer. She said she plans on meeting with Police Chief Elaine Bryant after she starts her job in January. People have been concerned about park safety since two homicides in city parks earlier this year. Reese most recently was director of parks and recreation for the city of Huntsville, Alabama. She had served for more than three years as assistant director for Columbus recreation and parks, then left for Huntsville in April. In Huntsville, Reese developed a playground replacement program and worked with community leaders to increase athletic tourism.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPerry: Authorities are investigating after a helicopter crashed in Oklahoma, killing one person and injuring another. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said the crash happened Sunday in Perry, about 60 miles north of Oklahoma City. The helicopter was privately owned and two people were on board at the time, Oklahoma City station KWTV reported. One person was pronounced dead at the scene and another was taken to a hospital, authorities said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating the crash.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland:The Oregon Health Authority is offering to pay pharmacies $35 for each dose of COVID-19 vaccine they administer, with the intention to boost vaccination rates. Based on the health authority’s database, 79% of people 18 years or older in Oregon have received at least their first vaccine dose. In addition, the Statesman Journal reported the program – which launched this month – directly addresses staffing shortages at pharmacies, where growing workloads have resulted in long lines across the state. In some cases, customers have reported having to wait two or three hours to pick up their prescriptions. The state is offering to pay temporary pharmacists in order to bolster workforces, said Rudy Owens, a public affairs specialist for the Oregon Health Authority. However, the temporary staffing program is only available to independent pharmacies. Corporate-owned pharmacies are not eligible, but they can still receive vaccine payments from the state. To qualify for the payments, pharmacies must meet certain standards for “vaccine equity,” including offering multilingual signs for COVID-19 vaccinations, “expanded vaccine-related counseling aimed at boosting vaccine confidence,” and “a plan for ongoing evaluation and continuous improvement to ensure equitable access,” according to a flyer from the health authority. Owens said the state doesn’t have data yet on how many pharmacies have applied for the supplemental payments.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said he is not considering additional containment measures as the omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads overseas, but continued to urge people to get vaccinated. Wolf said there is no cause for panic, noting that no cases of the omicron variant have been discovered in the United States. “In Pennsylvania and around the country, the vaccine is still our strategy, so get your shot,” Wolf said on a regularly scheduled appearance on KDKA-AM radio in Pittsburgh. “Get your vaccine. That’s our strategy and it seems to be working.” Infections, hospitalizations and intensive-care unit cases are rising in Pennsylvania and many other states. About 3,600 patients are hospitalized with COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, according to Department of Health figures. Wolf called that “very few” and said he doesn’t “see any need for Pennsylvania to do anything draconian at this point,” such as limiting elective surgeries to clear up hospital space.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The median price of a single-family home in Rhode Island has continued to rise as the number of sales has slowed, according to the Rhode Island Association of Realtors. The median price rose 12.7% in the past year, but the number of single-family home sales fell 22.3%, according to association data. Pending sales also decreased slightly. Agueda Del Borgo, the association’s president, said the housing market will likely show more tempered activity in 2022 but the association still expects sales to remain strong. There were similar trends in the condominium sector, but pending sales rose 10.8%. The association said that could indicate frustrated buyers in the single-family home market might be focusing on condominiums. Sales of multifamily homes, on the other hand, rose by 8.8% and the median price increased 15% annually.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOrangeburg: Duke Energy is giving a historically Black South Carolina university $150,000 in scholarships to help train and educate nuclear engineers. South Carolina State University said the money will provide about 15 scholarships over three years in its nuclear engineering program, which is the only undergraduate one of its kind in the state, interim university President Alexander Conyers said. The money from the Duke Energy Foundation is intended to strengthen the utility’s relationships with historically Black colleges and universities and bring more diverse talent into the company. “South Carolina State University has a significant reputation as a leader in building the high-quality workforce our state and nation need today and in years to come,” said Mike Callahan, president of Duke Energy's utility operations in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEllsworth Air Force Base: The primary adviser to the commander of the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base has been removed from his post for what officials described as inappropriate conduct. Chief Master Sgt. Just Deisch, the wing command chief, showed behavior that demonstrated a lack of respect, judgment and professionalism expected of a senior noncommissioned officer, base commander Col. Joseph Sheffield said. Base officials declined to release details. “All Airmen should be treated with dignity and respect, and senior leaders should set the example for subordinates by exercising sound judgement and decision-making both on and off duty,” Sheffield said in a statement. A phone number for Deisch could not be found. Base officials did not immediately respond to a message from the Associated Press. Base officials said the command chief is responsible for advising the commander on matters such as morale, welfare, warfighting effectiveness and professional development of the nearly 3,200 enlisted airmen at the base. Ellsworth Air Force Base is the largest B-1 bomber combat wing in the Air Force.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Gov. Bill Lee named Lisa Helton interim leader of the state Department of Correction after Commissioner Tony Parker said he would retire from his post. Helton will take over starting Wednesday and will fill the role until a permanent leader is picked. Helton is the assistant commissioner for the department’s community supervision division. Lee’s office said Helton has more than 25 years of experience in the criminal justice field. Parker is starting a job on Jan. 1 as president of a Knoxville-based criminal justice reform organization named 4th Purpose Foundation. Parker previously announced he would retire from the state this fall after almost four decades with the department.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A Houston man has been sentenced to more than nine years in prison after he was accused of using federal COVID-19 relief funding on a Lamborghini, a Rolex watch and trips to strip clubs, federal prosecutors said. Lee Price III, 30, was sentenced Monday to 110 months in prison. Price pleaded guilty in September to wire fraud and money laundering. “Mr. Price hopes that others will learn from his reckoning that there is no easy money,” Price’s attoney Tom Berg said in an email to news outlets. “He has the balance of the 110-month sentence to reflect, repent and rebuild his misspent life.” Prosecutors accused Price of fraudulently using more than $1.6 million in funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, which gave low-interest loans to small businesses struggling during the pandemic. According to prosecutors, Price also used the money to buy an $85,000 pickup truck and to pay off a loan on a residential property.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Zion National Park is halting its shuttle service for the winter season. Patrons can drive their vehicles up the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive starting Monday until Dec. 23, when the shuttle service will reopen for 10 days during the holiday season. As the number of annual visitors to Zion National Park recently reached a peak of nearly 4.52 million – a record for the park – officials are warning of packed parking lots and potential closures throughout the winter. During the 10-day shuttle run next month, private cars will not be allowed up the Scenic Drive, but will be allowed back on Jan. 2. Weekend shuttle service will resume in mid-February and daily shuttle service will resume in mid-March. Officials said to check on the park's website next year for more specific dates.\n\nVermont\n\nBarton: Gov. Phil Scott celebrated the beginning of the state’s unofficial Christmas tree season Monday by cutting trees for the Montpelier building where his office is located. The trees cut by Scott and Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts at the Maple Hill Farm in Barton will decorate the Pavilion Building. “This is a time of year to take note of the good and unite around the true meaning behind each of the seasons’ traditions: Togetherness, community and hope,” Scott said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said as of 2017, there were 3,650 acres of Christmas tree production in Vermont across 70 farms. The crop is worth more than $2.6 million. Jim Horst of the New Hampshire-Vermont Christmas Tree Association said many Vermonters bring to market Christmas trees, wreaths, garland and other decorative items. “Many trees are sold to the wholesale market for ultimate resale throughout the region,” Horst said. “Others, though, are sold directly to the consumer, who enjoy the process of actually visiting the farm and taking part in the ‘cut your own’ experience.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Enrollment at Virginia’s public schools has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to state data. Last year, 44,000 students left the state’s public schools, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Even after the state mandated reopening schools for five days a week, the number of students lagged by 46,000 students this year, compared to 2019. Henrico’s enrollment dropped below 50,000 students for the first time in more than a decade at 49,991 students. The district said it lost 1,400 students last year and saw a 118% increase in the number of students who left to attend private school. Much of the loss is in early grade levels. About 80,000 kindergartners enrolled last school year, nearly 12,000 fewer than the previous school year. This year, kindergarten enrollment grew to around 87,000, which is an increase, but not a return to pre-pandemic levels. The enrollment loss could affect how much the legislature is willing to offer in local budgets, unless it holds school districts harmless for enrollment loss like last year.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said repairs on the closed West Seattle Bridge are on schedule and the bridge should reopen for vehicular traffic sometime in mid-2022. Durkan said in a news conference that the city is on time and on budget, adding that the city knows the timeline still seems too slow for the communities being impacted, KOMO-TV reported. “We really are moving forward,” she said. The city closed the bridge abruptly in March 2020 after questions were raised about its structural integrity following the discovery of cracks. The bridge opened in 1984 and was projected to have a life of at least 40 years. The city opted to repair instead of replace the bridge to reopen it sooner for the thousands of motorists who use it daily. A West Seattle High-Rise Bridge Cost-Benefit Analysis report concluded the city could proceed with spending $47 million to repair the bridge. The bridge closure has caused ongoing traffic gridlock in the area. Durkan said the bridge is an economic driver in the city and state. Officials said the city secured $19 million in funding from the federal government to help pay for the needed repairs, along with $9 million from the Port of Seattle.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia Turnpike saw a big leap in traffic numbers during Thanksgiving week compared with the same week last year. Turnpike booths saw almost 733,000 vehicles pass through between Tuesday and Sunday, almost 30% more than the same period in 2020, the Department of Transportation said. Wednesday and Sunday were the busiest days on the Turnpike. Nearly 157,000 vehicles went through toll booths Wednesday and more than 165,000 on Sunday. The state Parkways Authority and the West Virginia Tourism Office came up with colorful wrappings for toll booths showing visitors what the state offers. There were strong sales during the week at Tamarack, Turnpike travel plazas and welcome centers, the Transportation Department said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hunters killed thousands fewer deer during Wisconsin’s nine-day gun season this year than in 2020, according to preliminary state Department of Natural Resources data. The DNR offers multiple deer hunting seasons each fall, but the nine-day season remains the pinnacle for hunters. It began at dawn on Nov. 20 and ran until nightfall Sunday. Hunters killed 175,667 deer, down 8% from the 190,646 killed during the 2020 nine-day stretch. The number of bucks killed was down 1.3% from last year. The antlerless take was down 13%. Hunters killed 9.3% more deer in the northern forest management zone this year than last, the only one of the state’s four management zones that saw an increase. The southern farmland zone, which includes most of the southern third of the state, saw a 17% drop in kills. The number of hunters who could have ventured into the woods remained virtually unchanged from 2020. The DNR reported it sold 564,440 hunting licenses that would allow someone to kill a deer using a gun during any of the state’s multiple gun seasons as of the Sunday close. That’s down about 0.8% from the 564,440 licenses sold at the same point last year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A Wyoming woman died Saturday when a car she was traveling in rolled along U.S. Highway 20-26 between Casper and Glenrock. The Wyoming Highway Patrol identified the victim as 32-year-old Lindsay Ritter, the Casper Star Tribune reported. The crash occurred about 7:45 p.m. Saturday as Ritter was traveling east in a Chevrolet Impala. The sedan drove off the road to the right, overcorrected to the left and then lost control, according to a highway patrol report. The report did not list any contributing factors to the crash.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/01"}]}

But for much longer, U.S. adults have increasingly made the conscious decision to leave or forgo organized religion, and the trend is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\nAbout 3 in 10 American adults now self-identify as religiously unaffiliated, a new study from the Pew Research Center found, reinforcing the notion that Americans are becoming more secular in the 21st century.\n\nThey are referred to as religious \"nones\" – people who self-describe as atheists, agnostics or \"nothing in particular\" when asked about their religious identity. And their numbers have been growing for some time: In 2007, only about 16% of Americans identified as religious nones, but that percentage has almost doubled since, according to the Pew study, which was released Tuesday.\n\nMore than a quarter of Americans said the coronavirus pandemic has made their personal faith grow stronger, according to another Pew Research Center study. But COVID-19 wasn't enough to reverse the trend of Americans leaving organized religion.\n\nThere's not a singular explanation for why Americans are becoming less religious. Some sociologists say it's more socially acceptable today to identify as religiously unaffiliated, while others believe the trend of delaying marriage and having children has decreased devotion to traditional religion.\n\n1 in 4 Americans identify as 'Nones':Why are millions leaving organized religion?\n\nChurch in a pub, politics at temple:Religious leaders are trying to win back the 'Nones'\n\nWhat is known is that the religious nones are largely a youth movement. A survey of a half-million Americans released in July found just over a third of adults under 30 were unaffiliated. In 1986, it was just 10%, according to the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute.\n\nChristianity still dominates U.S. religion in 2021, with 63% of adults identifying as such. But its historically iron grip on American society has slipped in the 21st century.\n\nChristians of all denominations, including Protestants, Catholics, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Orthodox Christians, outnumbered religious nones by almost 5-to-1 in 2007. Now, the ratio is closer to 2-to-1, the Pew study says.\n\nThe Christian decline is concentrated among Protestants, a broadly defined group including nondenominational Christians and people who describe themselves as “just Christian” as well as Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians and members of other denominations.\n\nForty percent of Americans are Protestants today, a drop from when more than half of the population identified as such in 2007.\n\nThe percentage of Catholics has held steady in recent years, notwithstanding a slow downward trickle since 2007. Twenty-one percent of Americans are Catholics in 2021, the same percentage as in 2014.\n\nOnly a quarter of Americans attend weekly religious services now, with Black evangelicals leading at 57%. Half of Protestants and about one-third of Catholics said they attend religious services at least monthly.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of Americans said they never attend religious services, and nearly a third seldom or never pray.

The study was released Tuesday.\n\nPreviously:One in four Americans identify as 'Nones.' Why are millions leaving organized religion?\n\nEach scenario begins with the nation’s religious makeup in 2020, as estimated by the Pew Research Center: 64% Christian, 30% unaffiliated and 6% members of all other religions.\n\nChristians make up less than 50% of the country by 2070 in three of the four scenarios.\n\nScenario No. 1: Christian population no longer majority, retains plurality\n\nIn this scenario, young Americans (ages 15 to 29) leave and join Christianity and other religions at similar rates observed in recent years. The share of Christians diminishes by a few percentage points every generation, according to Pew Research Center, eventually falling below 50% by 2060 and landing at 46% by 2070. Still, they represent the largest religious group in the country.\n\nMembers of other religions rise to 13% of the population by 2070, while 41% of the United States will have no religious affiliation in this scenario.\n\nScenario No. 2: Nearly half of US religiously unaffiliated by 2070\n\nYoung Americans progressively switch from Christianity with each generation before the rate begins to slow in this scenario.\n\nHere, Christians fall below 50% of the population by 2050 and to 39% by 2070. The percentage of Americans who have no religious affiliation rises to 48% by 2070, and the percentage of Americans who are members of non-Christian religions creeps up to 12%.\n\nScenario No. 3: US mostly secular by 2070\n\nBy 2070, 52% of Americans will not identify with any religion in this scenario, in which switching rises at a constant rate. The percentage of Americans who are Christians drops to 35%, and the percentage of Americans who belong to a non-Christian religion make up the remaining 12%.\n\nScenario No. 4: Christianity retains slim majority by 2070\n\nThis scenario appears unrealistic based on recent trends, as it assumes that Americans abruptly stop leaving religion after 2020.\n\nEven still, Christianity would see a 10% decline by 2070 as older American Christians die, according to Pew Research Center. The religiously unaffiliated would make up 34% of the country, and members of other religions would make up 12%.\n\nSCOTUS ruling:Supreme Court temporarily lets Jewish university refuse LGBTQ student group\n\nWhich scenario is the most likely?\n\nPew said scenario No. 2, which sees Christianity dip below 50% of the population by 2050 and to 39% by 2070, “best illustrates what would happen if recent generational trends in the U.S. continue, but only until they reach the boundary of what has been observed around the world, including in Western Europe.”\n\nData from dozens of countries around the world show that most people ages 30 to 49 who reported being raised Christian are still Christian, meaning that the Christian retention rate in those countries has not not fallen below 50%, according to Pew. Scenario No. 2 models for a Christian retention rate of 50% or above in the U.S.\n\nPew noted that every scenario assumed current demographic trends – migration, births and deaths – remain constant.\n\n'There's no perfect institution':'Honk for Jesus.

None more than this group", "text": "As a Nicaraguan-born girl growing up in Miami, Prisca Dorcas Mojica Rodríguez remembers going to church five times a week. Her father was a pastor, and their fundamentalist evangelical faith taught that a woman’s role was to serve her husband.\n\nAt the same time, Mojica Rodríguez saw how essential women were in keeping the pews filled and the church running. Ultimately, dismayed by the subservient role of women and the church's harsh restrictions on girls, she would leave her faith – and her husband – in her late 20s.\n\n\"Women are less inclined to be involved with churches that don’t want us speaking up, that don’t want us to be smart,\" said Mojica Rodríguez, who went on to earn a master’s degree in divinity. \"We’re like the mules of the church – that’s what it feels like.\"\n\nThough the Nashville-based author and activist is now 39, her experience reflects a growing and, for churches, a potentially worrisome trend of young women eschewing religion. Their pace of departure has overtaken men, recent studies show, reversing patterns of previous generations.\n\nAmericans have been disaffiliating from organized religion over the past few decades. About 63% of Americans are Christian, according to the Pew Research Center, down from 90% in the early 1990s.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of those who describe themselves as agnostic, atheist, or “nothing in particular” has risen to 28%. But it had been males, especially young men, leading these shifts – until now.\n\n\"For as long as we’ve been conducting surveys on religion, men have exhibited consistently lower levels of religious commitment than women – across cultures, class divisions, any way you cut it,\" said Daniel A. Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life, whose data helped spotlight the trend. \"That’s what made this so notable.\"\n\nA forthcoming study from Barna Group and Impact 360 Institute reaffirms the pattern, Barna CEO David Kinnaman said. According to the report, Generation Z women, especially those aged 18 to 24, are less likely than young men to identify with a faith or to believe in a higher power.\n\nAccording to the Pew Center, the shift is occurring primarily among Protestants, 60% of whom identify as evangelical. Experts say multiple factors are driving the trend.\n\nAs with Mojica Rodríguez, some fume over gender hierarchies, the inability of women to serve in influential positions, or expectations of chastity placed upon girls. Others, they say, struggle with their church’s positions on reproductive and/or LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n\"Young women are moving farther left politically,\" said Ryan Burge, an associate professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, who has examined the trend.\n\nAs partisanship becomes the prime lens through which many Americans see the world, Burge said, it has infiltrated the church environment, leaving many young women disillusioned and caught between their politics and church expectations.\n\nShould the trend continue, it could have major repercussions for faith communities: Women are often the backbone of their congregations, fueling volunteer efforts and instrumental in engaging their families in the faith.\n\n\"Women do the majority of the work that keeps the church going,\" said former evangelical Sheila Wray Gregoire, who’s studied Christian marriage in the U.S. and Canada for 17 years. \"They’re the ones responsible for getting children out of bed and going to church. They’re the ones staffing the Sunday school, making sure potlucks happen or that people are supported when they have an illness or are having a baby. The church is not going to survive without women.\"\n\n'An emerging area of concern'\n\nBurge, of Eastern Illinois, pored through biennial data compiled by the Cooperative Election Study, a national online survey of more than 50,000 people. The numbers showed that since 2012, the share of young women who identify as agnostic, atheist, or “nothing in particular” has edged closer to and eventually overtaken that of young men.\n\nHe said the trend can’t be written off as an anomaly.\n\n“It’s an emerging area of concern,” Burge said. “Right now the ‘check engine’ light is coming on – not every time you start the car, but sometimes. And you don’t know whether it will fix itself or get worse.”\n\nLikewise, the Survey Center on American Life’s 2023 survey of 5,400-plus adults found men represented 54% to 57% of Baby Boomer, Generation X and Millennial individuals who had left their childhood faith.\n\nAmong Generation Z, however, the pattern has flipped: 54% of those who’d left the church are female, Meanwhile, nearly four in 10 Gen Z women identify as religiously unaffiliated, compared to a third of Gen Z males.\n\nOne statistic showed the vast difference between young women and their elders: While the share of religiously unaffiliated men was 11 points greater among Gen Z than Baby Boomers (34% to 23%), young women were nearly three times as likely than Baby Boomer women to identify as such (39% to 14%).\n\nThe issues that drive young women away from the church\n\nResearchers say there’s usually not just one reason women leave the church. Higher levels of education, career goals and deprioritizing of marriage and parenthood can play a role; alternately, so too can the economic pressures of parenthood as the cost of living rises.\n\nMatters of principle may provide the final push. According to the Survey Center on American Life, Generation Z women are far more concerned than previous generations with inequality and scornful of institutions adhering to patriarchal hierarchies – including more conservative churches, where women are not allowed to preach or hold leadership positions.\n\n“There’s a cultural dissonance with young women being told you can do anything and then being told, well, generally, yes, but when it comes to our place of worship there’s restrictions,” Cox said. “That’s another challenge that these places are wrestling with.”\n\nWhile many denominations now allow the ordination of women, how such policies play out in practice can differ at the local level, where pastors may follow the lead of congregants resistant to such change.\n\n“Why would you want to be at a place where your voice doesn’t matter?” said Gregoire, the former evangelical. “It’s hard when you grow up with a deep, personal faith and then the church you’re in treats you as less than. It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you.”\n\nAs incidents of sexual assaults or indiscretions involving church elders have increasingly come to light, the rise of the #MeToo movement and its religious equivalent, #ChurchToo, has “empowered young women to say, I don’t need to put up with this anymore,” Burge said.\n\nTim Whitaker, director and founder of The New Evangelicals, a digital nonprofit for former evangelicals rethinking their faith, said notions of “purity culture” and “modesty culture” – requiring girls to be chaste and dress modestly – are deeply embedded in some evangelical churches.\n\n“I’ve been told that girls as young as 10 are told, ‘Your dress is too short,’” he said.\n\nPurity culture, Gregoire said, teaches that women are responsible for men’s lustful thoughts. That’s one reason she launched Bare Marriage, a podcast and research effort examining the marital and sexual satisfaction of evangelical women in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n“The way a woman dresses can cause a man to stumble – that’s the phrasing they use,” Gregoire said. “Because of that language, and because churches aren’t good at teaching about consent, if girls are sexually assaulted they can feel like it’s their fault because ‘he’s just a man.’”\n\nSuch ideas, she said, are pushed in books targeted at teens, young men and parents and distributed by pastors during premarital counseling sessions or presented by peers at bridal showers.\n\n“It isn’t from the pulpit all the time,” said Rebecca Lindenbach, Gregoire’s daughter and partner at Bare Marriage. “But they have curricula with recommended readings. That’s how these things get propagated.”\n\nIn general, Gregoire said, church attendance benefits women, contributing to higher marital satisfaction and fewer mental health issues. But it becomes harmful when women internalize what she calls “toxic teachings,” such as that a woman should have frequent sex with her husband to keep him from watching pornography.\n\nSuch teachings, she said, persist on the conservative fringes of Southern Baptist and independent fundamentalist Baptist circles.\n\n“Not all churches are like this,” Gregoire said. “But the way many churches handle gender, it’s a choice they’re deliberately making, and it’s turning women off in huge numbers.”\n\nMaking the break with purity culture\n\nMojica Rodríguez, the Nashville author, recalled not being permitted to have male friends or to get phone calls from anyone who wasn’t Christian. Meanwhile, while her parents allowed her brother to stay out late, she couldn’t even leave the house.\n\nShe recalled attending a youth conference where boys and girls were divided into two groups; the boys split off to discuss leadership while the girls were made to list the attributes they wanted in a good husband.\n\nAt age 20, her date with a male friend was chaperoned, and her pastor father policed such interactions with vigilance.\n\n“He would say, ‘If people can see that I can’t contain you, how will they listen to me?’” she said. “I carried the weight of purity culture.”\n\nWhen Mojica Rodríguez got married, it was to a man she had met seven months earlier.\n\n“The teaching is that you have to get married fast because lust is a powerful thing,” she said. “They sort of thrust you into marriage with strangers to keep you from the sin of fornication. As far as my mom knows, she witnessed our first kiss at the wedding.”\n\nMojica Rodríguez gradually realized her marriage also was about escape. Leaving home gave her the freedom to pursue graduate school studies at Vanderbilt University, where she was able to put the teachings of her upbringing into context. Her father had no interest in her theological views, she said, because of her gender.\n\nShe was still in the program in 2013 when she decided both to divorce herself from her husband – and her church. When she called her mother for emotional support, she said, her mother instructed her to return to her husband, with no questions about why she had left.\n\nSoon afterward, she discovered she was pregnant, suddenly faced with another difficult choice. She ultimately decided to get an abortion.\n\n“Those two things back to back went against everything I had ever been taught,” she said. “It was like, am I going to feel shame for the rest of my life, or am I going to be OK? It was hard, but it was even more heartbreaking to be so deeply misunderstood by my family and have them vilify my choices through their church lens.”\n\nHow will churches respond to the crisis?\n\nWhitaker, of The New Evangelicals, said while many of these issues affect women broadly, young women have fewer ties to the church than their older peers who are more established with families and community bonds.\n\nHe partly credits the exodus of young evangelical women to the rise of social media spaces that facilitate the sharing and affirmation of discontent. His organization, which launched in 2022, built an audience on Instagram and now has about 116,000 followers, about 70% of them women.\n\n“These platforms have given them a place to express their thoughts and be heard,” he said. “Seeing other people’s stories, and seeing them make the change, has given them permission to take seriously their own concerns.”\n\nWhitaker hears mostly from those who have left white evangelical churches but doubts many institutions will adapt to stem the tide.\n\n“A lot of them think God has given them clear commands around sexuality, gender and hierarchy, so when people leave for those reasons they see them as defecting from the church completely,” he said. “I don’t think the evangelical church is going to change its tune anytime soon.”\n\nThe Rev. David Gushee, author of “After Evangelicalism: The Path to a New Christianity” and a professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, said that while some evangelical leaders are trying to respond constructively, “others are tripling down on toxic masculinity. It’s very sad, really.”\n\nTod Bolsinger, an ordained Presbyterian pastor who runs a consulting firm working with churches trying to navigate a changing world, said most are struggling to determine their identity moving forward.\n\n“The challenge is that you’ve got to get really clear on what is so deeply important that it will never change and be prepared to change everything else,” he said.\n\nBolsinger, an associate professor of leadership formation at Fuller Seminary in Pasadena, California, said cultural shifts mean church leaders can no longer rely on old ways of thinking.\n\n“For generations, people would say young adults will leave, but when they get married and get their babies baptized, they’ll come back,” he said. “No longer. You have to have something to offer people … If we are losing the people who have historically been the most loyal, that’s a four-alarm fire.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/05/13/nones-americans-christians-evangelicals-column/27198423/", "title": "Survey fail - Christianity isn't dying: Ed Stetzer", "text": "Ed Stetzer\n\nA new Pew Research Center survey found the Christian share of the American population declined almost 8 percentage points from 2007 to 2014. Drawing from this point, many continued their breathless claims that the Christian sky is falling.\n\nRather than predict the impending doom of the church in America, this latest study affirms what many researchers have said before. Christianity isn't collapsing; it's being clarified. Churches aren't emptying; rather, those who were Christian in name only are now categorically identifying their lack of Christian conviction and engagement.\n\nGallup recently found that weekly religious attendance as a percentage of the U.S. population is about where it was in the 1940s — hardly a statistical collapse.\n\nSimply put, the strains of a funeral dirge aren't being played at the graveside of American Christianity because there is no body for burial.\n\nEvangelicalism is growing\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nYes, you read that correctly. Evangelical Christianity is growing in America. From 2007 to 2014 the number of evangelicals in America rose from 59.8 million to 62.2 million, according to Pew.\n\nWhile it should be noted that evangelicals' share of the overall U.S. population dropped by 9 percentage points over the last seven years based on denominational affiliation, the percentage of U.S. adults who self-identify as evangelical or born-again rose from 34 to 35% over the same period of time. Don't miss that: More than one-third of Americans call themselves evangelical.\n\nAnd despite what many are saying, evangelicals are attending church more than ever. The latest (2014) General Social Survey found that in the last two years of the study a greater percentage of evangelicals are attending church than in any other time of the last 40 years. Currently, 55 percent of evangelicals attend church at least nearly every week.\n\nThis is part of the growing \"evangelicalization\" of American Christianity in which the church in the U.S. is increasingly taking on the attributes of evangelicalism. According to Pew, half of all Christians self-identify as an evangelical or born again.\n\nSo why is Christianity shrinking?\n\nIf evangelical Christianity is growing, or at the very least remaining steady, why is Christianity as a whole shrinking and why are those who claim no religious affiliation increasing at such a rapid rate? In short, nominals — people whose religious affiliation is in name only — are becoming nones — people who check \"none of the above\" box on a survey.\n\nThose who value their faith enough to wake up on Sunday morning and head to their local church are mostly still going. What I have described as \"convictional Christianity\" will continue. Those who say their faith is very important to their lives are not suddenly jettisoning those beliefs to become atheists.\n\nAccording to Pew, unaffiliated Americans grew from 16 to nearly 23% in the last seven years. That increase largely came from the ranks of Catholics and Mainline Protestants, religious traditions with high numbers of nominals. Among adults who claim no religious affiliation, 28% were raised Catholics, while 21% grew up Mainline.\n\nMany of these who have been labeling themselves as Christians are starting to feel free to be honest about their religious affiliation, or lack thereof. Jewish, Muslim or Hindu are no longer the only religious survey options passed over for many Americans. Christianity has joined the list.\n\nSo, the number of people who are practicing a vibrant faith is not fading away, quite the contrary. Christianity and the church are not dying, but they are being more clearly defined. Both the recent Pew and GSS data affirm this clarification should only continue.\n\nNominal Christians are becoming the nones and convictional Christians remain committed. It is fair to say we are now experiencing a collapse, but it's not of Christianity. Instead, the free fall we find is within nominalism.\n\nThat's the real story of this data and one that needs to be told. The nominals are becoming the nones.\n\nEd Stetzer is the executive director of LifeWay Research.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

The last two reports were in 2014 and 2007.\n\nAccording to the new study, 62% of U.S. adults identify as Christian, 29% are religiously unaffiliated, often called “nones,” and 7% identify as other religions including Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. The share of Christians is down by 9 percentage points from a decade ago and the religiously unaffiliated up by 6 percentage points, though Pew researchers said it’s a complex trend.\n\n“One of the big takeaways is … we’re seeing recent stabilization within American Christianity amid a much longer period of decline,“ Greg Smith, Pew senior associate director, said in a news conference last week.\n\nFew other reports offer as comprehensive a picture of American religion, with the next closest being the Public Religion Research Institute’s American Values Atlas. The new Religious Landscape Study and an interactive online tool, based on research conducted in 2023-24, outline many major trends in the U.S.\n\nGenerational differences such as the fact younger Americans are less religious than older ones drive many of the trends assessed in the study.\n\n“That means for lasting stability to take hold in U.S. religion, something would need to change,\" Smith said.\n\nOther recent religion, politics stats:Evangelical Christians support refugees, despite mixed views on immigration, survey finds\n\nNondenominational evangelical growth\n\nDespite steady rates of interest in certain spiritual practices and ideas across various demographics, major U.S. religious institutions continue to falter.\n\nPew reported the four top categories of Christian adults have all declined. Those categories are:\n\n23% of U.S. adults identify as evangelical Protestants, down from 25% in 2014\n\n19% are Catholic, down from 21% in 2014\n\n11% are mainline Protestant, down from 15% in 2014\n\n5% are part of historically Black Protestant traditions, down from 6% in 2014\n\nThe most direct hits have been to Protestant denominations, though not necessarily to all Protestant identities.\n\nSmaller percentages of U.S. adults identify with top Protestant denominations. But defying that downward spiral are nondenominational evangelicals, a group that’s deeply religious but doesn’t necessarily embrace denominational labels. The \"nondenominational evangelical family\" grew by one percentage point since 2014.\n\n“It’s always been the case that many people choose a local congregation in part based on pragmatic considerations,” Penny Edgell, a University of Minnesota sociologist and Pew expert advisor, said at the news conference. “That probably has increased. … People are in general less concerned than they used to be about religious doctrine. They are more likely to hold a set of common beliefs.”\n\nPolitics, gender and the religion of family values\n\nThe borders around common beliefs between religious versus nonreligious Americans are becoming more defined for many religious groups, a phenomenon most clearly illustrated by political attitudes.\n\nThe study found Americans that are more religious are also more likely to align with the Republican Party and associated views, while less religious Americans are more likely to identify with the Democratic Party.\n\nRace and age are important contributors to these differences in political views among different religious identities, but so are gender and views about gender roles.\n\nThough women continue to be more religious than men, the study found that gap is narrowing. Edgell said that trend and the heightened political polarization between religious identities when considered together point to attitudes about traditional values and the nuclear family.\n\n“(It) has a whole lot to do with whether people are happy about, invested in and want to support traditional patriarchal gender and family arrangements, or if they want to challenge those,” Edgell said. “There is a gender, family, sexuality story that I think is driving a lot of this polarization. It’s not an effect of this polarization; it’s driving it.”\n\nLiam Adams covers religion for The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Only the historically black Protestant churches have held a steady grip through the years of change.\n\nRemember the familiar map of American religion? The South: A bastion of white evangelicals. The Northeast: Cradle of Catholics. The Midwest: Nest of Mainline Protestants. The West: Incubator of \"nones\" — people who claim no religious brand label.\n\nWell, scratch all that in the new topography.\n\nThe shrinking numbers of Christians and their loss of market share is the most significant change since 2007 (when Pew did its first U.S. Religious Landscape survey) and the new, equally massive survey of 35,000 U.S. adults.\n\nThe percentage of people who describe themselves as Christians fell about 8 points — from 78.4% to 70.6%. This includes people in virtually all demographic groups, whether they are \"nearing retirement or just entering adulthood, married or single, living in the West or the Bible Belt,\" according to the survey report.\n\nState by state and regional data show:\n\nMassachusetts is down on Catholics by 10 percentage points. South Carolina is down the same degree on evangelicals. Mainline Protestants, already sliding for 40 years or more, declined all over the Midwest by 3 to 4 percentage points.The Southern Baptist Convention and the United Methodist Church, the country's two largest Protestant denominations, are each down roughly the same 1.4 to 1.5 percentage points.Every tradition took a hit in in the West as the number of people who claim no religious brand continues to climb.\n\nChristian faiths are troubled by generational change — each successive group is less connected than their parents — and by \"switching\" at all ages, the report shows. While nearly 86% of Americans say they grew up as Christians, nearly one in five (19%) say they aren't so anymore.\n\n\"Overall, there are more than four former Christians for every convert to Christianity,\" said Cooperman.\n\nAlthough evangelicals are part of the decline, their slide has been less steep. They benefit from more people joining evangelical traditions, but they're hurt by generational change and by America's increased diversity.\n\nAccording to the survey, white \"born-again or evangelical\" Protestants — closely watched for their political clout within the GOP — now account for 19% of American adults, down slightly from 21% in 2007.\n\nPoliticians should take note, said Mike Hout, a sociologist and demographer at New York University who is also a co-director of the General Social Survey.\n\n\"Traditionally, we thought religion was the mover and politics were the consequence,\" he said. Today, it's the opposite.\n\nMany of today's formerly faithful left conservative evangelical or Catholic denominations because \"they saw them align with a conservative political agenda and they don't want to be identified with that,\" Hout said.\n\nCatholics dropped both in market share and in real numbers. Despite their high retention rate for people reared in the faith, they have a low conversion rate. Today, Cooperman said, 13% of U.S. adults are former Catholics, up from 10% in 2007.\n\nGenerational shifts are also hurting Catholic numbers. Greg Smith, Pew's associate director of research, said \"just 16% of the 18-to-24-year-olds today are Catholic, and that is not enough to offset the numbers lost to the aging and switching.\"\n\nWhere are they going? To religious nowhere.\n\nThe \"nones\" — Americans who are unaffiliated with brand-name religion — are the new major force in American faith. And they are more secular in outlook — and \"more comfortable admitting it\" than ever before, said John Green, director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.\n\nTheir growth spans the generations, as well as racial and ethnic groups, said Green, a senior fellow in religion and American politics for the Pew Research Center.\n\n\"Nones,\" at 22.8% of the U.S. (up from 16% just eight years ago) run second only to evangelicals (25.4%) and ahead of Catholics (20.8%) in religious market share.\n\nThe \"nones\" numbers are now big enough to show noteworthy diversity:\n\nAtheists rose from 1.6% to 3.1%, and agnostics from 2.4% to 4%. Combined, there are more \"nones\" than Evangelical Lutherans, United Methodists and Episcopalians all together.\n\n\"It's because we're right,\" crowed David Silverman, president of American Atheists. He hadn't yet seen the Pew findings, but commented based on other surveys he said showed nones rising numbers. Indeed, it's the public attention given to \"nones\" in the last decade, combined with the wide-open access to anti-religious discussion on the Internet, that drives the change, Silverman said.\n\n\"More people know the facts, and more people realize they are not alone,\" Silverman said. And with these shifts, the stigma of coming out as an atheist is lessening.\n\n\"It's now impossible for an atheist to think he is alone in this world. They are automatically empowered,\" said Silverman.\n\nThe bulk of the \"nones\" (15.8%, up from 12.1% in 2007) don't even commit to any view on God. Instead, they say they believe \"nothing in particular.\"\n\nBut among the \"nothings,\" there's a distinct split between \"spiritual\" and totally indifferent \"nones.\"\n\nThirty percent of all \"nones\" still showed \"a sort of religious pulse\" by saying that religion is still at least somewhat important to them, said Cooperman.\n\nHowever, the bulk of this group (39%) are not agnostic, atheist or vaguely spiritual — they're just not interested. Religion is not even somewhat important to them.\n\nThat same level of disinterest cuts into their social and political clout, said Hout.\n\nThe nothing-in-particular folks \"don't vote, don't marry and don't have kids,\" at the same rate as other Americans, said Hout. \"They are allergic to large, organized institutions — mass media, religions, big corporations, and political parties.\"\n\n\"None\" is the winning category for religious switchers across society, particularly among gay and lesbians — 41% of gay or lesbian Americans say they have no religion. Cooperman said. \"This suggests the degree of alienation and discomfort and sense of being unwelcome that they may have felt in traditional religious groups.\"\n\nOther trends of note:\n\nIntermarriage is rising with each generation. Among Americans who have gotten married since 2010, nearly four-in-ten (39%) report that they are in religiously mixed marriages, compared with 19% among those who got married before 1960, according to the report.\n\nThere's an identity gender gap. Most Christians are women (55%) and most \"nones\" are men (57%). However, women's unbelief numbers are growing: nearly one in five (19%) now say they have no religious identity.Diversity makes a difference. Racial and ethnic minorities now make up 41% of Catholics (up from 35% in 2007), 24% of evangelicals (up from 19%) and 14% of mainline Protestants (up from 9%). \"The share of Americans who identify with non-Christian faiths also has inched up, rising 1.2 percentage points, from 4.7% in 2007 to 5.9% in 2014. Growth has been especially great among Muslims and Hindus,\" the report said.\n\nThe latest survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample of 35,071 adults interviewed by telephone, on both cellphones and landlines, from June 4-Sept. 30, 2014. The margin of error on overall findings is plus or minus 0.6 percentage points.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/11/03/study-more-americans-reject-religion-but-believers-firm-faith/75084656/", "title": "Study: More Americans reject religion, but believers firm in faith", "text": "Lauren Markoe\n\nReligion News Service\n\nAmericans as a whole are becoming less religious, but those who still practice a faith are just as committed as they were in the past — in certain respects even more so.\n\nThe 2014 U.S. Religious Landscape Study, released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center, also shows that nearly all major religious groups have become more accepting of homosexuality since 2007.\n\nThe study provides some solace to those who bemoan the undeniable rise of the “nones” — people who claim no religious affiliation. “People who say they have a religion — which is still the vast majority of the population — show no discernible dip in levels of observance,” said Alan Cooperman, director of religion research at Pew.\n\n“They report attending religious services as often as they did a few years ago. They pray as often as they did before, and they are just as likely to say that religion plays a very important role in their lives,” he added. “On some measures there are even small increases in their levels of religious practice.”\n\nMore religiously affiliated adults, for example, read scripture regularly and participate in small religious groups compared to seven years ago, according to the survey. And 88% of religiously affiliated adults say they pray daily, weekly or monthly — the same percentage that reported regular prayer in the first landscape study in 2007.\n\n“We should remember that the United States remains a nation of believers with nearly 9 in 10 adults saying they believe in God,\" said Gregory Smith, Pew’s associate director of research.\n\nThat said, religious affiliation overall has ticked down by about 3 percentage points in recent years, driven mainly by growth in the share of “nones” who say they don’t believe in God. Even among Christians — 98% of whom say they believe in God — fewer believe with absolute certainty: 76% today compared with 80% in 2007.\n\nAbout 77% of adults surveyed describe themselves as religiously affiliated, a decline from 83% in 2007.\n\nPew researchers attribute these drops to the dying off of older believers, and a growing number of Millennials — those born from 1982 through early 2000s — who claim no religious affiliation.\n\nThe researchers also found that as religiosity in America wanes, a more general spirituality is on the rise, with 6 in 10 adults saying they regularly feel a “deep sense of spiritual peace and well-being,” up 7 percentage points since 2007. Also increasing: the number of people who experienced a “deep sense of wonder” about the universe, which also jumped 7 percentage points.\n\nThese trends make sense, said Andrew Walsh, a historian of American religion at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., in that religious affiliation in America today is “increasingly shaped by individual choice and less by inheritance from a family or community.”\n\nThough the current social climate, especially for young adults, allows Americans to choose not to affiliate with a religious institution, Walsh said, many “are still spiritual in some ways.”\n\nOne sign: the proliferation of yoga studios throughout the nation. Most enthusiasts of the meditative practice, which combines breathing and physical postures, are not looking to convert to Hinduism, Walsh said, but they may nevertheless find the activity spiritually gratifying.\n\nCooperman cautioned, however, against concluding that such spirituality is replacing more traditional kinds of religious experiences, such as attending religious services.\n\n“On the contrary, the people in the survey who express the most spirituality are the people who are the most religious in conventional ways,” he said, “and the respondents who are the least attached to traditional religion, including the ‘nones,’ report much lower levels of spiritual experiences.”\n\nMore striking numbers in the study describe changing Christian attitudes toward gay Americans. Though the new survey is not the first to document such change, it shows in detail how dramatically members of a broad swath of denominations — even those that officially oppose homosexuality — have shifted in their views.\n\nThe number of evangelical Protestants, for example, who said they agreed that “homosexuality should be accepted by society” jumped 10 percentage points between the 2007 and 2014 studies — from 26% to 36%. The increase for Catholics was even steeper, from 58% to 70%. For historically black Protestant churches, acceptance jumped from 39% to 51%.\n\n“Despite attempts to paint religious people as monolithically opposed to LGBT rights, that’s just not the case and these numbers prove that,” said Jay Brown, head of research and education at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the national gay rights group.\n\n“There’s growing support of LGBT people and our families, often not in spite of people’s religions but because the very foundation of their faith encourages love, acceptance and support for their fellow human beings,” he said.\n\nThe religiously unaffiliated, however, showed the highest rate of acceptance of gay Americans: 83%.\n\nOn abortion, attitudes held steady, as has been the case since the Supreme Court made abortion a constitutional right in 1973. The study shows that 53% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, with views within denominations shifting little since the first landscape study.\n\nOther findings from the study include:\n\n• A minority of Jews — 40% — and the vast majority of Muslims — 90% — say they do not eat pork, the consumption of which is forbidden by Jewish and Islamic law. Hinduism does not allow beef to be eaten, and nearly 7 in 10 Hindus (67%) say they abide by that rule.\n\n• Nearly 9 in 10 Americans say religious institutions bring people together and strengthen community bonds, and 87% say they play an important role in helping the poor and needy.\n\n• Women are more prayerful than men: 64% say they pray every day, compared with 46% of men.\n\n• On evolution, more than 62% of Americans say humans have evolved over time, while about a third (34%) say humans always existed in their present form.\n\n• Six in 10 adults, and three-quarters of Christians, believe the Bible or other holy scripture is the word of God. About 31% overall — and 39% of Christians — believe it should be interpreted literally.\n\nThe 2014 U.S. Religious Landscape Study interviewed 35,071 Americans, and has a margin of error of plus or minus less than 1 percentage point. The portion of the survey released Tuesday, which focuses on beliefs and practices, is the second of two parts. The first, released in May, found that the nation is significantly less Christian that it was seven years ago.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/05/24/christian-population-declines-others-see-growth/27892893/", "title": "Christian population declines as others see growth", "text": "Sherry P. Shephard\n\nsshephard@gannett.com\n\nIn the past few years, there's been a significant drop in the number of Americans who describe themselves as Christians.\n\nA recent Pew Research Center study shows between 2007 and 2014, the Christian population fell from 78.4 percent to 70.6 percent. The nearly eight-point drop was driven mainly by declines among mainline Protestants (from 18.1 percent to 14.7 percent) and Catholics (from 23.9 percent to 20.8 percent).\n\nBishop Michael Duca, with the Diocese of Shreveport, said he and other bishops across the United States are aware of that phenomenon.\n\n\"There is a certain number of people, not necessarily leaving the church, but simply falling away from the church as an essential element of their life,\" Duca said. \"Many people in the Catholic Church are non-practicing Catholics. They don't come to church regularly.\"\n\nDuca said the church is a living, breathing, viable kind of community.\n\n\"Overall, there has been a decline in people that are practicing and a greater percentage of people who are entering that non-practicing sector,\" he said. \"And some maybe even changing religions or moving around to different religions, trying to search out what fits their unique personal spirituality or journey. Some of those come back. Some don't.\"\n\nByron Johnson, professor of social sciences and director of the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, said there are many reasons people switch from one place of worship to another.\n\n\"For many of them it's because they're not satisfied. If my needs aren't being met here, I want to go to a church where they will be met,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a sense in which there is a competition and people will go where the best product is. Just like when you shop for clothes or food. It's not saying that people have abandoned their faith.\"\n\nRelativism and hypocrisy\n\nThe Rev. Timothy Jones, pastor of Peaceful Rest Missionary Baptist Church in Shreveport, said people are living in an age of relativism where nothing is absolute.\n\n\"All of the values that we subscribe to and embrace as normative are no longer normative. For instance, just a generation ago everyone just assumed and took it for granted that a marriage would be between a man and a woman,\" he said. \"Nobody would have ever imagined that we would be in an era where people of like gender would be in a relationship and then wanting to move that relationship to the level of marriage.\"\n\nPeople are no longer living in an era of black and white, Jones said, but are instead are gravitating to the gray areas.\n\n\"What Christianity does is it perpetuates a set of virtues and it espouses and communicates some values,\" he said. \"In a relativistic age, those things are not always embraced, and they are challenged. So that's one of the things that's going on.\"\n\nAlix Powell, 21, of Shreveport, attended church regularly until three years ago. That was about the time she began associating the word \"hypocrisy\" with religion.\n\n\"I was at church almost every Sunday and Wednesday as well,\" she said. \"My youth group met up on Mondays, I was in church three to four days a week, I was in choir for 10 years and I worked at church camps,\" she said.\n\nBut things changed after Powell began writing a paper for a philosophy class on what she believed. .\n\n\"There were certain things that contradicted themselves and I started paying closer attention to the behavior of the clergy and the higher-ups in the church and the amount of hypocrisy that there was — about how Jesus loves all of his children and yet there are people who will scream and chant and yell and scream about how God hates gay people and trans people.\"\n\nPowell, who was an Episcopalian, said she saw that same hypocrisy not only among the clergy but also in the congregation.\n\n\"There is an undeniable level of racism and prejudice in certain churches in the South,\" she said. \"There were people who would talk about how premarital sex is a sin but half the people I know who say that have slept with more people than I know.\n\n\"It just didn't make any sense. So I started looking for something else.\"\n\nSherell Jefferson, 26, is a Millennial. Her generation is at the center of the country's religious pivot.\n\n\"I am a Christian and I have a church home, but I do notice that my generation has stepped away from it due to tradition and the pressures of traditional practices, where we just want to focus more on a relationship with Christ,\" she said.\n\nJohnson said it's true Millennials attend church less often. However, once they graduate college, marry and have children, many go back to the church.\n\n\"The story that's being told is that Millennials have abandoned the faith because they hate religion and that's not true,\" Johnson said. \"What these studies want people to believe is that America is Godless.\"\n\nBeing absent from the pew doesn't always mean being absent from worship.\n\n\"I do go to my church but I also have the luxury if I'm out of town — because of technology and being able to access it online — I can tune in,\" Jefferson said.\n\nChanging religious landscape\n\nIn a written statement, Southern Baptist Convention President Ronnie Floyd said the results of the survey communicate growing evidence the greatest need in America is a spiritual awakening.\n\n\"The time is now and the hour is urgent; our churches in this nation must come together in clear agreement, visible union and extraordinary prayer for the next great awakening and to reach America and the world for Christ,\" said Floyd, pastor of Cross Church in northwest Arkansas.\n\nHowever, Johnson said in many parts of the world there is a religious awakening happening now.\n\n\"There's phenomenal growth of the church in South America and spectacular growth in Sub-Saharan Africa,\" Johnson said. \"For many years, the hub of religiosity was in the United States but it's shifted to the global south.\n\nAnd while Christianity appears to be on the decline in the United States, the unaffiliated shows the most growth (from 16.1 percent to 22.8 percent), according to the survey.\n\nOf the adult population, religious \"nones\" — those who don't identify with any organized religion — make up 19 percent of the population in the South (up from 13 percent in 2007), 22 percent in the Midwest (up from 16 percent), 25 percent in the Northeast (up from 16 percent) and 28 percent in the West (up from 21 percent).\n\nJohnson said the survey can be misleading, especially when it comes to the \"nones.\" Those being surveyed, he said, are asked to identify their religious traditions from a list of denominations.\n\n\"It's a long list and at the bottom of this list you can mark a category that says none or you can just leave it blank,\" he said. \"That's what these surveys do, that's what our survey does.\"\n\nNon-Christian faiths in the United States, which include Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism, increased from 4.7 percent to 5.9 percent.\n\nRabbi Jana De Benedetti, of B'Nai Zion Congregation in Shreveport, said one of the realities is the Southern Jewish experience is different from the rest of the country.\n\n\"When it comes to something like affiliation, the Jewish population in most Southern communities is very small and they tend to affiliate because it's a small number and we feel an obligation to preserve the Jewish presence in the community, even when we don't feel religious,\" De Benedetti said.\n\n\"Judaism is a culture, a way of life, a community, a family. The Jewish community in the South feels a need to continue that connection.\"\n\nAccording to the survey, one factor in the declining share of Christians and the growth of the \"nones\" is generational replacement. As Millennials enter adulthood, they display lower levels of religious affiliation, including less connection with Christian churches, than older generations.\n\nAnd faith isn't a priority anymore, Jones said.\n\n\"Our grandparents and great-grandparents felt a need for God, and sometimes, people who have not had a struggle don't have that same need,\" he said. \"Our world is more hedonistic. It's not about pleasing God, it's about what pleases 'me' and the focus has been on that.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees. Many have simply found a new source of spirituality.\n\nPowell found hers through a roommate's mother, a practicing Wiccan. That was the first to teach her about the belief, and it made an impact.\n\n\"I liked the liturgy of the Wiccan church and I liked the consistency of it — that it would always be the same, no matter what I was feeling or believing or doubting,\" she said. \"She practices in the name of no god but it still has the same feel. The ritualistic aspect is the same every time you do it. It's something stable and steady that doesn't change.\"\n\nJones said when the church was the only thing people had, that's what they did.\n\n\"And now there are so many options. We know that the same number of people are going to church, people are just going less,\" he said. \"The Bible says church is the body of Christ and Jesus Christ is the head of the church. How is it possible ... for him to be a part of their life if they're not a part of his body?\"\n\nTwitter: @sshephardLIFE\n\nBy the numbers\n\nAmerica's religious landscape is changing.

Manners, please\n\n(Image credit: Dominic Lipinski / WPA Pool/ Getty Images)\n\nIn May 2016, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing described President Xi Jinping’s visit to the UK as “extremely successful”. But the sentiment was not shared by Buckingham Palace’s residents.\n\nSpeaking with Metropolitan Police commander Lucy D’Orsi during a garden party at the palace, the Queen was caught on video saying that the visiting Chinese officials had been “very rude” to British ambassador Barbara Woodward. D’Orsi said it had been “quite a testing time for me”, which the Queen confirmed she was aware of.\n\nD’Orsi said she felt the officials’ behaviour was “undiplomatic”, explaining that at one point they had “walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off”. “Extraordinary,” said the Queen.\n\nThe spokesperson in Beijing was unaware “of any threats” to cancel the visit, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe Queen’s comments came a day after the then prime minister David Cameron described Nigeria and Afghanistan’s governments as “fantastically corrupt”.\n\n2. Brexit bombshell\n\nOn 8 March 2016, The Sun’s front page claimed “Queen backs Brexit”. The monarch had made “critical comments” about the EU on two separate occasions, according to the paper.\n\nIt was alleged that the monarch “let rip” at Nick Clegg during a lunch at Windsor Castle, telling the former deputy prime minister “that she believed the EU was heading in the wrong direction”. The “stinging reprimand went on for ‘quite a while’”, according to the newspaper’s source, though Clegg said he had “absolutely no recollection of it”.\n\nThe Sun said the Queen had “revealed her Eurosceptic feelings” on another occasion, telling a group of MPs gathered at Buckingham Palace: “I don’t understand Europe.” The comment was made with “quite some venom and emotion”, according to the source.\n\nThe Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) later ruled that The Sun’s headline was “significantly misleading”, but editor Tony Gallagher maintained his belief that the paper had not made a mistake.\n\n“The sources were so impeccable that we had no choice but to run the story the way that we did,” Gallagher said on Radio 4’s Today programme. “I don’t think were I doing this again tomorrow I would act in any way differently whatsoever.”\n\n3. Front-page fallout\n\n(Image credit: Adam Butler/Pool/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA “rumbling row” between Margaret Thatcher and the Queen “burst into full public view” in July 1986, when The Sunday Times ran a front page with the headline: “Queen dismayed by ‘uncaring’ Thatcher”.\n\nYears later, the editor responsible for the splash, Andrew Neil, wrote in The Times that “newspapers had already hinted” at tensions between the two over sanctions against apartheid South Africa. But the report “went far beyond” that.\n\n“Palace officials closest to the Queen” had informed the paper of the monarch’s true feelings towards Thatcher. “Uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive”, were the words published by The Sunday Times.\n\nThe Queen’s press secretary Michael Shea later “outed himself” as the source. Neil said he had “no doubt” that Shea was “reflecting the views of the Queen and other senior members of the royal family… spiced up with a bit of his own anti-Thatcher slant”.\n\nThe press secretary was the ultimate victim of the report, resigning from his role at the palace the following year.\n\n4. Words of warning\n\nThe Queen in 2014 told members of the public she hoped Scots would “think very carefully about the future” when placing their votes in the Scottish independence referendum.\n\nThough the monarch’s comments “did not directly express a view”, The Times said they would be “interpreted by some on the No side as a plea to Scots not to base their decision on fleeting arguments”.\n\nPoliticians were warned “not to drag the Queen into the debate”, the newspaper continued. But David Cameron did just that when he inadvertently confirmed the “open secret” that the Queen was in the remain camp, said The Guardian.\n\nCameron told the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that the head of state had “purred down the line” when he called to tell her the referendum result. During an appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, the prime minister later said he was “extremely sorry and very embarrassed” for his blunder.\n\n(Image credit: Niklas Halle’n/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Sun broke what it described as an “important and interesting story” in July 2015 after obtaining footage from 1933 showing the Queen playing on the lawns of Balmoral with her mother and cousin, the future King Edward VIII.\n\n“The Queen Mother then raises her arm in the style of a Nazi salute and, after glancing towards her mother, the Queen mimics the gesture”, is how the BBC described the 17-second clip. Edward is also seen to make the salute.\n\nThe “arresting, once private image” brought accusations of “a breach of privacy” from the Buckingham Palace and arguments of “national interest” from the publisher, said the broadcaster’s former royal correspondent Peter Hunt. The palace said it was “disappointing” that the film, supposedly from the Queen’s family archive, had “been obtained and exploited” by The Sun.\n\nThe paper’s managing editor at the time told the BBC that the footage was a matter of “national, historical significance” from which “we shouldn’t shy away”.\n\nShould the clip have seen the light of day?\n\n6. International omission\n\nIn 2011, a Labour minister’s ex-girlfriend alleged that the topic of Turkey becoming a member of the European Union had elicited some unsavoury comments from the monarch.\n\nAuthor and broadcaster Joan Smith attended a Christmas party at the palace with her then partner Denis MacShane, and deigned to break royal protocol when she “refused to make a curtsy” for the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh, according to The Telegraph.\n\nSmith claimed that she then overheard a guest tell the monarch “we are hoping Turkey will come in” to the European Union “soon”.\n\n“Oh, we don’t want Turkey to come in for a long time” was the Queen’s alleged retort.\n\nA courtier told the newspaper that “while it is not beyond the realms of possibility” that the comment had been made by the monarch, “it may have been taken out of context”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Jamie Timson", "Sorcha Bradley", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Hollie Clemence", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html", "title": "90% of US adults say mental health is a crisis in the United States ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn overwhelming majority of people in the United States think the country is experiencing a mental health crisis, according to a new survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nNine out of 10 adults said ​they believed that there’s a mental health crisis in the US today. Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan declared last month that the country was “in the endgame” of the pandemic and described Modi as an “example to the world”.\n\nFuelled by “a cocktail of hubris, complacency and nationalist politics”, Modi “was determined to open up an economy that had taken a battering” during the pandemic, the newspaper continues. But the result has been a “Covid apocalypse” that is being “exacerbated by a slow domestic vaccine rollout, an ill-equipped health system, lax protection, pandemic fatigue and promotion of the economy over containment”, as well as the new double mutant variant of the virus.\n\nThe rapid collapse of India’s healthcare system “came as no surprise” to Abdul Fathahudeen, a critical care expert based in Kerela, who told The Times that he had warned “in February that Covid had not gone anywhere and a tsunami would hit us if urgent actions were not taken”.\n\n“A false sense of normalcy crept in and everybody, including people and officials, did not take measures to stop the second wave,” he said. “Sadly, a tsunami has indeed hit us now.”\n\nThe “unprecedented surge” in deaths has seen families of victims “forced to store their dead at home as crematoriums are overwhelmed and hospitals struggle to function”, The Telegraph reports.\n\nThe paper’s India correspondent, Joe Wallen, tweets that he is being inundated with calls from acquaintances and people previously interviewed about the pandemic who are now “asking for help in hospital admission, finding an ICU bed, in getting tested, or securing [and] delivering medicines”.\n\nAs the virus continues to spread, the government in New Delhi has also requested international assistance in tackling the health crisis.\n\nBritain yesterday pledged to send vital medical equipment including 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators and 20 manual ventilators. And the US may provide oxygen supplies, Covid tests, drug treatments and personal protective equipment (PPE), as part of aid measures being considered by the Joe Biden administration.\n\nAnthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that “it’s a terrible situation that’s going on in India and other lower middle-income countries, and there is more we can do”.\n\nMissing dead\n\nAlthough India is already reporting almost half of the world’s new Covid cases, the true scale of the health disaster may be even greater, according to interviews conducted by the NYT at “cremation grounds across the country”.\n\nThe claims have been backed up by analysts, who told the paper that “nervous politicians and hospital administrators may be undercounting or overlooking” deaths, with crematoriums where “the fires never stop” hinting at “an extensive pattern of deaths far exceeding the official figures”.\n\n“It’s a complete massacre of data,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. “From all the modelling we’ve done, we believe the true number of deaths is two to five times what is being reported.”\n\n“Deaths in India have always been counted poorly,” according to The Times of India, which says the “vast majority of deaths” in rural areas went uncounted “even before the pandemic”. And the speed with which the virus has spread has made mortality data even more “difficult to accurately assess”.\n\nThe paper cites the example of Lucknow, the capital city of India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. The official Covid death toll for Lucknow between 11 and 16 April was 145. But “just two of the city’s main crematoriums reported more than 430 or three times as many cremations under Covid-19 protocol in that period”.\n\nOther newspapers across India and further afield are reporting similar discrepancies. A recent frontpage of The Hindu claimed that “Covid-19 deaths in Gujarat far exceed government figures”.\n\nAnd a recent survey by the NYT of the main Covid cremation and burial grounds in the city of Bhopal, in central India, revealed a total of more than 1,000 Covid deaths over 13 days in mid-April when only 41 were recorded officially.\n\nDr. G.C. Gautam, a cardiologist based in Bhopal, told the paper that the authorities were suppressing the true number of fatalities because “they don’t want to create panic”.\n\n“Many deaths are not getting recorded and they are increasing every day,” he warned.", "authors": ["Joe Evans", "Last Updated", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Devika Rao", "David Faris", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/tech/tiktok-teens-study-trnd/index.html", "title": "TikTok may push potentially harmful content to teens within minutes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTikTok may surface potentially harmful content related to suicide and eating disorders to teenagers within minutes of them creating an account, a new study suggests, likely adding to growing scrutiny of the app’s impact on its youngest users.\n\nIn a report published Wednesday, the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that it can take less than three minutes after signing up for a TikTok account to see content related to suicide and about five more minutes to find a community promoting eating disorder content.\n\nThe researchers said they set up eight new accounts in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia at TikTok’s minimum user age of 13. These accounts briefly paused on and liked content about body image and mental health. The CCDH said the app recommended videos about body image and mental health about every 39 seconds within a 30-minute period.\n\nThe report comes as state and federal lawmakers seek ways to crack down on TikTok over privacy and security concerns, as well as determining whether the app is appropriate for teens. It also comes more than a year after executives from social media platforms, TikTok included, faced tough questions from lawmakers during a series of congressional hearings over how their platforms can direct younger users – particularly teenage girls – to harmful content, damaging their mental health and body image.\n\nAfter those hearings, which followed disclosures from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen about Instagram’s impact on teens, the companies vowed to change. But the latest findings from the CCDH suggest more work may still need to be done.\n\n“The results are every parent’s nightmare: young people’s feeds are bombarded with harmful, harrowing content that can have a significant cumulative impact on their understanding of the world around them, and their physical and mental health,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the CCDH, said in the report.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson pushed back on the study, saying it is an inaccurate depiction of the viewing experience on the platform for varying reasons, including the small sample size, the limited 30-minute window for testing, and the way the accounts scrolled past a series of unrelated topics to look for other content.\n\n“This activity and resulting experience does not reflect genuine behavior or viewing experiences of real people,” the TikTok spokesperson told CNN. “We regularly consult with health experts, remove violations of our policies, and provide access to supportive resources for anyone in need. We’re mindful that triggering content is unique to each individual and remain focused on fostering a safe and comfortable space for everyone, including people who choose to share their recovery journeys or educate others on these important topics.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the CCDH does not distinguish between positive and negative videos on given topics, adding that people often share empowering stories about eating disorder recovery.\n\nTikTok said it continues to roll out new safeguards for its users, including ways to filter out mature or “potentially problematic” videos. In July, it added a “maturity score” to videos detected as potentially containing mature or complex themes as well as a feature to help people decide how much time they want to spend on TikTok videos, set regular screen time breaks, and provide a dashboard that details the number of times they opened the app. TikTok also offers a handful of parental controls.\n\nThis isn’t the first time social media algorithms have been tested. In October 2021, US Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s staff registered an Instagram account as a 13-year-old girl and proceeded to follow some dieting and pro-eating disorder accounts (the latter of which are supposed to be banned by Instagram). Instagram’s algorithm soon began almost exclusively recommending the young teenage account should follow more and more extreme dieting accounts, the senator told CNN at the time.\n\n(After CNN sent a sample from this list of five accounts to Instagram for comment, the company removed them, saying they all broke Instagram’s policies against encouraging eating disorders.)\n\nTikTok said it does not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide or self-harm. Of the videos removed for violating its policies on suicide and self-harm content from April to June of this year, 93.4% were removed at zero views, 91.5% were removed within 24 hours of being posted and 97.1% were removed before any reports, according to the company.\n\nThe spokesperson told CNN when someone searches for banned words or phrases such as #selfharm, they will not see any results and will instead be redirected to local support resources.\n\nStill, the CCDH says more needs to be done to restrict specific content on TikTok and bolster protections for young users.\n\n“This report underscores the urgent need for reform of online spaces,” said the CCDH’s Ahmed. “Without oversight, TikTok’s opaque platform will continue to profit by serving its users – children as young as 13, remember – increasingly intense and distressing content without checks, resources or support.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/business/tiktok-search-engine-misinformation/index.html", "title": "TikTok's search engine repeatedly delivers misinformation to its ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen a TikTok user searches the social media app for information on top news stories, ranging from Covid-19 vaccines to school shootings, nearly 20% of the videos presented as search results contain misinformation, according to a research report published Wednesday.\n\nResearchers at NewsGuard, a journalism and technology tool that tracks online information, searched TikTok and Google this month for information on major news topics such as the 2020 presidential election, the Russia-Ukraine war and abortion to compare the misinfomation delivered by their search engines.\n\nTikTok, whose users are predominantly teenagers and young adults, “repeatedly delivered videos containing false claims in the first 20 results, often within the first five,” the report states. “Google, by comparison, provided higher-quality and less-polarizing results, with far less misinformation.”\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment on the report when contacted by CNN.\n\nThe researchers searched terms such as “mRNA vaccine” and “2022 election,” as well as controversial news topics like “Uvalde tx conspiracy.” They analyzed 540 TikTok results and found that 105 videos, or 19.4%, contained false or misleading claims, the report says.\n\nAccording to the report, a search on TikTok for information about politics, including the 2020 presidential election and the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection, often included misinformation as well as references to QAnon conspiracy theories. For example, a search for the question “Was the 2020 election stolen?” yielded six videos that contained false claims in the first 20 results, NewsGuard found.\n\nNewsGuard researchers also found that TikTok’s search engine “is consistently feeding millions of young users health misinformation, including some claims that could be dangerous to users’ health.” For instance, a search for “does mugwort induce abortion” receives over a dozen results that advocate for unproven herbal abortion methods.\n\nTikTok recently began removing abortion-related videos that violate its policy against medical misinformation, including those that share potentially dangerous advice about how to self-induce an abortion.\n\nIn response to the NewsGuard report, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that its community guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”\n\nTikTok ties to China under scrutiny\n\nTikTok removed more than 102 million videos in early 2022 for violating its guidelines, according to its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. But less than 1% of those videos were removed for violating the company’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines, which include misinformation, according to NewsGuard’s review.\n\nNewsGuard’s report was released amid bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests due to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests.\n\nUS officials have expressed fears that China could use Americans’ personal information to identify useful potential agents or intelligence targets, or to inform future mis- or disinformation campaigns.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas declined to commit to cut off flows of US user data to China, instead promising that the outcome of its negotiations with the US government “will satisfy all national security concerns.”\n\nTikTok does not operate in China, Pappas said, though it does have an office in China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, whose founder is Chinese and has offices in China.\n\n“I was surprised that TikTok is so much worse even than Google and worse, as a general matter as a platform, than Facebook or Twitter when it comes to this stuff,” Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, told CNN.\n\nBrill said the report’s findings are especially concerning due to the company’s ties to China and how easily children can access the app’s content.\n\n“We should take this as a warning. If I had kids of TikTok age, I would certainly want to know what they’re using as a search engine,” Brill said. “I’d be upset enough if they were relying too much on Google and coming up with reports in school that were based on what they were reading on Wikipedia.

Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.\n\n“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.\n\nCustomers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it, too.\n\nSelf-checkout is everywhere, despite its issues. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe machines are expensive to install, often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.\n\nDespite the headaches, self-checkout is growing.\n\nIn 2020, 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout, up from 23% the year prior, according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.\n\nThis raises the question: why is this often problematic, unloved technology taking over retail?\n\nMaking customers do the work\n\nThe introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers, a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.\n\nInstead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers, Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles, pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work, the model promised lower prices.\n\nShoppers at Piggly Wiggly, the first self-service supermarket, in 1918. Library of Congress/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nSelf-checkout, however, was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66%, according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.\n\nThe first modern self-checkout system, which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores, would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.\n\nCustomers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.\n\nThe technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.\n\nBut self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.\n\nIt took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets, which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.\n\nWalmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The rationale was economics based, and not focused on the customer,” Charlebois said. “From the get go, customers detested them.”\n\nA 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay,” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”\n\nThe mixed response led some grocery chains, including Costco (COST), Albertsons and others, to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.\n\n“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes, coupons, payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions,” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.\n\nWalkaways\n\nThe move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.\n\nRetailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision, said Christopher Andrews, a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”\n\nStores have challenges with self-checkout, including higher levels of theft. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers, they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs, he said.\n\nSelf-checkout, Andrews added, “delivers none of what it promises.”\n\nIn the biggest headache for store owners, self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.\n\n“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout, losses would be 77% higher” than average, according to Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.\n\nCustomers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.\n\nSome products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce, including fruit and meat, typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.\n\n“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably,” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”\n\nOther customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item, swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak), scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.\n\nStores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features, such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors, requiring store employees to intervene.\n\n“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience,” Beck said.\n\nSelf-checkout is here to stay\n\nDespite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners, the trend is only growing.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.\n\nIt may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.\n\nAmazon has developed cashier-less Go stores. Other retailers are trying to jump in on the trend. Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nStores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers, even though there’s little evidence to support that. But, because customers are doing the work, rather than waiting in line, the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.\n\nStore owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line 02:22 - Source: CNN Business This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line CNN Business 02:22\n\n“It’s an arms race. If everyone else is doing it, you look like an idiot if you don’t have it,” said David D’Arezzo, a former executive at Dollar General, Wegmans and other retailers. “Once you let it out of the bag, it’s pretty difficult not to offer it anymore.”\n\nCovid-19 has also hastened the spread of self-checkout.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many customers opted for self-service to avoid close interactions with cashiers and baggers.

It was stage 4, meaning it had reached other parts of her body.\n\nThe family was blindsided.\n\n“She had had a baby 15 months prior to her diagnosis, so she’d had a million blood tests, you know, care from doctors and sonograms … and there was no indication of anything, nothing whatsoever.”\n\nWhen cancer strikes an adult under the age of 50, doctors call it an early-onset case. These cancers at younger ages are becoming more common.\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Brendan Higgins\n\nA new review of cancer registry records from 44 countries found that the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising rapidly for colorectal and 13 other types of cancers, many of which affect the digestive system, and this increase is happening across many middle- and high-income nations.\n\nThe review’s authors say the upswing in younger adults in happening in part because of more sensitive testing for some cancer types, such as thyroid cancer. But testing doesn’t completely account for the trend, says co-author Shuji Ogino, a professor of pathology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nOgino says the spike is due to an unhealthy stew of risk factors that are probably working together, some which are known and others that need to be investigated.\n\nHe notes that many of these risks have established links to cancer like obesity, inactivity, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, environmental pollution and Western diets high in red meat and added sugars, not to mention shift work and lack of sleep.\n\n“And there are many unknown risk factors as well, like a pollutant or like food additives. Nobody knows,” he said.\n\nOgino thinks the fact that so many of these cancers – eight out of 14 studied – involve the digestive system points to a big role for diet and the bacteria that live in our gut, called the microbiome.\n\n“I think this actually is an important piece because what it’s pointing to is changing exposure prevalences at early ages, that are producing earlier-onset cancers,” says Dr. Elizabeth Platz, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who also edits the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, who was not involved in the review.\n\nTake obesity. Once, it was rare. Not only has it become more common to have a dangerously high body mass index, but people are becoming obese earlier in life, even in childhood, so these cancer risks are building decades earlier than they did for previous generations.\n\nAn explosion of colorectal cancer in younger adults\n\nThe surge in early-onset colorectal cancer – the cancer dos Reis Nunes had – has been particularly steep.\n\nOgino’s review found that across the years of the study, the average yearly climb in colorectal cancer in young adults was about 2% in the US, Australia, Canada, France and Japan. In the UK, it’s almost 3% per year in England, Scotland and Wales. In Korea and Ecuador, it is roughly 5% per year.\n\n“It doesn’t seem big, but you can think about inflation: If it’s 2% every year, it’s going to be a big change in 10 years or 20 years, you know?” Ogino said. “It’s not trivial.”\n\nBetween 1988 and 2015, those yearly upticks pushed the rates of early colorectal cancers from nearly 8 per every 100,000 people to almost 13 per 100,000 – a 63% increase, according to another recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudies show that about 1 in 10 colorectal cancers in the US is diagnosed in someone who is between the ages of 20 and 50.\n\nThe younger you are, the higher the risk\n\nOgino’s review found something called a cohort effect, meaning the risk of an early-onset cancer has increased for each successive group of people born at a later time. Those born the 1990s have a higher risk of developing an early-onset cancer in their lifetime than those born in the 1980s, for example.\n\nOther malignancies going up in younger Americans include those in the breast, endometrium, gall bladder and bile duct, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, stomach and plasma cells in the blood – a cancer called myeloma.\n\nDr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, calls the review “a call to arms.”\n\nCancer is a serious diagnosis at any age, but when it shows up in younger adults, the tumors are typically more aggressive, and they often go undetected for longer because routine cancer screening isn’t recommended for some of the most common cancer types, such as breast and prostate, until age 50.\n\n“Not only were these early-onset type of cancers more likely to be diagnosed when the tumor is at a more advanced stage, it was also in some of the reports that were tabulated here associated with worse survival outcome,” Knudsen said.\n\n‘Not an old person’s disease anymore’\n\nDos Reis Nunes started treatment in 2017 at Sloan Kettering and Mount Sinai cancer centers in New York.\n\nHer husband remembers the doctors explaining that she was one of a growing number of younger patients they were seeing.\n\n“I recall it being a point of discussion in both hospitals that people getting colon cancer were getting younger and younger, more and more, and they couldn’t explain it,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins says he spent a lot of time in online support groups, looking for answers and comfort.\n\n“And there were a lot of young people in those groups,” he said. “It wasn’t populated by people in their 50s and 60s. It’s like 30s, 40s, 50s. So I was very conscious that this wasn’t an old person’s disease anymore,” he said.\n\nIn fact, routine screening – with colonoscopies and tests that check for blood in stool – has driven down cases of colorectal cancer and made it less fatal in older adults, even as cases have soared in those under 50.\n\nKnudsen says three things should happen in the wake of large, definitive reviews like this one.\n\n“One is a call for research so that we truly do understand some of the specific trends that we are seeing,” she says.\n\nSecond, she wants to see more awareness of the risks, which will hopefully help people modify their behavior to control what risks they can.\n\nThird, she says, groups that make recommendations for cancer screenings should re-evaluate when those screenings should start. It could be that some should start at younger ages.\n\nIn fact, that’s already happening.\n\nLast year, the rising incidence of colon cancer in younger adults prompted the US Preventive Services Task Force to lower the age at which it recommends doctors start screening people for colon cancer to 45.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“If you’re heading to 45, you should really be thinking about this and not waiting until 50 or 55,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins said his wife’s first 12 months of cancer treatment were almost miraculous, “like remarkable reactions to the chemo.”\n\n“And then – I read about this actually – it can unravel really quickly,” he said. “And once it started unraveling, it just went downhill extremely quickly.”\n\nHis wife died in 2019, leaving behind their daughter, Maeve, who had not yet turned 4, an 11-year-old and a 20-year-old.\n\n“We had a great love story,” he said. “I’m still bitter. Still angry.\n\n“Life is OK. Everybody is fine. But I’m like, deep down, I’m seething that it happened to her.

He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities.

Claudia Greco/Reuters In pictures: Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nSunak has also been scrutinized over the tax arrangements of his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nEarlier this year, Sunak and Murty appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s 250 wealthiest people – the newspaper estimated their joint net worth at £730 million ($826 million).\n\nSunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of what has been a speedy rise to power. He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls.

The humble Q-tip was so perfectly designed for this purpose that it turned into a generic word for a product.\n\nYet, somehow, we use it for the very thing it specifically warns us not to do.\n\n‘Q-Tips Baby Gays’\n\nThe origins of this strange consumer phenomenon can be traced to Leo Gerstenzang, an immigrant from Poland.\n\nIn 1923, Gerstenzang supposedly thought he could improve upon his wife Ziuta’s method of wrapping a wad of cotton around a toothpick to clean their newborn daughter Betty’s eyes, ears, belly button and other sensitive areas during bathing.\n\nGerstenzang started a company that year to develop and manufacture the first ready-made sterilized cotton swabs for baby care. Over the next couple of years, he worked to design a machine that could produce swabs “untouched by human hands.”\n\nA Q-tips advertisement from 1945. Q-tips were originally designed for baby care. The Tampa Tribune\n\n“Baby Betty Gays” was the original working name for the swabs because daughter Betty laughed when her parents tickled her with them, according to her 2017 paid obituary. By the time Gerstenzang put out one of the first newspaper advertisements for his invention in 1925 it was shortened to “Baby Gays.”\n\nSoon, Gerstenzang changed the brand name to “Q-Tips Baby Gays.” By the mid-1930s, “Baby Gays” was dropped from the name.\n\nThere are competing histories to where the “Q-tips” addition came from. According to a spokesperson for Unilever (UL), the consumer goods conglomerate that bought Q-tips in 1987, the “Q” stands for “quality” and “tips” describes the cotton swab at the end of the stick (the first swabs were single-sided sold in sliding tin boxes).\n\nBut, according to Betty’s obituary, “Q-tips” was a play off “Cutie-Tips” because she was so cute as a baby.\n\n‘Adult ear care’\n\nQ-tips never told us to stick the swabs in our ear canal to clear out earwax. But, from its beginning in the 1920s, it made ear care a key focus of its marketing strategy. This trained generations of Americans to associate it with cleaning there.\n\nMid-century advertisements often featured illustrations of men and women cleaning their ears or their babies’ ears with them, including one depicting a man removing water from his ears after a swim.\n\nOld versions of boxes listed “adult ear care” as a main use for the product.\n\nEven Betty White later appeared in television spots for Q-tips in the 1970s and 1980s, promoting them as the “safest and softest” swabs on the market for your eyes, nose and ears.\n\nA Q-tips advertisement in Life Magazine from 1956. Some ads around the period showed men cleaning water out of their ears with Q-tips. Life Magazine\n\nQ-tips are almost addicting to use to clear out wax and it becomes a vicious cycle when we do so, said Douglas Backous, a neurotologist specializing in treating ear and skull conditions. Removing earwax creates dry skin, which we then want to scratch with — of course — a Q-tip.\n\nSticking Q-tips in your ears also can damage the ear canal. Most people do not actually need to remove earwax, as well, because ears are self-cleaning. Inserting a swab can traps earwax deeper inside, he said, and “you’re actually working against yourself by using it.”\n\nIt wasn’t until the 1970s, under previous owner Chesebrough-Pond’s, that Q-tips added a warning about not sticking the thing in your ear. It’s unclear what prompted this change.\n\n“The company has no details on why they did this, and our search of the records turns up no publicized case of anyone with a swab in the brain,” the Washington Post reported in 1990. “Something must have happened, and Chesebrough-Pond’s didn’t want to be blamed.”\n\nBut by the time Q-tips added that warning label, it was too late. Consumer habits had become impossible to break, and Q-tips controlled around 75% of the market for cotton swabs.\n\n“It was just accepted that that’s how people were using it,” said Aaron Calloway, the Q-tips brand manager at Unilever in 2007 and 2008.\n\n‘Beauty assistant’\n\nSo what should you use Q-tips for? The company has several suggestions. For decades, it has tried to emphasize the versatility of cotton swabs.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Q-tips were positioned as an essential tool for women’s cosmetics and beauty routines.\n\n“Mommy, do you know you can use Q-tips for many things?…You can use them yourself when using cream or make-up, too mommy!” read a 1941 print advertisement.\n\nBy the 1940s, Q-tips was marketed to women as a tool for their beauty routines. New York Daily News\n\nAnother print advertisement, a decade later, described Q-tips as a “beauty assistant” for women.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Q-tips began to tell consumers they were for more than just for babies or women – they were handy for just about any project around the house or in their lives.\n\n“For lubricating power saws and drills…guns and fishing reels…mending a tea cup and cleaning jewelery…Antiquing furniture,” read a 1971 ad.\n\nToday, there are no ears in Q-tips’ advertising. A spokesperson for the brand says 80% of consumers use Q-tips for purposes other than personal care.\n\nCNN’s Leidy Cook contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/06/25"}]}

And why are they so expensive?\n\nThe current “Egg-flation” crisis is the result of the current bird flu outbreak, which has killed off egg-laying poultry en mass since it began in January 2022.\n\nThat, combined with factors such as inflation or a change in laws and regulations, has directly impacted the average price of eggs. By the end of 2024, the average price of eggs per dozen in the U.S. was $4.10, double the cost reported in August 2023, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEggs prices are expected to rise by about 20% over the year, while overall food prices are only forecast to increase by 2.2%, according to an outlook from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe virus has infected about 150 million poultry across 50 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As a result of the spread, infected birds have been selectively slaughtered across the country, sometimes millions of birds at a single location.\n\nMore than 13 million hens have been slaughtered or lost since December, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's latest egg markets overview.\n\nThe average cost of eggs was $5.29 a dozen in late January, up from about $3.50 around the same time last year, NBC reported, citing the NIQ consumer research group.\n\nContributing: Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Betty Lin-Fisher, Eric Lagatta and Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/02/07/egg-shortage-is-chicken-meat-next/78289800007/", "title": "Is chicken meat next for shortages and soaring prices with egg crisis ...", "text": "A shortage of chicken meat isn't on the menu for the U.S., experts said, even as eggs remain relatively expensive and in short supply nationwide.\n\nAt least not due to bird flu-related shortages.\n\nStill, a lack of eggs and steep prices may lead consumers to move to other cheap forms of protein, which could lead to consumer-induced shortages and price increases, one expert told USA TODAY. Egg-laying hens and broiler chickens – poultry raised for meat – are different, said Will Strickland, an assistant extension agent for Louisiana State University's AgCenter.\n\nEgg layers \"usually never end up in our meat supply when they're done,\" Strickland said.\n\nWhile both are chickens, they are very different, explained Matt Sutton-Vermeulen, principal in the agriculture and food practice of Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm.\n\n\"You have sprinters and you have marathoners and they're not the same,\" he said.\n\nThe average price of a pound of boneless chicken breast in a U.S. city was $4.10 in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average price in November was $4.01. In December of 2023, it was $4.08.\n\nCurrent bird flu strains have been impacting egg-laying hens\n\nWhile the bird flu could affect hens and broiler chickens, the current strains affect egg-laying hens at a much higher rate.\n\nIt also has to do with how the hens and broiler chickens are raised and housed.\n\n\"The amount of birds that are on a premises for our laying facilities is a much higher number than the amount of birds that are on a premises at our broiler facilities,\" Strickland said.\n\nFor instance, some hen complexes can have 1 million-plus birds on site, while a broiler facility may have 10,000 chickens, Sutton-Vermeulen said.\n\nSo when a bird flu case shows up in an egg-laying facility and the United States Department of Agriculture orders the birds killed, it is much more devastating to the supply, Strickland said.\n\n\"When you lose 10% of a total production system in an inelastic commodity where demand doesn't go down because the prices go up, it's really tough,\" Sutton-Vermeulen said.\n\nThen, it takes much longer for new egg-laying hens to mature and be ready to produce eggs that can show up in the grocery store.\n\nIn the \"best-case scenario,\" with no more bird losses with bird flu, it could take more than nine months for the replacements of those lost hens to have eggs that show up in grocery stores, Sutton-Vermeulen previously told USA TODAY. There have already been 14 million egg-laying hens lost in the last two weeks.\n\nChickens raised as broiler chickens are born and harvested usually within 30 to 60 days, Strickland said.\n\nThe short life cycle of the broiler chicken makes it a lower potential that exposure to bird flu will have a ripple effect on the supply in the industry, Sutton-Vermeulen said.\n\n\"I am not necessarily worried right now about a (broiler) poultry shortage,\" Strickland said. \"That's not to say that something devastating couldn't happen.\"\n\nThere have been some turkey farms and duck operations that have had some cases of bird flu, but not enough to cause any worries of eventual shortages due to bird flu, Sutton-Vermeulen said.\n\nTurkeys do have a higher vulnerability because it takes longer for a turkey to grow and mature, but Sutton-Vermeulen said he is not fearing a turkey shortage when demand is highest, \"but we'll have to monitor that flock.\"\n\nHere's what we know so far:Bird flu has caused growing problems for the last year\n\nCould other food like beef and milk supplies get affected by shortages?\n\nBird flu is not having the same impact on beef and dairy cattle supplies as it is on hen-laying birds, despite a variant of the bird flu being found in dairy cows, said Sutton-Vermeulen.\n\n\"That is not a concern that I'm hearing from...the veterinarians and producers,\" he said.\n\nSutton-Vermeulen's firm, Kearney, has working relationships with people all across the food supply chains, he said.\n\n\"I don't see any other strategic vulnerabilities in the food supply system that are related to this,\" he said.\n\nAre people panic-buying?:Are consumers stockpiling eggs? What to know about egg shortage\n\nShortages, price hikes could come from switching goods and demand\n\nWhile there are no widespread worries of egg shortages affecting the markets for chicken and other foods, there still could be shortages and price increases for other foods driven by consumer behavior, said John Clear, senior director in the consumer and retail group of global professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal.\n\nThere could be ripple effects with other products, Clear said.\n\n\"It's like protein ping-pong,\" he said. Eggs have historically been a cheap source of protein for all income levels. But when people, especially those looking for a protein-rich diet, start looking for alternatives to eggs, they will move to the next cheapest form of protein in the retail chain, usually things like tuna, chicken meat and pork, Clear said.\n\nThen grocers, who may temporarily run out of stock since they weren't anticipating the ripple effect, will over-order and then there will be a surplus at the store, Clear said.\n\nIt's similar to what happened to toilet paper during the COVID-19 pandemic when consumers emptied store shelves when they feared shortages. It's called the bullwhip effect, Clear said.\n\nAlso, something to a smaller effect happened in 2021 when a bird flu outbreak caused shortages of eggs, but it wasn't to this scale, Clear said.\n\n\"We've got record high prices right now, so this is more of an extreme situation,\" he said. \"But this happened before... and the best indicator of future (consumer) behavior is past behavior.\"\n\nClear does not think consumers will transition to beef as a protein alternative as quickly as others since beef prices aren't as cheap.\n\nEgg price increases will be bigger, last in the food service market longer\n\nClear also foresees the rising prices of eggs having a bigger and longer effect on the food service industry – or any provider that is not the grocery store.\n\nGrocers can quickly change the price of eggs based on the higher costs from producers. But food service providers, from restaurants to convenience stores with prepared foods, have previous contracts for eggs in place. Those contracts don't reflect current prices. So, producers will likely prioritize getting their supplies to grocers, who can pay higher prices than food service providers, while trying to renegotiate the food service contracts, Clear said.\n\nBut restaurants can't change their menu prices every day to reflect increasing egg prices, he said. Food service providers use eggs in myriad dishes, sauces and for baking. He believes more will add surcharges to their egg products, like Waffle House, which announced a 50-cent surcharge.\n\n\"You're going to see a larger impact in food service for a longer time,\" he said.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

Beck\n\nAssociated Press\n\nOMAHA, Neb. – Those who like to indulge in a good omelet or quiche at the local cafe should prepare to pay a little more — if it's even on the menu.\n\nRestaurants are struggling to deal with higher egg prices and an inability to get enough eggs and egg products in the midst of a shortage brought about by a bird flu virus that wiped out millions of chickens on commercial farms this spring. Some restaurants are pulling especially eggy dishes off menus while others are contemplating raising prices until the supply returns to normal.\n\nGetting eggs from a smaller, local producer — which have largely been spared from the outbreak — has not protected Omaha restaurant owner Nick Bartholomew and other independently-owned eateries. His supplier's inventory has dwindled to meet demand and production is down because of testing by federal safety officials. And the restaurant's overall production costs have gone up by 15 percent in recent weeks, so he says he'll have to raise prices soon.\n\n\"We're now having to use three or four different producers and call around to different chicken farms to see what is available and when it will be available,\" said Bartholomew, whose restaurant, Over Easy, serves breakfast and lunch with a focus on local ingredients.

Some restaurants are pulling heavily egg-y dishes off menus while others are contemplating raising prices until the supply returns to normal.\n\nGetting eggs from a smaller, local producer has not protected Omaha restaurant owner Nick Bartholomew and other independently-owned eateries. His supplier's inventory has dwindled to meet demand, and production is down because of testing by federal safety officials.

Supply is moderate and demand is light.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics, which gathers retail egg prices as part of its market basket in compiling the Consumer Price Index, has released data only up to April when a dozen eggs averaged $2.07 in stores.\n\nFarms across the nation support 300 million hens in the industry with more than 35 million dead in the flu outbreak, according to Chief Executive Chad Gregory of United Egg Producers, a nationwide cooperative.\n\n\"This is by far the worst we've ever seen it,\" Gregory said.\n\nThe outbreak has cost farmers roughly 12% of the national flock, according to a study from Iowa State University's Egg Industry Center. This marks the worst outbreak since 1983.\n\nHy-Vee, which has 235 stores in eight states — Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin — said it has seen a few delays on larger-sized eggs but no significant shortages.\n\n\"Looking ahead to the coming weeks, we're hopeful that we'll continue to receive our regular supply of eggs,\" the company said in a release. Hy-Vee's egg suppliers have asked the grocery chain and other retailers to stop running egg promotions, which Hy-Vee agreed to do.\n\nHy-Vee won't stockpile eggs to maintain supplies because of the product's shelf life, the company said. Egg prices started to inch up in April.\n\n\"I really started noticing the prices going up about two weeks ago,\" said Susan Walters of Prattville, Ala., who has been making cookies and cakes for graduation presents and parties. \"With two teenage boys and me being a baker, we use a lot of eggs.\"\n\nBen Partridge, marketing coordinator for New Pioneer Food Co-op, which has three stores in Iowa, said bird flu has not affected the cooperative's supply or prices though it's something stores are bracing for.\n\nThe co-op stocks cage-free eggs from Cedar Ridge Farm in Elgin, Iowa; Farmer's Henhouse in Kalona, Iowa; and Marvin Hotz, a farmer near Iowa City, along with a specialty product from Texas. The eggs sell between $2.99 and $3.99, which has remained unchanged in the wake of the bird flu, Partridge said.\n\n\"We haven't necessarily seen anything change on our shelves for the consumer,\" Partridge said. However, the price for eggs in the co-op's offsite production kitchen has increased.\n\nThat's because the wholesale price of eggs sold in liquid form has more than doubled from 63 cents per dozen equivalent to more than $1.50.\n\n\"Prices have risen for eggs, but prices have risen more for egg products, \" said David Harley, poultry analyst for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nRestaurants and commercial operations that use on eggs, such bakers and pasta makers, are feeling the price pressure, Harley said. San Antonio-based Whataburger chain reduced its weekday breakfast hours to curb egg demand.\n\nIn California, the bird flu comes as a new law has gone into effect requiring more space in hen coops, which also may be contributing to higher prices.\n\nNickel Diner, a popular breakfast spot in Los Angeles, added a $1 surcharge to egg dishes to cope with egg prices that have doubled since January.\n\n\"In this day in age when we are trying to keep food affordable, it's making it tough,\" co-owner Kristen Trattner said.\n\nHowever, some said egg prices aren't playing a big role yet. Breakfast and lunch spot Ncounter in Tempe, Ariz., goes through up to 5,000 eggs a week.\n\n\"It potentially could have an impact, but as of right now we aren't feeling it,\" general manager Daniel Grover said.\n\nYet many consumers will be hard pressed to find a big bargain on eggs in the coming weeks.\n\n\"I think it's now safe to say that some consumers are going to see higher prices,\" said Maro Ibarburu, associate scientist and business analyst at Iowa State University in Ames.\n\nContributing: Lauren Talarico, KHOU-TV, Houston; Marty Roney, The Montgomery Advertiser; Josh O'Leary, Iowa City (Iowa) Press-Citizen.

Here's why prices are up, supply is spotty", "text": "Have you recently entered your local grocery store on the hunt for eggs, only to find they're noticeably more expensive − if you can find them at all?\n\nIt's not just your local shop. In fact, egg prices have increased nationwide by about 38% in the past year, bringing the average cost of one dozen up to $3.65 in November versus $3.37 in October and $2.14 in November 2023, according to the U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index.\n\nRemember, $3.65 is just an average. According to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the wholesale price for a carton of large eggs on the New York market rose to $6.06 a dozen. The Midwest region saw prices around $5.75 and California as high as $8.97 as of Jan. 3. In other cases, eggs are absent from shelves altogether.\n\nThe major reasons experts and consumers are pointing to? A bird flu outbreak, the rising cost of doing business, and, in some locales, changing laws. When will things start to cool down? That may be a little harder to pinpoint.\n\nFactor 1: Bird flu\n\nThe highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu, outbreak is the most obvious reason for the country's egg problem. The outbreak strain, H5N1, emerged among poultry flocks and wild birds in Europe in fall 2020 before moving to the U.S., Africa, the Middle East and Asia. It has become the largest such outbreak in the U.S.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe Agricultural Marketing Service said in a report Jan. 3 that grocery stores have seen record-high prices in retail markets across the nation, driven by \"significant outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial table egg layer flocks through December.\"\n\nAs of Jan. 6, the virus had hit more than 130 million poultry across 50 U.S. states since January 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because of the massive spread, infected birds are being culled across the U.S., sometimes numbering in the millions at a single location.\n\n\"Eggs are sold on markets as commodities, like corn and wheat, and wholesale prices for eggs are driven largely by supply and demand,\" Emily Metz, president and CEO of the American Egg Board, told USA TODAY. \"Our supply has been tight due to highly pathogenic avian influenza, which is devastating to egg farmers. In the U.S. we’ve lost more than 40 million laying hens this year to bird flu.\"\n\nWith flocks killed or declared infected, the very source of eggs, a grocery staple, is under strain.\n\n\"The supply of laying hens is diminishing while demand for eggs remains the same,\" Dallas-based economist analyst Amy Nixon told USA TODAY. \"Unfortunately, cases of H5N1 have been increasing in recent weeks, which means supply will continue to be throttled and prices will rise more.\"\n\nFactor 2: Inflation\n\nFrom farm to fridge, getting fresh eggs to the consumer requires logistics. The cost of manufacturing and shipping products has increased all around, hitting the agricultural industry hard.\n\nWith the prices of everything from gas to feed on the upswing, so too is the price of getting eggs on shelves. Average U.S. gas prices sit around $3.069 per gallon, according to AAA, which is roughly in line with average prices from a year ago, but prices are still higher than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLabor is on the rise, too, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Compensation costs for workers increased by 3.9% for the 12-month period ending in September 2024, part of a trend in labor prices that increased 4.6% for the 12-month period ending in September 2023.\n\nFactor 3: Law changes\n\nSome states, like California, are being hit especially hard by the egg crunch, and part of that is likely a result of state-level legislation.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 12, also called the Farm Animal Confinement Initiative, places restrictions on how hens, sows and veal calves can be kept.\n\nThe bill, which took effect in recent years, in part banned confinement of egg-laying hens (chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and guinea fowl) in certain areas with less than 1 square foot of usable floor space per hen.\n\nOther states, including Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, have similar laws that specifically provide animal welfare protections to egg-laying hens.\n\nThat limits how eggs can be produced and what can be sold in each state. Those that allow only cage-free products already face fewer suppliers and farms (a little more than a third of U.S. egg layers are cage-free, according to the USDA). Manufacturers and sellers also are facing a slowdown as they change operations to comply with such laws.\n\nFactor 4: Supply, demand and timing\n\nThere are other factors that contribute to the issue as well. More Americans have been craving their daily egg breakfast in the past two decades: Per capita egg consumption has increased by 4.8% since 2000, according to United Egg Producers.\n\nFarmers have mostly kept pace, increasing hen productivity over those same years with improved health and disease prevention, nutrition, genetics and flock management. But the steadily high and increasing demand can pose a problem when even a small disruption hits the supply chain.\n\nEgg demand is also somewhat seasonal and peaks around the holidays, according to the Agricultural Marketing Service, which means poor timing for the egg crisis.\n\n“The volume of eggs sold at retail has been up year-over-year for 20 consecutive months, and we’re just coming out of the winter holidays, when egg sales are highest due to holiday baking and entertaining,\" Metz said. \"These two forces (bird flu and seasonal demand) combined − tight supply and high demand − are directly causing the spike in wholesale prices we’ve seen recently. Although each retailer decides how much they’re going to sell eggs for in the store, higher wholesale prices usually impact retail prices.”\n\nWhen will egg prices come back down?\n\nSupply and prices will stabilize only when farms and producers can recover their stock of healthy laying hens. USDA market forecast reports have reflected that by decreasing production predictions for the upcoming year.\n\n“No one can predict the future, but bird flu remains an ongoing threat to our egg farms, and egg farmers are working around the clock to protect their birds, replenish supply and keep those eggs coming,\" Metz said. On a positive note, she said, farmers have a lot more experience fighting the disease now, meaning farms are able to recover faster.\n\nWith the outbreak still raging, however, it's unclear when that will happen. And things may get worse before they get better.\n\n\"We may see a sudden spike in consumer demand, especially as fear spreads amongst consumers about future price increases and egg availability,\" Nixon said. \"Many local grocery stores are already trying to get ahead of this by limiting shopper purchase amounts to two dozen. As we saw during the COVID pandemic, fear spreads as rapidly as viruses, leading to bizarre consumer hoarding behaviors.\"\n\nShe also pointed out that the spread of this strain to cattle and other animals means we may soon see a tighter supply of meat and dairy products, leading to higher prices in those categories as well.\n\n\"Being that it’s winter and the peak of flu season, this egg supply and price situation has the potential to get much worse in the next six weeks,\" Nixon said. \"In other words, it may be wise for all the health and fitness New Year's resolutioners to start seeking alternate forms of protein.\n\n\"And that weekend omelet brunch with your friends? Expect higher prices soon for that, too.\"\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/09"}]}

The vaccine makers said they will finish submitting the trial data to the US Food and Drug Administration this week.\n\nThe Phase 2/3 trial included 1,678 children who received a third vaccine dose during the period when the Omicron coronavirus variant dominated. Antibody levels tested one month after the third dose showed that the vaccine produced a similar immune response as two doses in 16- to 25-year-olds, the companies said. The data has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.\n\nMidtrial results found vaccine efficacy of 80.3% against symptomatic Covid-19 in this young age group. The companies identified 10 symptomatic cases at least seven days after the third dose. However, the efficacy rate won’t be finalized until at least 21 symptomatic cases are found in the vaccine group and compared with the number of symptomatic cases in the placebo group.\n\nThe companies said that three child-size doses for this age group were “well-tolerated” and that no new safety signals were identified.\n\n“These topline safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data are encouraging, and we look forward to soon completing our submissions to regulators globally with the hope of making this vaccine available to younger children as quickly as possible, subject to regulatory authorization,” Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.\n\nThe vaccine doses for these children are smaller than those used in older age groups. People 12 and older receive two doses of a 30-microgram vaccine, and children ages 5 to 12 receive two doses of a 10-microgram vaccine. Both of those age groups are eligible for booster doses.\n\nFor children 6 months to 5 years, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is three 3-microgram doses. The initial two doses were given three weeks apart, and the third dose was given at least two months after their second dose.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said Monday that vaccine scientists have been careful to adjust the dose for younger children to get “a good effect with a minimum of side effects.”\n\n“We’re thinking of this as a three-dose vaccine, and the preliminary data acquired during the Omicron era say it’s actually 80% effective,” Schaffner told CNN’s Brianna Keilar. “We will want to look at that very carefully, but so far, that’s good news.”\n\nChildren younger than 5 are the only age group not eligible for vaccination against Covid-19.

Non-Christians don't Scrooge on Christmas fun", "text": "Cathy Lynn Grossman, USA TODAY\n\nFollowers of other faiths and atheists, too, celebrate with trees, gifts, lights and more\n\nSeven in 10 non-Christians will give Christmas gifts and share Christmas dinner\n\nMost will put up a tree and decorate their home and some even go to church\n\nThis week was a Christmas-for-all celebration, and you need not be Christian to party.\n\nMany atheists, Hindus, Jews and Muslims joined in the December fun like pop culture tourists. They feasted, they partied and they piled gifts under Christmas trees. After all, why Scrooge on joy?\n\nIt's not that other religions lack for fun winter holy days of their own. By Christmas Eve, Jews had wrapped up eight nights of Hanukkah candle-lighting and Hindus enjoyed their Diwali lanterns in November -- both festivals of light and goodness triumphing over evil. Muslims feasted for the Eid Al-Adha in October, celebrating the patriarch Abraham's devotion to God's commands.\n\nAnd Every Day is an Atheist Holiday, boasts the latest book title from Vegas magician Penn Jillette, an outspoken unbeliever. But if his young children asked for a tree again this year, by golly (not by God) they'd get one, he says.\n\nJill Lightner and Tom Marshall, an atheist couple in Seattle, will deck their halls, hang a hot pink plaster angel atop their ornament-laden tree, top the statues by their doorway with Santa hats, and give homemade Advent calendars to neighboring kids.\n\nSuhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, hung a hand-made foam elephant, representing Ganesha, the Hindu lord of wisdom and new beginnings, on a Christmas tree in her family's Philadelphia home.\n\nSandy Silva, who is Jewish, lit the Hanukkah menorah at her Kansas City home. But when her new puppy made a holiday visit to St. Louis, it would have a red Christmas sweater if the weather turned chilly.\n\n\"I'm very much into the beauty and sparkling lights of a commercial Christmas season,\" says Silva. To her it signifies \"a belief shared by both religions that hope can burn in every heart to sustain us.\"\n\nAbout 27% of Americans do not identify with any Christian tradition. While some follow Judaism, Hinduism, Islam or other faiths or philosophies, nearly 20%, believe \"nothing in particular,\" according to 2012 research from the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.\n\nThat's no bar to partying, according to a survey of December celebrations by LifeWay Research, a Nashville,Tenn., evangelical research agency. Among people with no Christian identity, they found:\n\n-- 74% give Christmas gifts to family or friends.\n\n-- 72% gather for a Christmas dinner with loved ones\n\n-- 62% put up a Christmas tree\n\n-- 56% decorate their home\n\n-- 23% encourage belief in Santa\n\nSome even get close to the Christ-centered heart of Christmas: 11% attend a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day worship service and 9% say they encourage belief in Jesus Christ as savior. This may be because about 11% of non-Christians told LifeWay they were wed to a Christian.\n\nLifeWay Research director Scott McConnell has a theory about the 8% on non-Christians who say they buy Advent calendars to count down the days to the birth of Jesus. When he looked at Advent calendars on Amazon, he found \"only one has a nativity on it. (There are) lots of Santa, toys, and chocolate. Who wouldn't like that?\"\n\nEvery year nearly 80% of U.S. households put up a tree, according to polls commissioned by the National Christmas Tree Association. But among those who do not, only 7% cited religious reasons for skipping it. When they were asked why, most said they were traveling, too busy, no longer entertaining tots at home, or simply not in the mood for an evergreen. .\n\nJillette, whose book excoriates organized religion and touts invented dates such as \"Chiquita Banana Wednesday,\" and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland invention of the \"unbirthday,\" is in the mood for whatever his children, ages six and seven, will enjoy.\n\nIf that means a big evergreen from a Christmas tree lot, well, okay. They had a tree last year, loaded with colorful ornaments. He says, \"It was just like getting a pumpkin for Halloween -- secular fun. I'm not overly sensitive to it. It's not a third rail issue for me. If the kids want to check out a church some day, I'm okay with that, too, I like to be as inclusive as possible,\" says Jillette.\n\nHe'll be on stage with the Penn & Teller show both Christmas Eve and Christmas day before taking off for New Years. January 1 is Jillette's preferred party day \"because the calendar turns over and you start fresh.\" They launch balloons to remember loved ones who have died, feast and shower the children in gifts. \"We have already had a week to see what gifts were the most successful with their Christian and Jewish friends and then we can just swoop in and go over the top with the best.\"\n\nGifts are often the allure of Christmas-for-all spirit. There are no religious bounds on generosity.\n\nHadeel Masseoud, a Muslim mom writing for a Disney-sponsored parenting site, points out that, while, Muslims exchange gifts during their two major holidays, both known as Eid, they also respect Jesus as a prophet of God so celebrating his birth with a few more gifts \"is not technically against any Islamic principles.\"\n\nDecorations get a Muslim twist: On line companies offer dozens of Muslim ornaments including one that proclaims \"Peace be upon you\" in Arabic calligraphy.\n\nSuhag Shukla grew up with her extended Hindu family putting up lights and giving the traditional gifts of candy, jewelry and new clothing for Dwali -- then leaving the lights up through January.\n\nOn Christmas, under the family's tree (always an artificial one, she says, \"because Hinduism teaches respect for the earth) her dad or an uncle dressed as Santa Claus to distribute \"Secret Santa\" gifts among all the cousins.\n\nShukla still has the hand-me-down suit, too big for her teenage sons. While her boys got their gifts at Diwali, she says, come Christmas, they will get one or two small gifts more.\n\n\"Hinduism is a pluralistic tradition. There is a quiet confidence in knowing you can partake in celebrations with others without sacrificing your own belief that there are multiple paths to understanding the Divine,\" Shukla says.\n\nTo Jill Lightner, understanding the divine is \"irrelevant any day of the year\" but she still devotes most of December to sharing great food and giving to friends, neighbors and charities.\n\nThe couple enjoys hanging \"crazy lights everywhere\" and putting up stockings, a tree loaded with ornaments topped with a star, and a Filipino parol lantern glowing over the front door. To the faithful, a parol represents the star of Bethlehem, \"but we love it for its twinkling awesomeness,\" she says.\n\nAhem. That's not just awesomeness, says Pope Benedict XVI. On Friday, when the Christmas tree for St. Peter's Square was set up, he said its lights symbolize and recall, \"God became man and came among us to dispel the shadows of sin, bringing His divine light to humanity.\"\n\nNot everyone sees the light that way, says atheist Robert Crenshaw,a corporate training consultant and a rock band drummer. He put out an Atheist Christmas CD featuring his own compositions, liner notes that intone solemnly about the significance of the cycles of the year in nature and a photo of him as a happy tot on Santa's knee.\n\n\"You don't have to think there's a God in the sky to love Christmas. It's okay not to buy into the literal Christian meaning of the holiday,\" says Crenshaw, of Oak Park, Mich.\n\nBut \"Christmas-for-all,\" minus Christ, is a problem to those who take a serious stand on the theology of the holy day such as Rev. Michael Horton, professor at Westminster Seminary in Escondido, Calif., and host of The White Horse Inn, a radio talk show on evangelical theology theology.\n\nThe gigantic American Christmas has trivialized the birth of a savior into cultural superficiality for all, a philosophy that is \"as innocuous as possible, he says.\n\n\"When Jews or agnostics or atheists want to celebrate a winter event, that makes perfect sense. But if Christmas has come to mean something even atheists can celebrate, if it is so far removed from the birth of Christ that it no longer has a serious religious meaning,\" Horton says, \"that's not respect for Christmas, that's assimilation.\"\n\nCarin Agiman,\n\nwho calls herself a non-observant Jew, assimilated one totally secular Christmas-season tradition --the ugly sweater party.\n\nAgiman, a Berkeley, Calif., based entrepreneur, created a company, Geltfiend, to sell sweaters decorated with the spinning top and menorah -- essentials of Hanukkah -- and one of a snowman dressed as a Hassidic Jew with a black hat and side curls. \"Jews get cold, too!\" she says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/23/hajj-deaths-mecca-pilgrimage/74186340007/", "title": "1,301 Hajj participants died in pilgrimage to Mecca because of heat", "text": "The annual Muslim pilgrimage to the sacred city of Mecca that wrapped up last week became a death march for over 1,300 Hajj participants who died in temperatures that climbed above 124 degrees.\n\nSaudi Arabia's health minister Fahad Al-Jalajel, who on Sunday announced a death total of 1,301, blamed the fatalities on pilgrims \"walking long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort.\"\n\nThe 5-6 day odyssey of hiking and prayer drew almost 2 million pilgrims from around the world. Fatalities included a number of elderly people and those suffering from chronic diseases, A-Jalajel said.

We offer our sincerest condolences to the families on their loss. We stand ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance.\"\n\nEgypt to prosecute tourism companies\n\nEgyptian officials said the high number of deaths, most of them among unregistered pilgrims, stemmed from some companies that used a \"personal visit visa (that) prevents its holders from entering Mecca\" via official channels.\n\nPrime Minister Moustafa Madbouly ordered the revocation of licenses for 16 tourism companies that provided packages for Hajj pilgrims who were not registered for the event. He also instructed that the officials of these companies be referred to prosecutors and the companies be fined to compensate the families of the deceased pilgrims.\n\nAuthorities in Jordan said they, too, had detained several travel agents who arranged unofficial travel of Muslim pilgrims.\n\nHajj heat deaths:500 Egyptian pilgrims perish in 124-degree temps\n\nHajj has seen tragedy before\n\nCatastrophic deaths at Hajj are not new. A stampede in 2015 killed more than 2,200 people, and another stampede in 1990 killed over 1,400 people. Four years later a stampede killed 270 people. A tent fire in 1997 killed 347. A protest turned violent in 1998, leading to the deaths of 400 pilgrims.

In a back room, kids folded miters – the headgear of bishops and popes – out of paper. Attendees paid their way in with canned goods for a food pantry.\n\nKathy Ebner, the church’s spiritual director, said in April and May, the church started to arrange for buses to take parishioners to Philadelphia for the events. But they grew discouraged by the logistics involved, she said, and the long distances in the city people would have to walk to take part.\n\n“This didn’t sound like something a parish of mostly senior citizens could do,” Ebner said.\n\nThomas A. Flowers, the church’s pastor, said a planning council of church members came up with the idea of a Philly-themed get-together in the church hall instead.\n\n“I’m sure we’ll be quiet during the homily and the consecration,” Flowers said. “Other than that, we want people to have a good time.” – James Fisher\n\n3:48 p.m.\n\n3:46 p.m.\n\nSt. Elizabeth Ann Seton parishioner Jane Muchai staked her claim along one of the less crowded stretches of the papal parade route in Logan Square. A Delawarean for four years, and originally from Kenya, she said she missed seeing Pope John Paul II each time he visited her home country in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nAfter a two hour wait in the security line, she was worried that once again she'd miss her opportunity for a glimpse of the pontiff.\n\nBut as yells from the crowd grew louder around the square, she could tell that Pope Francis was approaching.

Plus, why it's celebrated, holiday ...", "text": "Ramadan is less than a month away.\n\nBefore the holiday commences, we have put together a refresher to help you understand what Ramadan is, why it is celebrated and more.\n\nWhat is Ramadan?\n\nRamadan is one of the holiest months of the year for Muslims.\n\nDuring the monthlong holiday, Muslims commemorate the revelation of the Quran (the holy book of Islam) when Allah, through the angel Gabriel, revealed the first verses of the Quran to a caravan trader named \"Muhammad,\" according to Almanac.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nRamadan is also a time for fasting from drinking or eating during sunlight hours to draw closer to God and cultivate self-control, gratitude, and compassion for the less fortunate, according to ING.\n\nWhen is Ramadan in 2024?\n\nAlthough Ramadan is always the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, the exact dates of the holiday change each year because they are based on the sighting of the first crescent moon over Mecca, Saudi Arabia, on the last night of the eighth month, Sha’ban. Some choose to observe Ramadan by following pre-determined dates based on astronomical calculations, reports Almanac.\n\nIn 2024, Ramadan starts at sundown on Sunday, March 10, and ends at sundown on Tuesday, April 9.\n\nThe last evening of Ramadan is Eid al-Fitr (Festival of Breaking the Fast), which is celebrated during the first three days of Shawwal, the 10th month in the Islamic calendar, according to the Pluralism Project.\n\nEid al-Fitr does not begin until the new moon is seen, which means it starts at different times around the world. Some Muslims choose to celebrate when the new moon appears over Mecca. During Eid al-Fitr, the monthlong fast for Ramadan officially ends and is celebrated with a feast.\n\nHow is Ramadan celebrated?\n\nRamadan is a period of spiritual rejuvenation, focusing heavily on devotion. During the month, Muslims perform special prayers and spend extra time reading the Quran, along with fasting.\n\nThe fast is from pre-dawn to sunset each day, lasting between 11 and 16 hours for 29 to 30 days, depending on the time of year. Muslims fast from food and drink; abstain from sex, if married; and refrain from negative acts such as lying, gossiping, arguing or backbiting, according to ING.\n\nThe goal of fasting is to gain “greater God-consciousness,” known in Arabic as “taqwa,” signifying a state of constant awareness of God. This awareness allows a person to gain self-restraint, discipline and a greater incentive to avoid wrong and do good.\n\nAll post-pubescent Muslims are obligated to fast except those with exemptions, including someone who is pregnant or nursing, children, sick individuals and elderly people. Sick people can make up the fast when they feel better and can instead feed a poor person for every day of fasting that they miss. Children around age 7 can perform limited or symbolic fasts, such as fasting for half a day or on weekends.\n\nDue to fasting, the holiday is a highly social time and often sees the community inviting one another over for breakfast and meeting up for prayers at the mosque.\n\nSehri, or suhri, is the pre-dawn meal families eat together every morning, followed by a morning prayer. At night, Muslims break their fast with a meal known as “iftar,” which is traditionally started by eating dates like the Prophet Muhammad is believed to have done to break his fast. Iftar is often shared with a poor family, according to Almanac.\n\nA special part of Ramadan is the Night of Power, known as Lailat al-Qadr, that is believed to fall on one of the odd nights during the last 10 days of Ramadan but is widely observed on the 27th night. It is seen as the most blessed night in Ramadan because it is said to be the night the Quran was first revealed, according to Britannica.\n\nMosques are open all night on the Night of Power as Muslims hold vigils in contemplation, prayer and Quranic recitation.\n\nOnce Eid al-Fitr arrives, the last day of Ramadan, Muslims enjoy great feasts and celebrate with the community.\n\nRamadan traditions\n\nIt is customary for Muslims to attempt to read the entire Quran during Ramadan and have it recited during special nightly prayers, according to ING.\n\nDuring the nightly meal, mosques are known to host community dinners to foster relationships and offer a break from cooking to those fixing up iftar at home. Afterward, special Ramadan prayers called \"Taraweeh\" are held and 1/30 of the Quran is recited to ensure the full text is read by the end of the holiday. With charity being an element of the holiday, mosques often hold fundraisers or food drives during Ramadan, and even invite community members from other faiths inside to enjoy iftar.\n\nDuring Eid al-Fitr, it is a tradition for children to receive money, gifts or new clothes from loved ones.\n\nThe first day of the celebration begins with a special prayer and sermon in the morning, followed by a celebration with the community filled with food and games. Families also visit the graves of relatives, according to Britannica.\n\nHow to greet someone during Ramadan\n\nThere are many ways to greet someone during Ramadan or express you well wishes for the holiday.\n\n“Ramadan Mubarak” means “blessed Ramadan” and can be said to those observing the holiday, according to Almanac.\n\nSimilarly, “Eid Mubarak” means “blessed holiday,” and can be used to greet someone on during Eid al-Fitr, according to ING.\n\nOther ways to greet someone during Ramadan, according to Parade, include:\n\n“Sending wishes for a peaceful Ramadan.”\n\n“Wishing you a happy Ramadan.”\n\n“May Ramadan bring you prosperity and joy.”\n\n“Sending love to you and your family this Ramadan.”\n\n“May all your prayers be answered this Ramadan and always.”\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Their meeting was a fluke: Diane had tried a few other dating sites, including CatholicMatch, with no luck, but she reactivated her account on a whim.\n\nWithin the hour, she received a message from Nik.\n\nIt was a long-distance relationship at the start — he was a sports broadcaster for West Point Military Academy, a nearly three-hour drive from Johnson City, where she was deputy clerk.\n\nA month after meeting online, Diane came down for a visit. She sat through a 15-3 baseball game while Nik worked and it was in that moment Nik says God decided their future.\n\n\"Suddenly God made the decision for me. He said, 'Pick Diane.'\"\n\nWhen the hockey season started, she met him on weekends for games whether they were in West Point or elsewhere across the state. In the summer, Nik volunteered during all four days of Johnson City Field Days.\n\nSpeaking for an article posted on CatholicMatch.com, Diane spoke of Nik's dedication, and calling the Field Days \"her baby.\"\n\n\"He did not hesitate to jump right in and hep wherever he could,\" she said.\n\nThey were married Dec. 19, 2015, at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Binghamton, a young parish Diane helped build from three closed First Ward churches: St. Ann's, St. Joseph's and St. Stanislaus Kostka.\n\n\"No one can ignore the work Diane did with her church,\" Nik said. \"It was the leadership she showed during a time of transition that drew me to her, and that leadership rubbed off on other people.\"\n\nBuilding her church\n\nMarie Lukasik met Diane for the first time when the three churches merged in 2003, ushering strong Slovak, Lithuanian and Polish backgrounds into the same worship space.\n\nMarie and Diane were on the Liturgy and Worship committee formed to design that space at the site of the former St. Ann's on Prospect Street.\n\n\"She was always looking for creative ways to make our worship space warm, inviting and in tune with the liturgical seasons of the church,\" Marie said.\n\nNever, perhaps, was that more evident than during the Christmas season — Nik said no one loved Christmas more than Diane — when a large, 12-foot tree, called the Unity Tree, was set up in the church's gathering area. Instead of having the tree decorated, the committee invited all parishioners to add their own ornaments, representative of their families and ethnicity.\n\nOn their wedding day, held just before Christmas, Nik and Diane took several pictures near the tree.\n\nA year after the tree tradition began in 2004, in an article published in the Catholic Sun, Diane looked back on it.\n\n\"I think that's when it finally, truly jelled,\" she said at the time. \"It was a moving time for everybody.\"\n\nDiane's passion for her Catholic faith and her new parish demonstrated itself in many ways. She helped prepare a history of St. Ann's parish before the merger, Marie said, and after, she worked to do the same to chronicle the other formerly separate parishes.\n\nShe taught religious education for many years, helped prepare children to receive Holy Communion and served as parish council president.\n\n\"(She) helped our new parish grow and thrive,\" Marie said.\n\n'We can handle it'\n\nDiane's involvement in the Johnson City Field Days was similar. For the core group of organizers — only a handful of people — behind the four-day event, Diane's role was essential.\n\nFormer Johnson City mayor Harry Lewis, who is also on the Johnson City Celebration Committee, said Diane somehow managed to do the work of two people in planning the festival.\n\nAfter a full day's work for the village, Diane would go home and start working on Field Days planning. She retrieved all the necessary permits and approvals, lined up entertainment acts and coordinated with the participating vendors and organizations.\n\nIt was a job in which Lewis said she had to be able to multi-task, jumping back and forth between different projects but still remembering where she'd left off.\n\n\"It's a monumental task and she handled it with ease,\" he said. \"She put her whole heart and soul into that.\"\n\nShe did so with an infectious smile, Lewis said, and a personable attitude that made her easy to work with, no matter how stressful the situation. Even if something didn't look like it was going to turn out well, Diane had a way of easing the tension.\n\n\"She'd give you a little grin and say, 'We can handle it,'\" Lewis said.\n\nThis year, when Labor Day rolls around, Northside Park in Johnson City is expected to once again fill with families attending the Johnson City Field Days, an event Diane called \"a wonderful hometown celebration to celebrate our community and celebrate the end of summer,\" in a 2015 article published in the Press & Sun-Bulletin.\n\nWhile Nik says his wife \"never did anything for validation,\" her legacy lives in the young parish and the 51-year-old festival she helped to thrive.\n\nDiane (Salva) Busko is survived by her husband, Nikolai Busko; mother, Virginia Salva; brother, Steve Salva; sister, Joanne Salva; grandmother, Arlene Karaim; aunt and uncle, Tom & Bernice Salva; and several cousins.\n\nMore:Johnson City woman, 74, was 'the example of what people should be'\n\nMore:Joe Giordani, 68, of Binghamton, 'marched to his own drum'\n\nMore:JC woman, 97, was faith-filled mother of 7 with 'terrific sense of humor'\n\nIn A Life Lived, we honor the lives of those who've recently passed away in our communities.

A hell scape at Splendour,” he said.\n\nOthers called for the festival to be canceled in the interest of public safety. “I’m honestly of the opinion that if you put the safety of both staff and attendees first, then you should cancel,” said one Facebook user.\n\nBut the organizers vowed the show could would continue on Saturday and Sunday. “Please be assured that our event team is working very hard to provide the best experience possible under the current circumstances,” they said in a statement.\n\n“We look forward to Saturday and Sunday programming moving ahead as planned.”\n\nAs much of the world has sweltered during summer heatwaves, Australia has experienced a particularly wet winter, punctuated by flooding along the eastern coast.\n\nExperts the climate crisis had increased the frequency and intensity of the La Nina weather system, generating above average rainfall.\n\nDevastating floods hit New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, earlier this month, damaging homes still waiting repairs from the previous floods and forcing businesses to shutter.", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/01/georgia-covid-19-rules-kentucky-derby-5-things-know-weekend/7352611002/", "title": "Georgia COVID-19 rules, Kentucky Derby: 5 things to know this ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nGeorgia Gov.

A result of a cooperative partnership by the city of Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Department of Transportation, PPL Montana and the volunteer trail advocacy group, Recreational Trails Inc., it is one of the urban delights of Great Falls that blends the city with its rural surroundings. Some of its \"splashy features include Black Eagle Falls, Rainbow Falls, Crooked Falls, Ryan Falls (the \"great falls of the Missouri\") and Morony Falls, outdoor art and memorial benches and tables and picnic shelters.\n\nIn 1990, Recreational Trails Inc. formed to help forge the riverside route, which grows each year with new places and trails to explore. The paved, wheelchair-accessible trail runs along the south shore of the river, from Oddfellows Park, which is near the Warden Bridge on 10th Avenue South, past Broadwater Bay, Mitchell Pool, Gibson and Elks Riverside Parks, Black Eagle Falls, the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, Giant Springs Heritage State Park and Rainbow Falls to the Crooked Falls Overlook. The asphalt ends there, but the trail doesn't. A dirt trail stretches along the cliffs another three miles to Cochrane Dam.\n\nEast of Great Falls, the North Shore Trail follows along Cochrane, Ryan and Morony reservoirs. The trail begins at the end of Rainbow Dam Road and includes gravel and single track segments totaling more than 13 miles. A single-track trail now runs between Rainbow and Morony dams, and a trailhead has been established at Rainbow Dam. An expert single-track trail between Ryan and Cochrane dams provides an exceptional way to explore the river canyon east of town. Interpretive signs describing the ecology of the area have been provided by the Cascade Conservation District and the Missouri River Council, and QR Code signs along the trail make information about the trail and dams available to smartphone users.\n\nThe Montana Department of Transportation has completed the design of the Sun River Connector Trail to extend a separated bike and pedestrian connection along Country Club Blvd., between the west approach of the Warden Bridge and 6th Street Southwest, and construction will begin in 2016. This summer's improvements will include a paved loop from Heritage Park down to Giant Springs, a new trail between the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center and Giant Springs and the opening of a 2.1-mile loop linking the Heritage Center, Giant Springs and Heritage Park. Paving will be done to the parking area at Bay Drive, and United Materials will be redoing the shoulders along the trail from 15th Street to Giant Springs.\n\nSummer 2015 activities include Audubon West Wednesday Walks for bird watching along the river and on Sacajawea Island, Cochrane Dam crossings on July 11 and Aug. 22 and a number of \"fun runs\" and mountain bike activities. For details call 788-3313 or read more about the trails at www.thetrail.org.\n\n2 The C.M. Russell Museum\n\nVisitors from all over the world enjoy the Great Falls museum named after the famous cowboy artist who adopted Great Falls as his home more than a century ago. They also can enjoy the Russell Rider Sculpture Garden, a place \"families can come, free of charge, all four seasons\" to picnic, roam the garden and appreciate wonderful art including five major bronze pieces. Five galleries have been installed to showcase the \"astonishing depth and range\" of Russell's art, which ranged from paintings and sculpture to illustrated letters and pen-and-ink drawings during his lifetime (1864-1926). The museum has some 2,000 Russell artworks, personal objects and a \"permanent collection of more than 12,000 objects\" including works of such well-known artists as O.C. Seltzer, Winold Reiss, J.H. Sharp and Frank Tenney Johnson.\n\nDon't miss \"The Bison: American Icon, Heart of the Plains Indian Culture,\" the most ambitious permanent exhibition ever displayed at the C.M. Russell Museum. With about 500 artifacts and a thundering buffalo diorama that shakes as you walk over it, the $1.5 million exhibition is a fitting subject because three-quarters of the Russell Museum's entire collection of paintings and sculpture involve Indians and bison. The \"Browning Firearms Collection\" of rifles, shotguns and handguns surveys the significant developments made by the Browning, Winchester and Colt companies. New this season is \"Harmless Hunter: The Wildlife Work of Charles M. Russell,\" runs through Sept. 13, and \"focuses for the first time on Russell's painting of wildlife.\"\n\nRight beside the museum is Russell's Log Studio, built in 1903. The artifacts in it belonged to Russell and were used for reference in his artwork. The Russell home next door was built in 1900 under the supervision of his wife, Nancy. During the summer, the museum, located at 400 13th St. N., is open Tuesday to Sunday. Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the cabin studio is open 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and the home is open 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Admission is $9 for adults, $7 for seniors, retired military and schedule tour groups, $4 for students and is free for active military and kids under age 5. Call 727-8787, or visit www.cmrussell.org.\n\n3 Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center is nestled into the bluffs of the Missouri River overlooking a section of river where the famed explorers portaged two centuries ago to avoid the nearby waterfalls. Black Eagle Falls, the uppermost of the five falls, is visible from the big windows of the interpretive center. Outside, four pedestrian trails connect the interpretive center with Giant Springs Heritage State Park, and a bicycle-pedestrian trail connects the interpretive center with the River's Edge Trail via a tunnel beneath Giant Springs Road.\n\nInside the center, the exhibits are educational and interactive. The ground floor includes the ornate Compass Rose, with a list of private contributors who helped finance the original construction. Only half of the construction cost was funded with federal money. Pictographs tell the explorers' story in Indian drawings. Grabbing the most attention as visitors enter the center is a striking life-size diorama of buckskin-clad explorers hefting a 30-foot canoe up a ravine in their portage around the falls. The exhibit stretches two stories and is framed by vast windows overlooking the Missouri.\n\nThe center \"imparts to the public a personal sense of President Thomas Jefferson's vision of expanding America to the west; it inspires awe and awakens curiosity toward the challenges faced by the expedition as they portaged the great falls of the Missouri river and explored the 'unknown'; brings to life the daily experiences of the expedition and the environment and native peoples of the 'uncharted West'; and celebrated the indomitable spirit of human discovery we all share,\" according to the center's mission statement.\n\nThe 26th Annual Lewis and Clark Festival is taking place June 19-21 and promises to deliver participants \"back to ways of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and life out on the open frontier of the West.\" This special event includes historical programs, children's activities, Native American cultural programs, artisans and local craftspeople and a variety of local food vendors.\n\nOn Fridays beginning June 26, \"Riverside Voices,\" staff of the center and guest presenters, offer evening programs in the amphitheater on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River or in the indoor theater. Topics include medicine on the expedition, the boats used in the journey, changes in the river since the exploration and more Lewis and Clark history and related subjects. A \"Star Party Extravaganza\" for learning about our night sky with the Central Montana Astronomy Society, is Sept. 25 in the center's parking lot.\n\nSummer hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily. Costs are $8 for adults and free for those 15 and younger. Federal Interagency Annual, Senior, Military and Access Passes are honored for free entry.\n\nContact Information: 4201 Giant Springs Road, Great Falls, MT 59405. Phone: 406-727-8733.\n\n4 Alive @ Five\n\nIf you enjoy live music, street dancing and great food, friends and fun, plan to attend Alive @ 5, a \"big city experience in the heart of Great Falls.\" Every Thursday from June 11 through Aug. 6 (except for July 30), one designated area of downtown comes alive with \"the finest street music tradition\" of food vendors, liquid refreshments, live music and activities for children. The June 18 date was reserved for \"Taste of Great Falls,\" a sampling of fare from local restaurants, and Aug. 6 also will be a fundraiser for Roberts Park. The events are held from 5 to 9 p.m. Call 406-453-6151 or visit downtowngreatfalls.net for more information.\n\n5 Giant Springs State Park\n\nFirst documented by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805, Giant Springs is one of the largest freshwater springs in the world. This is also the site of the Roe River, once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's shortest river. Giant Springs flows at a measured 7.9 million gallons per hour or 156 million gallons of water per day. The water stays at a temperature of 54 degrees and has been carbon dated to be about 3,000 years old. More than a quarter of a million lovers of nature visit Giant Springs Heritage Park each year. Many come to marvel at this remarkable feature, or to view the 80-plus species of birds, mammals and reptiles. On any day you may find bicyclists, fishing enthusiasts, photographers and many others; some come to visit the nearby Rainbow Falls Overlook, the visitor center and the fish hatchery.\n\nThe fish hatchery program raises from 700,000 to 800,000 fish annually. They are then distributed to areas in central Montana from the Canadian border to the Wyoming border. A group picnic site is also available. The Fish, Wildlife and Parks visitor center (right across from the roadway from the springs) features taxidermy mounts of grizzly and black bears, educational features on fish and bird recognition, wildlife photographs, and a mini-theater that shows wildlife videos. Pets on leash are welcome.\n\nEvents at the park include ranger talks dealing with the wildlife of the area, bird strolls and kids activities.

He demanded parks, and that's what we got. His namesake is the centerpiece of the park system. Located at Park Drive and 1st Avenue North, Gibson Park features a duck pond, flower gardens, a walking path, basketball courts, restrooms and a playground. Summertime concerts take place at an outdoor band shell. A pedestrian underpass from Gibson Park takes you to Elks Riverside Park, a lesser-known but huge park along the river that features tennis courts, horseshoe pits, a skate park, playground equipment and large expanses of grass where you can fly a kite, play catch or simply relax.\n\nAny sunny day, you'll also find people picnicking, playing games or simply lounging in the rest of the city's 400 acres developed into 57 parks. Two dozen usable public tennis courts also are scattered around the city. A complex of eight courts is available for public use at C.M. Russell High School. In addition, there are three on River Drive North near the 6th Street underpass; four at Montana Park; two each at Lions, West Kiwanis and Jaycee parks; and one each at Sunrise, Charles Russell and North Kiwanis parks. Call Parks and Recreation Administration at 771-1265 for more information.\n\n14 Pacific Steel and Recycling Trailside Dog Park\n\nAn attractively fenced and landscaped area where dogs can \"run free and play 'off leash' with their canine and human friends,\" the dog park, located at 800 River Drive North alongside River's Edge Trail, was opened July 15, 2009. The park was built for less than $100,000 and was financed by gifts to the Animal Foundation of Great Falls, which donated the park to the city of Great Falls. The park features a small pavilion in the middle and separate fenced and landscaped areas equipped for small and large dogs. The dividing line for dog size is 25 pounds. A paved path in the large-dog park was recently installed to protect the turf, and agility equipment on both sides of the park allows for better exercise.\n\nDog owners will find there is no charge to use the park, but they are still responsible for proper pet etiquette and obeying the rules of the Dog Park. Disposal bags and garbage cans are readily available, but drinking fountains for both humans and dogs are rather temperamental, so it's wise to bring your own water. The park is open from dawn to dusk, but it may be closed on occasion for maintenance or improvements. Watch the Tribune for announcements or call the Park and Recreation office at 771-1265. For more information, visit the foundation's website at www.theanimalfoundation.com.\n\n15 First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park\n\nFormerly called \"Ulm Pishkun,\" it is believed to be the largest prehistoric bison kill site in North America and has now been nominated to be designated a National Historic Landmark. The site, at 342 Ulm-Vaughn Road, consists of a mile-long sandstone cliff, remnants of drive lines and up to 18 feet of compacted buffalo remains as well as \"expansive panoramic views\" of the Rocky Mountain Front, the Missouri River valley and characteristic buttes and grasslands of the High Plains.

Admission is free for state residents or $6 per vehicle for out-of-state visitors. Call 866-2217 for more information.\n\n16 Farmers Market\n\nNo longer just about the abundance of vegetables sold here, the Great Falls Farmers Market is held on Saturdays beginning June 6 through Sept. 26, from 7:45 a.m. to noon, in the Civic Center's Whittier Park. As the popularity of the market has grown, so has the number of vendors, so much that the market has expanded from Civic Center Park onto Park Drive and into the parking lot across the street, and a Wednesday market has been added to the schedule from July 18 to Sept. 23, 4:30-6:30 p.m. More than 100 vendors are expected to bring unique hand-crafted items of all kinds, baked goods, jams, jellies, syrups and all kinds of ready-to-eat foods.

Eagle Falls, adjacent to Legion Park at 25th Street and River Drive North, and Anaconda Hills, a short, hilly course in Black Eagle on the north side of the Missouri River, 2400 Smelter Ave. Both courses offer driving ranges as well as full pro shops and concessions. Other courses include Hickory Swing, a public course at 1100 American Ave., and Meadow Lark Country Club at the confluence of the Sun and Missouri rivers at 300 Country Club Blvd.\n\nEagle Falls Golf Club is an 18-hole course open to the public. Opened in 1953, it underwent a major re-design in 1999 and now plays from 5,234 to 6,571 yards as a par 71. Four sets of tees make it inviting for the casual player and extremely challenging for the avid golfer. There is also a newly designed chipping green, a putting green, practice bunker and a limited driving range. Reserve tee times two days in advance by calling 761-1078.\n\nAnaconda Hills Golf Course is also a city-run course opened originally in the 1920s as a nine-hole course for the employees of the Anaconda Copper Co. The city acquired the course in the 1970s, and nine new holes and grass greens were added in 1992. Hilly and tree-lined with natural rough and water, the par 69 course is slightly less than 5,700 yards. Call 761-8459.\n\nFounded in 1919, the private Meadow Lark Country Club is recognized as having one of the great classic designs with a reputation for sleek, undulating greens. The 18-hole championship course is considered one of the top 10 places to play in Montana. The club also includes a clubhouse, \"award-winning pro shop, formal dining room and more casual grill room, three indoor and four outdoor tennis courts and a swimming pool open Memorial Day to Labor Day. Call 453-6531.\n\nHickory Swing is an 18-hole par 60 executive golf course in west Great Falls. It plays 3,731 yards over 86 acres. It was built in 1992 as a course for all skill levels.

Open from February (weather permitting) through October, the course now opens at 6 a.m. for early-bird golfers. $20 for 18 holes, $12 for nine; call 452-9400 for available tee times.\n\n19 The Great Falls Dams\n\nThe beautiful waterfalls east of Great Falls now are mostly covered by a series of hydroelectric dams. But glimpses of the falls so famously journaled by Lewis and Clark remain, especially when water is running high on the Missouri. Visitors have several opportunities to view these dams. Perhaps the easiest is Black Eagle Dam, which can be seen close up on the River's Edge Trail or from an overlook on River Road. Just downstream, Rainbow Dam has also been offering beautiful views since 1910 and has undergone a construction project increasing its generating capacity by 70 percent. Between these two is Cochrane Dam, part of the Great Falls Portage National Landmark, which produces 64 megawatts of electricity. Ryan Dam, the original \"great falls of the Missouri,\" is an especially fun destination. A suspension foot bridge leads to an island from which visitors can climb to an observation point and get a full-on view of the dam. The island has a picnic and cooking area very popular with families. Morony Dam is 15 miles northeast of Great Falls. It's classified as a \"run-of-river\" project because it can generate electricity using the water that flows down the river without need to store additional supplies. Boaters, hikers and fishermen should call 454-5840 for current trailhead, boat launch and parking closures.\n\n20 Black Eagle Memorial Island\n\nBlack Eagle Memorial Island opened to the public for the first time in 2005. Located just below Black Eagle Falls, the man-made island was created from material dredged out of the tailrace below the Black Eagle Dam's generation station. In the past, it was used as a parking lot for smelter workers at the former Anaconda Mining Co. complex. Today the area features a restored truss bridge, exceptional stone walls, a launch for non-motorized boats and an interpretive viewing plaza below the falls. The area is open for hiking, biking, kayaking, canoeing and fishing and is part of the new River's Edge Trail section that links West Bank Park to the island.\n\n21 Missouri River Breaks National Monument\n\nOn a topographical map of Montana, the Missouri River Breaks look like a crumpled brown grocery bag extending west to east along the Missouri River from Fort Benton to Fort Peck. The Arrow Creek Breaks and the Musselshell Breaks contribute to the larger geographic area from the south. The Breaks, located in northcentral Montana, offer some of the finest recreational opportunities in the entire state, from river floating to hiking to hunting to horseback riding.\n\nOn the ground, the Breaks consist of rough ridges separated by steep — sometimes almost vertical — coulees. The vegetation consists of scattered Ponderosa pine, juniper, Douglas fir and mixed grasses growing in a shale/gumbo soil type. While not the most hospitable region for humans, the Breaks provide suitable habitat for an impressive list of wildlife species.\n\nThe Breaks mean different things to different people. It is defined, in part, by the history of Lewis and Clark, as a sanctuary for desperados staying a step ahead of the law and as a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders. Some enjoy the remote area mostly for the solitude and recreational opportunities provided by the Upper Missouri River, Fort Peck Reservoir and a mixture of public and private lands. Others see the Breaks as a source of grass for livestock, natural gas, timber products and other vital pieces of our economic puzzle.\n\nIn 2001, a portion of the public land in the Breaks managed by the Bureau of Land Management, roughly 375,000 acres, was designated as the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.\n\nU.S. Highway 87 accesses the western portion of the monument at Fort Benton. On the eastern edge, U.S. Highway 101 crosses the monument and the Missouri at the James Kipp Recreation Area, and Montana Highway 236 also provides access through Lewistown, Winifred and Big Sandy.\n\nThere are no motels, service stations or restaurants in the interior of the Monument. The Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center in Fort Benton is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday Call 622-4000.\n\n22 Monarch and Neihart\n\nAn hour's drive from Great Falls, these neighboring mountain towns are located in a historic mining district. The mines are closed, but the surrounding mountains are open to fun. Local creeks offer excellent fishing. There are scores of trails and backcountry roads to explore on foot, mountain bike or all-terrain vehicle. Check at trailheads for info on motorized access. Check out the easy, half-mile hike to popular Memorial Falls. Camping is available in some areas. The wildlife viewing is terrific. And winter offers a wide range of activities, including snowmobiling, downhill skiing, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.\n\n23 Sluice Boxes State Park\n\nJust south of Belt, where Belt Creek slices out of the Little Belt Mountains is an area of soaring limestone cliffs and precipitous ledges, the Belt Creek Canyon and Sluice Boxes State Park. Rich in history and geologic features, the park provides excellent hiking and viewing of abundant wildlife in a wide range of habitats from shaded rock walls and miniature waterfalls to open, sun-baked slopes covered in prairie grasses. Enjoying the park, however, is not for the faint of heart. Because the train bridges were removed, hikers must ford the creek. That's nearly impossible during high water, so hiking in the Sluice Boxes is limited to the low-water season — usually mid-July through September. The creek is spring-fed and cold. Backcountry camping is allowed with permit year-round. The only facilities are the parking lot, vault toilet and the trail which follows an abandoned rail grade. Call 454-5840 or visit stateparksmt.gov/sluice-boxes.\n\n24 Fort Benton's Riverfront\n\nThe historic community of Fort Benton, 42 miles north of Great Falls, boasts a stunning setting on the banks of the Missouri River. The site of a pre-Civil War trading post and key economic point during the \"steamboat era,\" the town is the water gateway to the Missouri Breaks National Monument and a popular launch site for rafts and canoes. Reconstruction of three buildings of the fort is taking place; the Northeast Bastion and Blockhouse are now historically accurate. A heroic-sized statue of explorers Lewis and Clark overlooks the river along a scenic walking path. Another statue immortalizes Shep, a legendarily faithful dog. A walking bridge spans the river and offers benches for rest and reflection. There's lots to do elsewhere in town, which has two museums and a historic restored hotel, the Grand Union, which boasts a fine restaurant. From June 26 to 28, visitors may experience Montana's premier small town festival. In celebration of Chouteau County's 150th birth, the theme this year is \"Footsteps Through Time.\" Call 750-2918.\n\n25 Havre Beneath the Streets\n\nThe Historical Underground Tour is a recreation of Havre's history. When fire destroyed most of Havre, business owners moved underground to carry on their business until the town could be rebuilt. Step back in time as much as 100 years, into the Sporting Eagle Saloon, a turn-of-the-century honky-tonk where cowboys gambled, kicked up their heels and drank good old-fashioned frontier rot-gut. Saunter along the streets beneath Havre and see an opium den (one of three known to have existed in the early days), a Chinese laundry, an ethnic restaurant, and, of course, a bordello.\n\nTours are available during summer months Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with the last tour beginning at 3:30 p.m. Reservations are recommended; the ticket office is at 120 3rd Ave., south of Norman's Ranch Wear.

Take a one-hour walking tour for a close-up look at the best-preserved bison kill and campsite in this area of the plains. The Brick Mural is now complete in the shadow of the Bear Paw Mountains.

Open June 1 to Labor Day from 9 a.m. to 4.p.m. Tours are usually available \"on demand.\" Call 265-6417 or visit www.buffalojump.org for more information.\n\n27 Fort Assiniboine Historic Site\n\nFort Assiniboine Historic Site, located 6 miles southwest of Havre on Highway 87, was constructed in 1879, and became the largest military fort west of the Mississippi River. The post had 104 buildings and was contained within a 40-mile-long by 15-mile-wide military reservation. Several of the original buildings still stand. It became a state agricultural experiment station in 1911 and is now the home of Montana State University's Northern Agricultural Research Center. The primary mission of the fort's garrison was to prevent attacks from the some 5,000 Lakota Sioux Indians led by Sitting Bull, and other chiefs who had fled to the safety of Canada after the Battle of the Little Big Horn.\n\nThe fort served as a base for patrols along the Canadian border and the Milk River Valley. Fort Assiniboine became the state's military headquarters, with the responsibility of maintaining control over the Blackfoot Confederacy and other northern Montana Indian reservations. The most famous soldier to serve at the fort was John J. Pershing, who was assigned to the post in 1896. He commanded H Troop, the black \"Buffalo Soldiers\" of the 10th Cavalry. The Fort Assiniboine Preservation Society offers summer tours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mon.-Fri., and by appointment for the weekends.

The flight of the Nez Perce, led by Chief Joseph from Army soldiers, took them from Oregon, through Idaho, into Montana and almost to the Canadian border before they were defeated. Here the tribe split up, with some heading to Canada and others to Nebraska. The Nez Perce ceased fighting at Bear Paw on Oct. 5, 1877, and Chief Joseph gave his immortal speech, \"From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\" The battlefield is open daily year-round during daylight hours but closed for lunch from noon to 1 p.m. Visitors may walk a self-guided 1.25-mile interpretive trail of moderate difficulty and are encouraged to visit the Blaine County Museum at 501 Indiana St. in Chinook and see the audio/visual presentation \"40 Miles to Freedom\" before touring the battlefield.

Mountain ranges surround three sides, forming a backdrop to a scene that reminds visitors of the days when the entire prairie-wetland ecosystem was alive with thousands of different birds. Benton Lake was created thousands of years ago by the continental glacier, and the area was excluded from homesteading in 1885 in order to provide an irrigation district. Animals abound in the refuge and include water birds such as ducks, Canada geese, snow geese and tundra swans. Also common are sightings of dozens of species of mammals, including mountain cottontail, American badger, striped skunk and long-tailed weasel. Ten numbered signs along the Wildlife Auto Tour correspond to a map provided at the information kiosk at the beginning of the drive, helping visitors reflect on species, habitat, history and management of Benton Lake NWR.

In 2006, they received state funding for the creation of the museum. Opened in 2008, the 3,000-square-foot Great Plains Dinosaur Museum showcases a \"stunning variety\" of real fossils of fish, squids, lobsters and rare crabs, plants and some of Montana's best-preserved dinosaurs, including Triceratops, Stegasaurus, Sauropod, raptor Dromesaurus and Handrosaurus.

Visitors interested in their turn-of-the-century exploits can still check out several sites along the so-called Outlaw Trail. Start in Scobey, near the beginning of the trail, where Dutch Henry and his gang frequently hung out at the Dug Out Saloon. Much of the history is captured at the Daniels County Museum and Pioneer Town, where 35 historic buildings were restored to depict a town in the early part of the century. If you're in Scobey the last weekend in June, stop by for Pioneer Days, featuring the (family-friendly) Dirty Shame Show. Call 406-487-5965 to confirm dates.

Call Complex headquarters at 538-7521.\n\nGLACIER COUNTRY\n\n42 Blackfeet Indian Reservation\n\nWhile most of the members of Montana's largest Indian tribe, the Blackfeet, live much like mainstream Western society, they also have maintained traditions such as the use of painted tepees, colorful headdresses and deerskin costumes on special occasions. The Museum of the Plains Indian, near the intersection of U.S. Highways 2 and 89 in Browning, has a comprehensive collection of cultural artifacts and exhibits as well as a gift shop featuring a wide variety of Native American art and jewelry. Interpreter-guided tours, offering a deeper look at the history of the Blackfeet people, begin at the Museum of the Plains Indian and cover sites such as Sun Dance, Buffalo Jumps, Tepee Rings, Holy Family Mission and Fort McLeod Road. The museum is open Tuesday-Saturday, 9 a.m.-4:45 p.m., through Labor Day. Call 338-2230.

The Heart Butte Society Celebration will be held Aug. 6-9 at Heart Butte, a town 26 miles south of Browning.\n\n43 Glacier National Park\n\nThe breathtaking vistas of Glacier National Park draw visitors from all over the world. This 1-million-acre national park preserves some of America's most gorgeous country — including 106 miles of the Continental Divide — and the abundant wildlife that inhabits its wilderness.\n\nGlacier National Park has been revered by the Plains Indians for many generations. Archeologists have found evidence of human activity in the Glacier Park area that dates back 10,000 years. These early people may have been the ancestors of the Blackfeet, Salish and Kootenai Indians. Meriwether Lewis came close to the southern tip of Glacier in 1806, checking how far north the Missouri River watershed extended. White explorers kept searching for the perfect mountain pass through which to run a railroad line over the Rockies. Although many of the region's Native Americans knew the location of Marias Pass, the Blackfeet guarded it closely. In 1889, an explorer for the Great Northern Railway, John F. Stevens, finally figured out where Marias Pass lay. Marias was the lowest mountain pass between Canada and Mexico. Its low altitude and easy grade made it perfect for trains to cross the Continental Divide. The mountains east of the Continental Divide were acquired from the Blackfeet in 1895 and designated a national wilderness forest preserve in 1900, opening it to mining. President William Howard Taft signed the bill to establish Glacier as a national park in 1910.\n\nPortions of the Going-to-the-Sun Road remain open all year, but unpredictable spring snow storms can slow plowing progress. For current road status, visit home.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/hours.htm. Other roads open in May, weather permitting. The summer rate for a 7-day vehicle (non-commercial car, truck or van) permit is $25 with the 7-day single-entry price for visitors traveling by foot, bicycle, motorcycle or in a non-commercial organized group is set at $12. There is no entrance fee on Aug. 25 and Sept. 26.\n\nThere are 700 miles of hiking trails, and many visitors wouldn't miss a chance to hike along the Garden Wall. Campers have a choice of about 1,200 first-come, first-serve campsites accessible by vehicle, and permits are available for 13 country front campgrounds. The historic Many Glacier Hotel has recently undergone a $10 million renovation, but historic hotels book up fast; call Glacier Park Inc. at 892-2525 or Apgar Village Lodge at 888-5484.Tour buses and boats are available seasonally, and guided hiking trips and American Indian interpretive tours are also available. Many visitors also make arrangements to cross the border into Waterton Lakes National Park on the Canadian side of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.\n\n44 Izaak Walton Inn\n\nLocated just off Highway 2 at Essex, on the southern tip of Glacier National Park, is the picturesque Izaak Walton Inn. It was built in 1939 for train crews on the Great Northern Railway. Today it's a popular inn, restaurant and mini railroad museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The dining room walls are covered with old photographs and prints of trains. \"Relaxation is key,\" and \"room telephones are absent\" in the inn. For a different experience, rent one of the four old cabooses that have been converted into overnight lodging or stay in one of six new family cabins. Additional lodging is now available in the GN 441 Luxury Locomotive which features 44-year-old reclaimed oak floors and a full kitchen, and the JJ Caboose, named for James Jerome Hill, the Empire Builder of the Great Northern Railway, for an unsurpassed cozy western retreat. The trains still run past the inn, with passenger service available. And Essex is a great place from which to find a trailhead into the surrounding mountains. You may also book Glacier interpretive Red Bus tours or whitewater raft trips from the inn. For information or reservations, call 406-888-5700 or visit www.izaakwaltoninn.com.\n\n45 Flathead Valley\n\nIn the northwest corner of Montana lies the picturesque Flathead Valley.

From hiking, fishing, boating and golfing in the summer to cross-country or downhill skiing in the winter, the only thing visitors will wish for more of is time. Flathead Lake is the largest natural freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River, and the resort town, Bigfork, situated at its north shore, is a picturesque town with a 27-hole golf course, Eagle Bend Golf Club (837-7310). Family fun abounds in the area, with the Big Sky Water Park in Columbia Falls (892-5025) and numerous fresh huckleberry and Flathead cherry stands scattered throughout the valley.

Call the Flathead Convention and Visitors Bureau at 800-543-3105.\n\n46 Saint Ignatius Mission\n\nBuilt in 1854 by Native Americans under the supervision of Catholic missionaries who came to convert the locals, the Mission's setting is beautiful, with the Mission Mountains in the background. The striking building features 61 original murals along its walls and on its ceiling. These are by Joseph Carignano, a Jesuit priest who served at the mission. The mission is open for private worship 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the summer with Sunday Mass at 9:15 a.m. Reservations are not accepted, but walk-ins are welcome. Gift shop on site.

New restrictions exclude longer vehicles as well as any trailer or towed vehicle. Visitors' Center is open daily 10 a.m.-2 p.m., but the front gate is open 6:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.\n\n48 Whitefish Mountain Resort\n\nOpening day is June 20! Located on the edge of Whitefish and just west of Glacier Park, Whitefish Mountain Resort is a world-class downhill ski destination. It offers lodging, restaurants, lots of activities and some of the best views in the area. That goes for summer, too. Take the 15-minute gondola ride to the top of the mountain and witness stunning vistas of Glacier Park and the surrounding area. Have lunch, and then hop the gondola for the trip down. Better yet, take the scenic walking trail.

During spring and early summer tremendous viewing opportunities abound in the Yaak River area as snowmelt follows its way down and over the falls. For any photographer, this is one sight that shouldn't be missed. This site can be found on a Kootenai National Forest Visitors Map at Township 33N, Range 33W, Section 9. The Yaak Falls, named after the Yaak Indians who once populated this remote area of Montana, has always been a favorite stop on the scenic tour of northwest Montana. This beautifully cascading waterfall was created by the eastward shift of the Pacific plate. As a result of this shifting, some of the oldest rock in the world is exposed. The rock is dated between 800 million and 11/2 billion years old. This area is rich in local history, dating back to the 1880s. Part of an old bridge can be seen just below the falls. This bridge was the first structure to span the Yaak River. This allowed unrestricted passage from Troy to another important mining town called Sylvanite. Many placer mining camps, including one called \"Snipe Town,\" operated near the falls in the 1890s. In 1910, a devastating fire destroyed mining operations around the falls area. The Yaak Falls Campground is a little pack-in, pack-out campground with a maximum stay of 14 days and no fees. No toilets or drinking water are available. Call 295-4693.\n\n51 Hot Springs\n\nHot Springs, founded in 1910, is named for the local hot mineral springs that still bubble today.

Opportunities for privacy, quietness, and relaxation abound in this area. Many lakes, streams and rivers provide excellent fishing for the avid fisherman. Nearby sight-seeing attractions include a tour of the National Bison Range at Moiese, a visit to the historical St. Ignatius Mission Church and Flathead Lake with its many opportunities for boating, jet skiing, water skiing and fishing.\n\n52 Seeley Lake\n\nNamed for the lake it abuts, Seeley Lake is a small town quickly growing in popularity with tourists. In winter, it's known for great snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, dog sledding and ice fishing. Summer recreation is even more plentiful. The lake itself offers camping, boating, swimming and fishing. Nearby trails head off into both the Bob Marshall and Mission Mountain wilderness areas. Folks on mountain bikes and all-terrain vehicles love all the old logging roads. The Clearwater River, which runs south through the valley, and the Swan River which flows north, offer fishing and canoeing. Golfers enjoy the nine-hole mountain course and more at Double Arrow Resort on the south edge of town. Call the Seeley Lake Area Chamber of Commerce at 677-2880.\n\nSeveral guest ranches offer horseback riding. There's camping and boating also available at nearby Swan Lake and Placid Lake. Just a short drive from Seeley Lake is the trailhead to Morrell Falls. A fairly flat, 2.5-mile hike leads to a stunning drop of falls — and a great place for a picnic. The hike is popular with families because children often enjoy splashing in Morrell Creek below the falls. Bring drinking water.\n\n53 The Sweet Palace\n\nIndulge your sweet tooth at the Sweet Palace at 109 E. Broadway in Philipsburg, and view what nostalgic, sumptuous sweets are cooking.

In 1991, cabinet builder Chuck Kaparich told city residents that if they'd provide a home for it, he'd build the carousel. When it opened four years later, more than 100,000 volunteer hours were logged on the project. Locals volunteered time and materials. The result: 38 hand-carved ponies, two chariots, 14 gargoyles and the largest band organ in continuous use in the country. A carving organization in Calgary, Alberta, even carved a friendship horse for the project. It's all contained within a building that looks like a jewel box. Dragons Hollow, the play area for children was added next to the carousel in 1995. Hours are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. June-August. Call 549-8382.\n\n55 Historical Museum at Fort Missoula\n\nCommunity members joined together in 1974 to save what was left of the historic 1877 Fort Missoula which had housed the black 25th Infantry in 1888 and served as a military training center during World War I, regional headquarters of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and as an alien detention center in 1941.

The M-hike is an ideal family activity, but the more ambitious hiker may consider tackling Sentinel itself. Reaching the summit is a bit more strenuous than the M, with an elevation gain of almost 2,000 feet in about one mile. From the summit, hikers have several options to extend their hike or descend the same way they came up. Mt. Jumbo, Mt. Sentinel's sister peak, branded with an L for Loyola High School, offers a climb of barely a mile, but there are fewer switchbacks to help with the climb.\n\n57 Alberton Gorge\n\nSome 30 miles west of Missoula on the Clark Fork River is the Alberton Gorge, the area's premier whitewater run for rafting and kayaking. It features Class III water, as well as quiet pools for swimming and fishing. Floaters are treated to many varieties of birds and wildlife, dramatic cliffs and roller-coaster rapids. Local companies offer full-day and half-day float trips. Only experienced floaters should hit the rapids without a guide.

In recent years archaeologists found evidence of the expedition's main cook fire and latrine, which confirmed the explorers had been there. Activities for visitors include bird watching, children's activities, educational programs and fly fishing. Open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. throughout the summer, the visitors' center opens at 9 a.m. The entrance is located ½ mile west of Lolo. Call 273-4253 or visit www.travelersrest.org.\n\n59 Garnet Ghost Town\n\n\"To walk the streets of this ghost town is to step back in time, free from intrusion of modern society!\"A former gold-mining camp east of Missoula, Garnet once boasted some 1,000 residents, a school, many businesses and 13 bars. But by 1912 the gold had played out and a raging fire sent most of the remaining residents packing. Today, Garnet is now considered the state's best-preserved ghost town. Garnet is open to tourists. Open year-round, but access is limited to snowmobile or cross-country skis in winter. For access instructions and restrictions, visit garnetghosttown.net or call 329-3914.\n\nGOLD WEST COUNTRY\n\n60 Virginia City\n\nVirginia City — and the nearby Nevada City — had their glory days during the 1860s gold rush. Seemingly frozen in time, much of their splendor is well preserved, and Virginia City now is a hot destination for history buffs and others seeking a window on the state's past. Virginia City is a National Historic Landmark, a very much alive ghost town that boasts a tremendous collection of old-west memorabilia. Many of the buildings are restored and now give visitors a real-life feel of the past. The Nevada City Living History Museum is open every summer.

It was the first territorial capital of Montana and became home to the infamous Sheriff Henry Plummer and the Vigilantes. Located about 25 miles south of Dillon on Grasshopper Creek, Bannack became a state park in 1954. Visitors can walk the boardwalk and enjoy the many buildings that have been preserved as part of this National Historic Landmark.

Guided and self-guided tours take visitors through the massive cell block that once housed the state's worst prisoners. Sandstone walls are 24 feet high and buried 4 feet deep to prevent escape by tunneling. A museum now adjoins the prison.

It was recently listed as one of the top 10 car museums in the country by USA Today.\n\n65 Old Works Golf Course\n\nAnaconda's history is built on copper smelting, but that history left a dirty legacy — a Superfund clean-up site. In the 1980s, the idea arose to transform the Old Works smelting site into something more useful. Today, the Old Works Golf Course is the state's only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course, and is quickly building a reputation as one of the premier daily-fee golf experiences in the Northwest region. It features multiple tees, allowing players of all levels to enjoy the challenging 18 holes. The course design includes some of the byproducts of the mining days. Huge piles of black slag are incorporated into the design. It's also used in the bunkers. Measuring up to 7,700 yards, the course runs along Warm Springs Creek. Fairways are bordered by native grasses planted as part of the restoration process. Nicklaus also designed the practice facility — putting area, chipping/bunker area, two bent-grass practice tees and three practice holes. Also available are a clubhouse, dining room and bar and pro shop. Call 563-5989 for prices and tee times.\n\n66 Big Hole National Battlefield\n\nThe site of a battle between the Nez Perce Indians and the 7th U.S. Infantry forces and civilian volunteers in 1877 as five bands of Nez Perce were fleeing the government's attempt to confine them on a small reservation in Idaho.

In 1955, copper mining in the area greatly expanded with the opening of the Berkeley Pit. By 1980, with more than 1.5 billion tons of material removed from the town's main mine, all that was left was the pit. The large, truck-operated, open-pit copper mine was world famous while in operation. Two small communities and much of Butte's former east side were swallowed up by the mine following land purchases for expansion. Now a superfund site, the pit is 7,000 feet long, 5,600 feet wide and 1,600 feet deep. It is slowly filling with water. Visitors can look at the colors of the pit from the viewing stand. Call 497-6250.\n\n68 Our Lady of the Rockies\n\nTowering 90 feet tall on the mountains overlooking Butte is Our Lady of the Rockies, a statue dedicated to all women, regardless of religion. Built entirely by volunteers, the statue was begun in 1979 and completed in 1985.

A guided boat tour from the marina provides visitors with an in-depth look at the area's geography, wildlife and history. The canyon is home to scores of creatures, including mountain sheep, deer, otters, turkey vultures and even the occasional black bear. Although the 2007 Meriwether fire scorched a large part of the area, vegetation is abundant. The canyon like waterway is actually home to some plants that can't be found anywhere else. Tour guides aboard the boats say the area is a \"geologist's playground.\" Passengers have the option to stop off at the Meriwether Picnic Area, stay awhile and catch a later boat back. There are restroom facilities, a large, covered picnic structure for group gatherings and smaller individual sites with grills and tables. Hikers can tackle the jaunt to the Mann Gulch, where a forest fire killed 13 smokejumpers in 1949, or the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness.

That simple act became a tremendous resource to ceramic artists, who now flock to the center from around the world. A prominent patron of the arts, Bray died in 1953, only two years after establishing the nonprofit Archie Bray Foundation. Since then, more than 400 artists have come to work and hone their talents at the Bray. It also sells pottery and sculpture. Tours are available.

Based on the second floor of an office building, it became Second Story Cinema and enjoyed a reputation for bringing in independent films. In 1985, with the help of a National Endowment for the Arts grant, the effort expanded with the renovation of the historic Lewis and Clark County Jail into an arts center. The Myrna Loy Center officially opened six years later. Its mission is to present challenging and enriching arts programs to the community.

Visitors may take a walking tour of the Drumlummon Hill which includes 14 sites, several of which are listed on the National Historic Register. The Catholic church and general store still serve the community and its visitors. The town now is a popular destination for sightseers and those just wanting a pleasant place for a picnic or a quiet day away from the bustle of town.\n\n77 Sun River Canyon\n\nFlowing from Gibson Reservoir, adjacent to the Bob Marshall Wilderness, is the Sun River.

The complex, designated as wilderness in 1964, is now considered one of the most completely preserved mountain ecosystems in the world. It includes rugged mountains ranges, alpine peaks, grassy meadows, fish-heavy streams, large valleys and huge forests. Because of its wilderness designation, the area is not open to motorized traffic. But hikers, backpackers and horse riders all enjoy their trips to the interior. The complex is home to grizzly bears, gray wolves, elk, deer, Canada lynx, bobcats, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bears, wolverines and other animals.

The country's first national park was established in 1872. Its 2.2 million acres cover a spectacular array of mountains, lakes, rivers and, of course, geysers, mud caldrons and bubbling hot pots.

Under the spiritual leadership of Sitting Bull, the Indians prepared for battle against the much stronger army. During the preparations, he was said to have conducted a Sun Dance and had a vision of a great victory of the white soldiers. The defeat of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and his 647 soldiers in the 7th Cavalry is now well known. Custer and his men attacked an Indian village in the valley of the Little Bighorn River. When the bloodshed ended, 263 cavalrymen — including Custer — lay dead.

Though the religion has more than 25 million adherents worldwide and a 100-plus-year history in the U.S, nearly two out of three Americans know \"little to nothing\" about the faith, according to a survey commissioned by Sikh leaders.\n\nMORE: Sikh gathering and march in Phoenix promotes tolerance, awareness\n\n\"We're just not on anyone's radar, which makes it really easy for people to have misconceptions about us,\" said Gurwin Singh Ahuja, co-founder of the National Sikh Campaign. \"When someone sees a Sikh man that has a turban and a beard — and there are a lot of Sikh men with turbans and a beard — many people associate that with religious extremism or terrorism.\n\n\"We have this huge dichotomy between how we're perceived and what our values actually are,\" Ahuja said.\n\nThe lack of familiarity with Sikhs and their faith has led to discrimination and hate crimes throughout the U.S., the worst of which left six dead at a Wisconsin temple in 2012.\n\nSikh leaders hope to reverse the trend with a $1.3 million awareness campaign on social media and major news networks Friday. The \"We are Sikhs\" spots will stress the faith's core tenets of equality, service and religious freedom, which Ahuja said mirror classic American values.\n\nThe non-profit National Sikh Campaign will conduct before-and-after polling in cities such as Phoenix and Fresno, California to measure changes in public perception of Sikhs, he said.\n\nPhoenix in particular has \"played an instrumental and important\" role in the Sikh-American narrative, Gumer said, because the first post-9/11 hate crime happened in Mesa. Mistaken for a Muslim, Balbir Singh Sodhi was gunned down outside his gas station by a man seeking revenge just days after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nOn April 9, about 200 of Phoenix's roughly 4,000 Sikhs gathered at Sodhi's relatives' restaurant, raising more than $115,000 to support the national campaign.\n\n\"I grew up in Texas with a father and brother who wore a turban, and now I'm married to a man who wears a turban, and the ignorance and bullying has been pretty constant,\" Gumer said. \"I just want my kids to be able to grow up in an environment where they're respected.\"\n\nRELATED: Phoenix police arrest suspect in murder of store clerk\n\nHere's a closer look at Sikhism, the world's fifth-largest organized religion.\n\nThe beginning\n\nSikhism, one of the youngest major religions, originated in northern India more than 500 years ago.\n\nSikhs believe in one god, with practices based on the teachings of Guru Nanak and his successors.\n\nJourney to the U.S.\n\nThe first Sikh immigrants to the U.S. — young men looking for work to support their families in India — arrived in the late 1800s. They primarily settled in California and Washington.\n\nFrom 1903-1908, thousands of Sikh workers helped lay hundreds of miles of roads and railways in northern California. Later, they turned to agriculture, at one point holding more than 80,000 acres of farmland.\n\nMore than half a million Sikhs live in the U.S. today. They work in all types of industries: A Sikh is recognized as the \"father of fiber optics,\" and another is the CEO of MasterCard.\n\nEmphasis on equality\n\nIndia's caste system, which dictated an individual's destiny based on class, was deeply entrenched at the time Sikhism began. Sikh leaders fought the system, believing everyone was equal in God's eyes.\n\nThey adopted the tradition of langar, or \"free kitchen,\" where hungry people from all castes could receive food and eat side by side. Langar was revolutionary at a time when the caste system divided the rich and poor in everyday activities.\n\nSikhs still prepare langar after services at gurdwaras, their places of worship, and the meals remain open to anyone in the community.\n\nProgressive gender roles\n\nThough gender equality has not been achieved universally among Sikhs, particularly in rural India, gender discrimination has no formal place in Sikhism. From the start, leaders promoted equal rights for men and women.\n\nSikhs gave all men the last name \"Singh\" and all women the last name \"Kaur\" to reduce inequality tied to castes and to give women an identity independent from their fathers or husbands. Today, Sikhs often keep their family surnames and use \"Singh\" and \"Kaur\" as middle names.\n\nReligious freedom\n\nFreedom of religion is an essential Sikh value. Teachings from leaders of other faiths appear alongside the words of Sikh gurus in the Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib.\n\nSikhs don't actively look to convert others, and they welcome people of any faith to their gurdwaras. When tens of thousands of Californians fled the threat of flooding in the Oroville area in February, Sikhs opened their temple doors to evacuees.\n\nOutward symbols\n\nThe turban, or dastaar, is the most common \"article of faith\" worn by Sikhs. Uncut hair, or kes, is usually wrapped underneath and shows respect for the perfection of God's creations.\n\nOther articles of faith include a steel wristband or bracelet symbolizing an endless connection to God; a wooden comb symbolizing the importance of leading a clean and healthy lifestyle; and undergarments symbolizing the promise to uphold the sanctity of marriage.\n\nImportant ceremonies\n\nThe most significant spiritual event in Sikhism involves taking amrit, a holy nectar drink. The ceremony represents a commitment to the Sikh moral code.\n\nAs in other faiths, weddings and births are important. On their wedding day, spouses circle the holy scripture together. Parents use the Guru Granth Sahib to name infants, opening it to a random page and using the first letter of the first word to determine the first letter of the name.\n\nCommunity service\n\nSharing one's time, skills or wealth is key to Sikhism. \"Seva,\" or “selfless service,” is work done for others without expecting something back.\n\nMilitary tradition\n\nSikhs have fought in every American war since World War I. Some carry a symbolic sword to remind them of the importance of \"protecting the oppressed.\"\n\nMilitary mandates to cut hair and remove turbans spurred a backlash in the Sikh community. Earlier this year, the Army began accommodating beards, turbans and hijabs worn for religious reasons.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/14"}]}

In 2021, Joann was still majority-owned by Leonard Green & Partners and went public at an initial public offering at $12 a share.\n\nThe company went private again after completing the bankruptcy process, however, with shares no longer listed by the Nasdaq or any other national stock exchange. At the time, CEO Scott Sekella said 95% of Joann's 815 operating stores were profitable. He later left the company and was replaced by interim CEO Michael Prendergast, who joined the company along with other new executives.\n\nIn a statement to Retail Dive, Joann’s director of corporate communications Amanda Hayes said the locations are being closed \"as part of routine store location evaluation and optimization\" and not a major shuttering event. \"We also opened new and remodeled locations in recent months, including new stores in Great Falls, MT and Maplewood, MN,\" she said.\n\nNeed a break?

However, the last several years have presented significant and lasting challenges in the retail environment, which, coupled with our current financial position and constrained inventory levels, forced us to take this step.\n\n\"After carefully reviewing all available strategic paths, we have determined that initiating a court supervised sale process is the best course of action to maximize the value of the business.

Reasons behind bankruptcy\n\nThe closures are due to a sales agreement with Nexus Capital Management LP. The company has agreed to take over all of Big Lots' assets and ongoing business operations. The move must be approved by the bankruptcy court.\n\nIn a previous SEC filing, Big Lots cited financial troubles as the reason behind the growing number of stores slated for closure.\n\nBig Lots' June public filing painted a dark future for the company, claiming that inflation has hindered American customers from purchasing goods. The filing showed the possibility of bankruptcy, stating the discount retailer may not be able to comply with its credit agreement over the next year. According to the filing, that \"raises substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\n“In 2024, the U.S. economy has continued to face macroeconomic challenges including elevated inflation, which has adversely impacted the buying power of our customers,” Big Lots' SEC filing said.\n\nThe retailer, like many others, has grappled with declining sales amid rising prices and a downturn in consumer spending. According to the financial disclosure, sales dropped 10.2% between the first quarters of 2023 and 2024, equating to a loss of about $114.5 million.\n\nBig Lots is among a handful of prominent restaurant and retail chains that have filed for bankruptcy since the pandemic, including Red Lobster, Rite Aid, Bed Bath & Beyond and Christmas Tree Shop.\n\nOther retailers have announced rounds of location closures to cut \"underperforming\" locations.

Well, now I have experienced it,” said Sherry Mills, an Indianhead resident.\n\nHer son and small grandson just happened to be staying over at her house the night before. “We all ran to the bathroom with no windows, it was unbelievable.

We should start seeing some circuits repaired here shortly.\"\n\nThat can lead to entire sections of neighborhoods being powered up.\n\nAt 6 p.m., Faris said 85 percent of the work to the transmission line is complete.

For the latest on recovery efforts, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden is sure to get a first-hand look at the devastation is Asheville when he visits North Carolina on Wednesday as part of his tour of the Southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused more than 100 deaths and left nearly 1.6 million customers without power as of Monday evening.\n\nBiden is less likely to see communities like Lake Lure and neighboring Chimney Rock, not only because they're more than 30 miles away and much smaller, but because they're barely there anymore.\n\nChimney Rock was largely submerged, its buildings swept away by the water and their debris blocking entry points into the village of 140 residents, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\n“What was once a town is now a river,'' said Tracey Stevens, who worked at the Chimney Rock brewery, now also wiped away. \"It’s beyond anything I can imagine.”\n\nLake Lure, a resort town of 1,400 people, also took a severe blow from the storm, which destroyed the town hall, police station and pier while washing away businesses.\n\nThe scene is not much prettier in normally picturesque Asheville, county seat of Buncombe County, or for that matter in much of the Southeast. Hundreds of water rescues have taken place across Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia since Helene's brutal landfall in Florida's Big Bend region late Thursday.\n\nAtlanta totaled more than 11 inches of rain in 48 hours, smashing a record that stood for almost 150 years. Western North Carolina took the brunt of the devastating rains, and more than 30 inches was recorded in some areas. Houses floated away from subdivisions, bridges crumbled, and semi-trucks were tossed into mangled piles. Mud, tree branches and food from local grocery stores flowed into the streets. The Associated Press reported at least 133 people have died because of Helene.\n\nForty of those fatalities have been confirmed in Buncombe County, County Manager Avril Pinder said in a Monday afternoon briefing, raising the total in North Carolina to nearly 50. Officials have received about 600 missing persons reports, although many are expected to be resolved when communications are restored.\n\n\"We don't have water and we do not have power across most of the county,\" Pinder said. \"The roads are still incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSome supplies were being airlifted because ground transportation was limited with so many damaged roads, and the county planned to begin distributing food and water Monday.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen from the National Guard. More than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets and high-water response vehicles, were feverishly working to save lives.\n\nOn the ground:How flood damage is cutting off North Carolina communities from emergency relief\n\nHurricanes, tornadoes, snow and heat: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter for more weather news and analysis.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene to between $145 billion and $160 billion. Helene is expected to be one of the costliest storms in U.S. history because of its overwhelming storm surge, winds and flooding, the weather service said.\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris will cut short a campaign trip and plans a visit to the storm-ravaged Southeast, her office told Reuters. Former President Donald Trump, who said he will visit the region, has criticized Harris for campaigning as the tragedy unfolded. He has also continued to hold rallies.\n\n∎ The South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 29 storm-related deaths, many involving fallen trees. Impassable roads and lack of stable power has forced several school closures in the state, some lasting through Friday.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Helene killed a minimum of 25 people in his state. In Tennessee, the state Department of Health has confirmed six weather-related fatalities across four counties, and about 100 people are reported missing. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency noted several county health departments have been closed due to the storm's impact.\n\n∎ Helene is one of the deadliest hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in modern history. Since 1950, only eight hurricanes have claimed more than 100 lives in the contiguous 48 states. Hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston and the surrounding region in 2017, killed 103.\n\n∎ Energy production in the Gulf was recovering. Only 3% of crude oil and 1% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remained shut down in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said late Sunday.\n\nStorm tracker:Hurricane Center tracking Tropical Depression Joyce, 4 other systems\n\nAsheville water system severely damaged\n\nIn the days after Helene swept through western North Carolina, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer cautioned that those in the county waiting for the water system to come back online must prepare for the long term.\n\n\"And I’m not talking about days,\" she told the Citizen-Times. \"We want them to plan for longer than that.”\n\nWith the city's water system \"severely damaged\" — which feeds not only the city of Asheville, but also Buncombe County and the northern portion of Henderson County — officials said that restoring service to the full system could take weeks.\n\nAssistant City Manager Ben Woody described the damage as \"catastrophic\" and said crews are still attempting to access infrastructure buried by debris or underwater.\n\nWater distribution began on Monday with four county run sites and one city site. As federal and state supply delivery lagged, though it eventually reached the county for its sites, the city spent \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars to purchase water through a private provider, said City Manager Debra Campbell.\n\n— Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nBiden sends FEMA chief to Asheville 'until the situation has stabilized'\n\nBiden sent FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to be on the ground in Asheville, North Carolina, \"until the situation has stabilized,\" the federal agency said Monday. FEMA teams are deploying to Mission Hospital and are currently treating patients, while another team is moving to Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine.\n\nTen federal search and rescue teams are on the ground in the region and another nine teams are on the way, for a total of 900 active personnel, FEMA said. Also being being brought to the region: 25 trailer-loads of meals, 60 trailer-loads of waters, and C-17 cargo plane full of food, water and other essentials.\n\nAccording to a news release, 200 federal ambulances have been provided to the state. The agency has also supplied 40 Starlink satellites to help with responder communications, and 18 helicopters are on standby to help deliver additional resources to affected areas.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDevastation like a scene from 'War of the Worlds'\n\nResidents in parts of western North Carolina where help has not arrived are fending for themselves. Taylor Shelton said her husband spent two days cutting through large fallen trees with a chainsaw to open a passageway for the couple and their three children to drive out of their darkened house in Yancey County, which abuts Buncombe County.\n\nThe devastation they saw along the way left them awestruck.\n\n\"It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,\" she said. \"We saw houses that are just washed away.\"\n\nShelton said the couple still hasn't been able to get in touch with her husband's parents in nearby Burnside, which was also battered by the storm.\n\nManheimer echoed the sentiment, noting that she was experiencing the same things — no power, no water, no Wi-Fi and limited to no cell reception — as many others in the county.\n\n“We are so lucky. Our house did not get hit,\" she said. \"Our neighborhood looks like a war zone.”\n\nIn the hours after Helene lashed the county, Manheimer and her youngest son donned backpacks and went looking for her dad, who lives a mile-and-a-half away. The scene, she said, was \"unbelievable.\"\n\nThey picked through the wreckage of the neighborhood, navigating fallen trees, and downed lines, shimmying through gaps where they could. Her family, once everyone was accounted for, was safe, she said\n\nDeSantis sends rescuers for Floridians in North Carolina\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered rescue teams to mobilize air lifts for people from Florida who may be stranded in western North Carolina in areas with blocked roads and power and cellphone outages.\n\n“Operation Blue Ridge” launched Sunday, an effort similar to one he’d ordered almost a year ago to help Florida residents in Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, and from Haiti earlier this year amid that country’s political violence.\n\nRecovery efforts are ongoing in Florida in the aftermath of Helene. At least 11 people were killed in the state, including at least nine in Pinellas County − hundreds of miles from where the storm made landfall.\n\nDeSantis said he missed a call from Biden because he was in the air viewing damage. The governor added that the federal government should concentrate its efforts on helping those in western North Carolina, though he said Florida might ask for more federal assistance in the future.\n\n− Gray Rohrer, Tallahassee Democrat\n\n'Biblical devastation':Helene leaves trail of destruction\n\n'It's a race against time': Historic town begins digging out\n\nMARSHALL, N.C. − Days after flooding devastated this tiny town of less than 800 people, cleanup crews on Monday worked to remove thick mud and debris while business owners pulled belongings from waterlogged downtown buildings. The historic town, set along the French Broad River north of Asheville, was slammed by a deluge that reached to the first-floor roof of some downtown buildings. It also damaged a water-treatment plant across the river.Most of the town was without power and cellular service. The damage extended to some businesses that in recent years have become part of an artistic renewal in the downtown area. As excavators and equipment buzzed around him, Chad Adamowski and his friends were shoveling mud out of his tattoo and music store, hoping to tear out walls before mold set in. “It’s a race against time,” he said.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nLoss of cell service 'crippled' North Carolina town\n\nWhen Helene inundated and isolated communities across the Southeast, it knocked out cell phone service in Canton, North Carolina, at the moment residents needed it most, according to the town's mayor.\n\nThe loss of service \"crippled\" the town's ability to communicate during and after the devastating storm, leaving residents few options to get crucial updates and check on their loved ones, Mayor Zeb Smathers told USA TODAY.\n\n“I must also express my deep frustration and anger with the failures in cellular communication, particularly the inability to rely on services when we needed them most,” he said in a statement. “From the very start of this crisis, our ability to communicate with basic emergency services was crippled, and there is no excuse for this.”\n\nMaking cell communication accessible during a disaster should be something these companies have the resources and know-how to offer, the mayor said.\n\nMajor cellular providers have said they are working around the clock to provide temporary solutions and fully restore service. But the reality on the ground has been harrowing for people stuck without means to reach their loved ones or get help.\n\nCommunications in the region could be impacted for days, weeks or even months, and large companies need to do more to prepare for communication breakdowns triggered by disasters fueled by climate change, said Alyssa Provencio, a professor who oversees the disaster management certificate program at the University of Central Oklahoma.\n\n“Communication failure is not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when,'” Provencio said. \"We know that extreme events are occurring more frequently and with more intensity, and so whether you're talking about hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, it's something that will impact you and impact your communications.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWorld Central Kitchen distributing food in Asheville\n\nDisaster relief organizations are providing free food and supplies in the Asheville area amid massive, urgent need. Global relief organization World Central Kitchen began distributing free meals for the public on Monday. WCK is also providing meals in Florida and Georgia. The organization was founded by celebrity chef José Andrés in 2010 to provide fresh food on the frontlines of humanitarian disasters in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"Asheville, we are here,\" the group tweeted Monday. \"WCK is in North Carolina working to reach flooded communities and families stranded by Hurricane Helene.\"\n\n− Tiana Kennell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore:Power outage maps: Mass outages remain in Carolinas, Georgia, Florida after Helene\n\nWorry for neighbors amid communication blackouts\n\nIn Burnsville, North Carolina, Suzanne Vale on Monday posted the names of her neighbors in a group Facebook chat in hopes someone knows how they’re doing. She is among hundreds of people turning to social media for help to contact friends and loved ones in parts of the Southeast that were battered by Helene. Communication blackouts created by Helene's fury have made obtaining information difficult.\n\nAs the storm approached Florida, Vale and her husband drove from their Burnsville home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to their house in Dunedin, a coastal town west of Tampa. While their Florida home was unscathed, their worry immediately became centered on Burnsville, where washed-out bridges and roads have left residents trapped with no means to communicate with the outside world.\n\n“No one’s been able to get a hold of anyone up there. I’m sure they’re OK, it's just not knowing,” she said, speaking about her friends and neighbors. “It's beyond comprehension what’s happened.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\n'The whole side of the mountain came down'\n\nRED HILL, N.C. – James Waters watched Helene's torrential rains and fierce winds decimate his farm among the hilly slopes of Appalachian North Carolina, snapping trees, ripping out fences and causing a landslide.\n\nIt took him a full day to dig to the main road with a farm excavator. He found windy roads strewn with downed power lines, fallen limbs, thick mud and debris. In some areas, cars were washed into ditches. One neighbor found a dead body near a riverbank, he said.\n\nNo one had cell service or power. People couldn’t find out whether their relatives were alive or dead. Waters knew he had a huge recovery ahead of himself. But his family had survived. So, like others in the area, he first grabbed his chainsaw to help clear roads and check on neighbors.\n\n\"The whole side of the mountain came down,\" he said. \"Then it filled up the valley with mud.\" Read more here.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nNorth Carolina town bands together:'That's what we do'\n\nHelicopters, thermal drones used in some rescues\n\nDale Buckner, CEO of Global Guardian, said his international security firm has supported and evacuated over 400 people from disaster areas across the Southeast. Some of the rescues required helicopters and even thermal drones, he said.\n\n\"While we’ve seen the highest demand from clients in the North Carolina region, we are actively conducting wellness checks and delivering food and water supplies along the storm’s path,\" he said. \"The devastation ... and its impact will be felt for months to come.\"\n\nDid the historic Biltmore Estate flood from Helene?\n\nThe Biltmore Estate in Asheville is assessing damage and will remain temporarily closed because of \"significant flooding, impassable roads and widespread power outages in our region,\" according to a statement on the social media account for the historic house and museum. Museum officials were asking people to check biltmore.com/weather-update for the latest. As of Sunday, a message on the website said officials were \"working to reopen\" but provided no timeline.\n\nGeorge Vanderbilt’s 250-room French Renaissance château, which took six years to build in the late 19th century, was the \"largest undertaking in residential architecture in the nation,\" according to the estate website.

For the latest news, view our updates file for Saturday, Oct. 5.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. ‒ Rescue crews across western North Carolina searched Friday for scores of missing people following Helene's historic deluge that ravaged the Southeast, killing more than 200 people, swallowing whole towns and leaving thousands without power or drinkable water.\n\nThe storm washed out hundreds of roads and damaged bridges across the southern Appalachians, leaving residents in already isolated communities stranded amid widespread power outages and communication blackouts. Federal, state and local authorities across the region pushed further into the mountain suburbs, including those surrounding Asheville, clearing roads as food, water and other aid was airdropped to residents in need.\n\nCitizen-led volunteer groups in the mountains of western North Carolina have supplemented officials' disaster relief operations, delivering aid to stranded communities on-foot and by helicopter and mule trains.\n\nAt 226 confirmed fatalities as of Friday, Helene is the fourth-deadliest hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. mainland since 1950. The deadliest is Katrina, which killed 1,392 people in 2005, followed by Audrey in 1957 at a death toll of 416. Third on the list is Hurricane Camille in 1969, a Category 5 storm that made landfall along the Mississippi Coast and claimed 256 lives.\n\nThe Asheville Police Department said Friday that 270 of 300 people reported missing have been found alive and well. Police are working on 75 active missing persons cases in the city, with assistance from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHelene's death toll surpassed the milestone of 200 on Thursday, according to a USA TODAY analysis. At least seventy-two fatalities were reported in Buncombe County alone, which encompasses Asheville and many surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nMeanwhile, residents throughout the Southeast were grappling with the storm's immense damage.\n\nDena Banks, 41, lingered near the steps of her home in Barnardsville, North Carolina, and tried to imagine what it might look like to rebuild.\n\n“We lost everything,\" Banks said, standing beside her mud-caked belongings that were scattered across the porch and grassless yard. \"The house has got to be knocked down because it was waist deep.”\n\nFlyovers and satellite images:North Carolina, Florida before and after Hurricane Helene\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ North Carolina officials updated the state's death toll to 115.

The insects' homes have been destroyed.\n\nMatt Bertone, an entomologist at North Carolina State University, explained that yellow jackets are social insects that nest in the ground. If they don't have a home, they're going to be agitated and aimlessly flying around.\n\n\"So, basically, if their nest is destroyed, then they have nowhere to go back to,\" Bertone said. \"If they've escaped, if they haven't drowned, they're gonna be out and about, not knowing what to do.\"\n\nIn addition to the yellow jackets, Bertone said there's a good chance for an increase in mosquitoes due to the standing water left in Helene's wake.\n\n\"The water is where they breed, and anytime you have lots of standing water you're gonna have breeding sites for mosquitoes, so there certainly are more puddles and water just in containers and places that have been flooded,\" he said.\n\n– Iris Seaton, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nHelene damage estimates heading north of $30 billion\n\nStaggering estimates of economic losses are emerging amid Helene’s wake across the Southeast.\n\nEarly wind and storm surge losses are estimated between $30.5 billion and $47.5 billion, stated CoreLogic, a California-based provider of financial and consumer analytics.\n\nThat includes wind loss, insured and uninsured storm surge, and inland flood loss for residential and commercial properties across 16 states, the company said Friday. Insured losses are estimated at between $10.5 billion to $17.5 billion.\n\nDamage to homes without flood insurance is to be expected during infrequent intense flood events, said Jon Schneyer, CoreLogic’s director of catastrophe response. Much of Helene’s damage was outside designated special flood hazard areas, so it’s going to be “challenging to realize the full extent of impact to uninsured homeowners.”\n\nIn hard-hit Buncombe County, North Carolina, where there were 140,000 housing units before the storm, only 941 flood insurance policies were active in August, said Swiss Re, a global provider of insurance and reinsurance.\n\nVery little of the flood damage caused by Hurricane Helene in the South will be covered by insurance, said Monica Ningen, CEO of U.S. Property & Casualty Reinsurance at Swiss Re. That will “make the task of rebuilding the communities impacted all the more difficult.”\n\nWhile the number of people and housing units in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina has increased by 10–15% over the past 10 years, Swiss Re said, the number of national flood insurance policies has decreased.\n\n– Dinah Voyles, Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nForecasters eye system in Gulf, also monitoring Kirk and Leslie\n\nForecasters continue to monitor several tropical systems in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn the Gulf, a developing storm promises to bring heavy, potentially flooding rain to Florida starting Sunday and lasting into much of next week. Meteorologists still aren't sure yet if the system will become a named tropical storm, or even potentially a low-end hurricane.\n\nOut in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Kirk and Tropical Storm Leslie continue to spin far from land.\n\nLarge swells from Kirk could bring life-threatening surf to the East Coast of the U.S. by Sunday, the hurricane center said, also potentially threatening oceanfront homes in North Carolina.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Newport/Morehead City, North Carolina, said \"next week, long period swell from distant Hurricane Kirk could bring a threat for an elevated rip current risk, high surf, and ocean overwash to vulnerable areas and where dune structures have been compromised across oceanside portions of the Outer Banks.\"\n\nAnother system, Tropical Storm Leslie, is expected to reach hurricane strength by Saturday, but is no threat to any land areas as of Friday morning, the hurricane center said.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nBarnardsville residents forge ahead as best they can\n\nStanding on her porch, Tammy Hensley spoke on the phone with an accountant, trying to navigate the tangle of federal aid available to her and her neighbors after Helene tore through the region, bringing devastation to the small, Buncombe County community of Barnardsville.\n\n\"We're making it, but it's hard,\" she said.\n\nHensley, 58, has lived in Barnardsville her entire life, and never had she imagined the water could get so high. Her 1970s one-story brick house was destroyed. Some mobile homes had jumped their foundations. Stray porches splintered across her front yard.

Of the property's 14 trailers, all residents had gotten out safely, but two were still living there, despite the wreckage.

It was 1:51 a.m. Sept. 27 and Helene was starting to tear across western North Carolina as Jewelia Crowe, 28, gave birth to her son.\n\nTen weeks premature, Phoenix weighed just 2 pounds 10 ounces. Crowe told the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network, he cried until he settled into her arms.\n\nJust two minutes later, he was taken away and rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit. Almost immediately, according to Crowe and her fiancé Samuel Dillard, a transformer exploded outside, and a nurse let out what Dillard called \"a God-awful scream.\"\n\n“You could see the whole NICU light up,” he said.\n\nBut Phoenix was safe. The generators inside Asheville’s Mission Hospital had kicked in. The power stayed on, and despite the unfolding disaster and the pressure it put on the hospital and its staff in the days that followed, Phoenix has thrived.\n\nRead the full story here:Baby storms into the world as Helene rips Western North Carolina\n\nHelene's wrath renders most homes in North Carolina town uninhabitable\n\nBeacon Village was built in the 1920s for workers employed by the now-defunct Beacon Blanket Company, once one of the largest blanket manufacturers in the world.\n\nBefore Helene, 77 bungalows still dotted town east of Asheville. After the storm, only 11 are habitable.\n\nOn Thursday, homes and cars were caked with mud as people cleared pathways to their homes to salvage what was left.\n\nDerek Hughes, a longtime resident, said his neighbors used canoes and kayaks to rescue people. In one home, a hole could be seen in the roof where rescuers punched through to save people stuck in the attic. “Water was coming in both directions,” Hughes said. “It hit us like a freight train and then it was gone.”\n\nJoi McPherson, who was clearing mud-covered belongings from her home on Thursday, said the residents were not able to get any evacuation warnings because they didn’t have cell service. By the time they received some warning, it was too late.\n\n“It started at 7 (a.m. Friday) and by 11 we were afraid we were gonna die,” she said.\n\n– Kelly Puente, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\n'Catastrophic damage' hinders utility repairs in NC\n\nParts of western North Carolina ravaged by Helene will need to wait longer for power restoration as the widespread damage has hampered crews working in the mountainous region, officials said.\n\nDuke Energy crews have repaired 1.2 million outages in North Carolina since the storm struck the state late last week, said Bill Norton, a spokesperson for the utility company. As of Thursday, 170,000 homes and businesses in the North Carolina mountain region remain without power, including 78,000 in Buncombe County.\n\nAbout 105,000 customers without power live in areas where Helene inflicted “catastrophic damage,” Norton said, adding that it will take more time to get power restored in communities where grid infrastructure was washed away and roads collapsed.\n\nNorton added that heavy damage to transmission infrastructure is causing restoration delays. A substation that serves the leafy Asheville enclave of Biltmore Village, for example, was almost completely submerged in floodwater. “That substation alone is going to take 3-4 months to repair,” he said. In the meantime, the company brought in a 200,000-pound mobile substation from Garner, North Carolina, to power homes and businesses in the area.\n\n“This has been a storm like we have never seen in our history,\" Norton said.\n\nVice President Harris to travel to North Carolina\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Saturday will travel to North Carolina to areas damaged by Helene and receive an on-the-ground briefing about the recovery efforts.\n\nHarris – who visited Augusta, Georgia, earlier in the week – is expected to provide updates on federal actions being taken to support emergency response and recovery efforts in North Carolina and other southeastern states.\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited North and South Carolina on Wednesday and toured sites impacted by the storm in Florida and Georgia on Thursday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Monday visited the Georgia city of Valdosta.\n\nNorth Carolina and Georgia are both key battleground states in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nHelping Helene survivors:Here's how to donate\n\nNC hospital director describes hectic, heroic work for Helene victims\n\nDr. Matt Riester and his wife were about to head out of town to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary when Helene's record-setting rains began to wallop Asheville.\n\nFlood waters were raging and Riester's house went dark. The medical director of the emergency department at Asheville's Mission Hospital scrapped his plans and rushed to work, maneuvering past uprooted trees and downed power lines.\n\nWhen he walked into the hospital, it was a hectic sight. Patients poured in through the emergency room entrance, some with make-shift bandages and slings. One person had caution tape wrapped around an injury as a tourniquet. The hospital, which treats 275 patients on a typical day, attended to 600 and many of them were very ill, the doctor said.\n\nFor days, the hospital has remained filled with patients as staff and volunteers work dayslong shifts, taking to mats and air mattresses for a few hours of sleep.\n\n\"A lot of the emergency room staff, nurses, the doctors, respiratory therapists and techs, everybody, we're all in the same boat,\" Riester said. \"We all have families. We all have houses.

Found among the debris, Vanoy said, was one of le Roux's paintings – it was of flowers.\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 27, a “wall of water and rocks and tree debris” barreled through a neighbor’s home where le Roux and her fiancé John Norwood were sheltering. The couple was swept downstream, where Norwood was found pinned among debris, nearly a four-minute walk from his home.\n\n“I crawled around screaming, looking for her, and I just couldn’t find her,” Norwood told ABC News earlier this week. As of Wednesday, le Roux still hadn't been found.\n\nVanoy and Norwood are among hundreds of people searching for loved ones in the aftermath of Helene. Earlier in the week, officials said they've received some 600 missing person reports – a number that's since come down as rescue teams push further into isolated communities and communications are restored.\n\nRead the full story here:A 'wall of water' tore a couple apart.

While urgent warnings were posted on the county's Facebook page, no evacuations were ordered. Meanwhile, the nearby National Weather Service office held daily conferences with local officials, warning of the flood danger posed by the storm.\n\nOn Sept. 26, Buncombe County officials held a virtual news conference, warning residents of the forecast of “catastrophic” and “historic” flooding and suggested, for the first time, that residents in flood-prone areas should evacuate. “We cannot stress enough the seriousness of this situation,” County manager Avril Pinder said. “If you live in a flood prone area … you should take action now – right now.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, Sept. 27, as reports of flooding were becoming widespread, Buncombe County issued a mandatory evacuation order that beeped into phones via the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System, or IPAWS, FEMA’s system for local emergencies.\n\nBut at that point, it was too late to get out, said Clay Chaney, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Weather Forecast Office in Greer, South Carolina. “By the time you get a flash flood emergency, it’s way too late to evacuate,” he said. “At that point, your only option is to go to higher ground.”\n\nRead the full story here:Inside the race to alert residents of Helene's wrath\n\n– Rick Jervis, Chris Kenning and Daniel Dassow, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Marcus K.

For the latest news on severe weather across the country, including the Midwest and upstate New York, view USA TODAY's story for Wednesday, July 17.\n\nDamaging thunderstorms and a reported tornado prompted a statewide response in New York late Tuesday, as rain, hail, and heat threatened millions of residents along the East Coast a day after severe weather in the Midwest left one person dead.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches were in effect Tuesday night across several states, including New Jersey, New York, Delaware, and Maryland as the National Weather Service warned of dangerous winds, hail, and tornadoes. Parts of Northern Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma were also under thunderstorm watches.\n\nThe heavy rain Monday left parts of the Midwest at risk of flash flooding. A stretch of Missouri and Illinois was placed under a flash flood warning, hours after the National Weather Service issued a flash flood threat in southern-central Indiana into early Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the weather service, east-central Missouri was also hit with a tornado warning just after noon on Tuesday after radar detected a tornado moving at 15 mph. As of late Tuesday, more than 166,000 customers remained without power across Illinois and Indiana, according to a USA TODAY outage tracker.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency Tuesday as thunderstorms ripped through the state, knocking out power to more than 175,000 customers. The New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation was also assembling crews to assist with storm cleanup in Oneida County, where a tornado reportedly touched down and left a trail of damage in its wake.\n\nSevere weather on Tuesday comes after a \"complex of destructive storms\" moved across eastern Iowa into northern Illinois on Monday night, according to the weather Service office in Chicago. Multiple tornadoes were reported along the line of storms as it moved through the Chicago metro, the agency said, adding its staff had to briefly seek shelter from a tornado.\n\nThe weather service confirmed three tornadoes on Monday night. One tornado was confirmed by radar near Sugar Grove, a village about 46 miles west of Chicago, according to the weather service. Another two tornadoes touched down near Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nA 44-year-old woman died in Cedar Lake, an Indiana town around 45 miles south of Chicago, on Monday night after a tree fell on her home amid the severe storms, the Lake County Coroner's Office posted on Facebook.\n\nNo summer relief:U.S. cities with lowest air conditioning rates suffer through blistering heat\n\nFull dam failure in Illinois prevented after residents evacuated\n\nOn Tuesday, officials in Nashville, Illinois, a town about 50 miles east of St. Louis, issued an evacuation order amid the \"imminent failure\" of a local dam, putting the area at risk of flash flooding.\n\nSome residents reported waist-high levels of water inside their houses, according to the Washington County Emergency Management Agency, and one person trapped inside required a rescue. No deaths or injuries were reported as of Tuesday evening, the agency said.\n\nThe \"immediate safety concern\" had passed after there was no additional rain, the agency said Tuesday evening. The Army Corps of Engineers assessed the reservoir and noted that repairs will be required to maintain the integrity of the dam, according to the agency.\n\nThe agency added that the secondary dam reacted and helped prevent a full dam failure. Authorities said residents were allowed to return to evacuated areas but advised people to avoid travel due to flooded roads and decreased visibility.\n\n\"However, there is significant property damage from the flooding,\" the agency said in a statement. \"It could be quite some time before the impacted areas return to normal.\"\n\nThe announcement came after a flash flood warning was issued by the National Weather Service in St. Louis through 10:45 a.m. local time. Forecasters warned that thunderstorms and heavy rain on Tuesday morning could trigger \"life-threatening\" flooding of creeks, streams, highways, streets, urban areas and underpasses.\n\nBy 1 p.m. local time Tuesday, the county's emergency management agency had documented more than 6 inches of rain. Authorities said the local Red Cross was activated and a nearby shelter was established.\n\nNew York governor declares state of emergency\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency for the entire state late Tuesday after storms swept across central New York.\n\n“We are deploying assistance for localities as severe weather continues to move across the state,” Hochul wrote on X. “Continue to monitor your local weather forecasts & give first responders room to do their work.”\n\nThe New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services activated the State Emergency Operations Center to track the storm and support local authorities’ requests for assistance.\n\nTornado reportedly hits central New York town\n\nAuthorities in New York are urging residents to stay off the roads after a tornado reportedly touched down Tuesday and wreaked havoc on homes, historic landmarks, and power infrastructure.\n\nThe New York State Department of Transportation in Mohawk Valley said on social media that it received reports of storm damage from across the region with several damaged buildings and downed power lines.\n\nOneida County Executive Anthony Picente Jr. declared a state of emergency and said the city of Rome was most damaged but noted there were no reports of serious injuries.\n\nHe also warned restoring power to thousands of customers across the county could take several days due to the significant damage. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on X that she was in contact with local officials in Rome and deployed resources from state police and other agencies to support recovery efforts.\n\nRome Mayor Jeffrey Lanigan said the weather disaster was unprecedented for the city but urged residents to be positive.\n\n“Romans are resilient. And we’re going to build back,” Lanigan said Tuesday. “Give us the time and space we need right now and let our guys work, and I promise you Rome will come back even better.”\n\nThe catastrophic storm comes just days after seven twisters touched down in the central and western parts of the state. The National Weather Service is expected to determine on Wednesday whether Tuesday's system was a tornado.\n\nOn Tuesday, the weather service office in Buffalo confirmed that a tornado touched down in Canandaigua — a city about 27 miles southeast of Rochester — on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe EF-0 twister had peak wind speeds of 75 mph and was on the ground for two minutes, traveling 0.7 miles, according to the data released Tuesday afternoon. The tornado had a width of 75 yards and damaged trees and some homes.\n\nTwo confirmed tornadoes near Des Moines, Iowa\n\nThe weather service said Tuesday that an EF1 tornado traveled just over 7 miles through Urbandale, Windsor Heights, and Des Moines, as wind gusts reached 105 mph.\n\nThere were no injuries or deaths from the tornado. But the storm left behind damaged trees, homes, and downed power lines, knocking out electricity and internet for 10,000 people at its peak Monday.\n\nAn EF1 tornado also hit the Quad Cities on Monday evening. The tornado started in Davenport and moved east. It passed through Bettendorf and crossed the Mississippi River, making it to East Moline.\n\nWind speeds were as high as 100 mph, and the tornado traveled 8 miles. The max width of the tornado was 100 yards. It resulted in damage to trees, roofs, and cars.\n\nMonday storms caused by rare, destructive derecho\n\nMonday's series of storms was triggered by a derecho, according to Weather.com. Classified as a \"wide-spread, long-lived wind storm\" by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), derechos can come with fast-moving thunderstorms and showers.\n\nThe storms are rare but can cause destruction comparable to a tornado, according to the National Weather Service. Unlike tornadoes, they generally inflict damage in one direction, on a straight-line path.\n\nA storm must sustain winds of 58 mph or greater and leave a path of damage at least 250 miles long to be classified as a derecho, according to the weather service. Many derechos pack wind gusts that blow at more than 100 mph, toppling power lines and trees and wreaking widespread devastation.\n\nMeteorologists only see around one derecho every one to four years. They usually strike the eastern two-thirds of the country, and 70% happen from May to August, the weather service said.\n\nIntense heat wave threatens East Coast\n\nMeanwhile, scorching heat continued for the third week this month as more than 126 million people remained under heat alerts across the country on Tuesday, according to heat.gov. The Weather Prediction Center said scorching temperatures are expected to continue to grip the East Coast, with major to extreme heat risk possible.\n\nIn Baltimore and Washington, D.C., the weather service warned of a \"dangerously hot and humid\" day; temperatures were expected to reach 102 degrees.\n\nThe weekslong heat wave has already set dozens of records and will challenge more through the week, AccuWeather said.\n\nHurricane Beryl:Beryl produced so many tornado warnings it broke a record\n\nCold front brings heat relief, storm risk this week\n\nA strong cold front pushing across the central to eastern U.S. this week will bring an end to a wave of record-high temperatures in the region, the National Weather Service said Tuesday, though strong summer heat will continue to pose health risks.\n\n\"While record highs may be diminishing on Wednesday, the combination of another day of heat and high humidities will continue to produce life-threatening conditions,\" the weather service warned.\n\nThe cold front could also fuel widespread thunderstorms across the central and eastern U.S., the weather service said, which could cause flash flooding in some towns. The rain will be welcome in large swaths of the region where an unusually dry summer so far has spurred moderate to severe drought conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, the weather service said no relief is in sight for an unusually hot season in the West, where temperatures are expected to reach 5 to 15 degrees above average and little rainfall is expected.\n\n\"Given the dry conditions, hot temps and low relative humidities, fire risks will continue across large portions of the West over the next few days,\" the weather service wrote.\n\nOregon thunderstorms could fan wildfire flames\n\nAt least four wildfires blazed in Oregon on Tuesday as the governor declared a state of emergency ahead of thunderstorms expected in the Portland area into the evening.\n\n\"I urge all Oregonians to take extreme precautions, particularly with lightning in the forecast for this weekend,\" Gov. Tina Kotek wrote in a statement. \"It is incumbent on all of us to keep Oregon green and protect our communities.”\n\nKotek invoked the declaration specifically in response to the Cow Valley Fire, which had blazed through more than 133,400 acres and was only 16% contained, as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Portland also issued a fire weather watch throughout the Willamette National Forest, around 80 miles south of Portland.\n\nForecasters warned that lightning from thunderstorms expected to move over the area on Tuesday night could start fires in the dry environment. Winds from the storm could also spread the flames, the weather service said.\n\nMeanwhile, fires in Arizona had consumed more than 56,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nThe largest, the Freeman Fire, was three-quarters contained on Tuesday after it blazed through more than 32,500 acres.\n\nThe fire was sparked by a lightning strike last Thursday near Oracle, around 30 miles northwest of Tucson, and grew after it merged with another fire sparked by lightning, the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. Evacuation orders for nearby areas were lifted on Sunday.\n\nSnow in Philly in July?\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey issued a daily record report Monday morning saying a “trace” of snow at Philadelphia International Airport on Sunday set a new daily record.\n\nThe \"snow\" was really hail that fell in thunderstorms over the airport, the office stated in a post on X with a #TeamSnow hashtag. The \"trace\" of snow broke a record of 0.0 inches, set in 1870, the weather service office shared X. By Tuesday afternoon, the post had been viewed more than 166,000 times.\n\nUnder a policy of the National Centers for Environmental Information, hail is considered frozen precipitation under the same umbrella as snow, sleet, and graupel, the office stated in a response to its original post.\n\n3 suspected heat-related deaths at Utah parks\n\nEarlier Monday, the San Juan County Sheriff's Office in southeast Utah confirmed that a man and his daughter died late last week after they ran out of water during a hike.\n\nThe sheriff's office said it was notified at 5:45 p.m. on July 12 of a deceased hiker in the Canyonlands National Park. About 15 minutes later, a second deceased hiker was reported in the same area.\n\nThe National Park Service reported that the pair of hikers were a father and daughter \"who had become lost while hiking, according to the sheriff's office. The air temperature at the time of the incident was over 100 degrees, the National Park Service said.\n\n\"Dispatch informed NPS of emergency 911 texts from the hikers, reporting that they were lost and out of water,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement.\n\nThe father and daughter were identified as Albino Herrera Espinoza, 52, and Beatriz Herrera, 23, both from Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\nOn Saturday, the Santa Clara-Ivins Public Safety Department in southwest Utah said first responders were dispatched to the Snow Canyon State Park, where preliminary information showed two individuals \"suffering from a heat-related incident.\" The two individuals had signs of heat exhaustion and were transported to a hospital.\n\n\"While on the scene, a passerby contacted police and reported that a third individual was unconscious a short distance away,\" the department said in a news release. \"The individual was identified as a 30-year-old female.\"\n\nFirst responders determined that the woman was deceased, according to the department. Her death is being investigated by the department.\n\nDozens of heat-related deaths have been reported by state officials and local media this month. Although the death toll is expected to increase as the summer continues, experts previously told USA TODAY that the true death toll is likely higher.\n\nIllinois man dies after truck sinks in floodwaters\n\nOfficials in Rockford, Illinois, are investigating the death of a 76-year-old man who was trapped as floodwaters swept away a pickup on Sunday, the Rockford Register Star, part of the USAT TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe man was riding in the passenger seat of a Dodge Dakota truck as the woman driving tried to leave a parking lot inundated with flood water, according to the Winnebago County Coroner's Office.\n\nWhen the truck was pulled into a nearby creek, the driver escaped through a window and was rescued, officials said. The man was trapped in the truck as it sank below the water. Local law enforcement tried to pull him out, but could not rescue him.\n\nThe truck was pulled from the creek and the man was pronounced dead around three hours later.\n\nAuthorities have not named either the man who died or the woman who was rescued.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Kate Kealey, Des Moines Register; Casey Pritchard, Utica Observer Dispatch; Victoria E.

For the latest news on the storm, view our live updates file for Monday, Sept. 30.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − More than 2 million people remained without power late Sunday across the Southeast in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, including more than 430,000 in North Carolina, where the deadly storm pulverized homes, trapped residents, spawned landslides, and submerged communities under raging floodwaters.\n\nAt least 90 people have died across multiple states since the record-breaking storm hit Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 hurricane with 140-mph winds Thursday, before moving north through Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas and weakening to a post-tropical cyclone. The death toll is expected to rise.\n\nOn Sunday, North Carolina officials were still trying to grasp the level of devastation. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at a news conference that at least 11 people died in the devastated state, \"and tragically we know there will be more.\"\n\nBuncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said more than 1,000 people were reported missing through the county’s online portal but added that she expected the number to drop dramatically when cell service is restored. Rescue crews are “still trying to save every single person we can” in the hard-hit community, Pinder said.\n\nHundreds of roads were washed away, cellular service for over 250,000 people was cut off, and vast swaths of cities such as Asheville were left underwater. Cooper said Helene had become \"one of the worst storms in modern history for parts of North Carolina.\"\n\nOfficials said earlier that more than 200 people had been rescued in the state by water and helicopter crews.\n\nRyan Cole, the assistant director of Buncombe County Emergency Services, said the wreckage was overwhelming. \"We have biblical devastation through the county. We’ve had biblical flooding here,” Cole said.\n\nDeaths in eastern Tennessee as communities remain underwater\n\nAt least two people in eastern Tennessee have died due to the recent devastation caused by Helene, officials said Sunday. One death was confirmed in Unicoi County and the other in Johnson County.\n\n\"We do expect this number to change,\" spokesperson Myron Hughes of the Unicoi County Emergency Management Agency said during a 5 p.m. news conference. Tennessee officials reported that 153 people were still unaccounted for in the state as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nMany communities across eastern Tennessee were still underwater and coping with crumbled roads, unsteady bridges, and devastated utility systems. The remnants of Helene brought rivers to record levels and forced evacuations.\n\nLocal schools remained closed, including Carter County Schools which will likely be closed \"for an indefinite period of time due to the ongoing disruptions,\" count spokesperson Ivan Sanders said. In Elizabethton, Sycamore Shores Hospital had shut down but nearby hospitals were up and running, according to Sanders.\n\n— Areena Arora, Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nPower returning to many in North Carolina, but drivers hindering repair efforts\n\nCooper said the number of customers without power is down from more than 1 million to 464,000 on Sunday afternoon, and efforts are underway to restore cellphone service to the thousands without it.\n\nAttempts to provide relief and make repairs are hindered by residents driving in areas impacted by the storm, state officials said at an afternoon news conference, urging people to stay home.\n\n\"Travel in western North Carolina remains limited and dangerous,\" Cooper said, pointing out 280 roads are closed, including sections of I-40 and I-26. \"Please stay off western North Carolina roads.\"\n\nThe governor said Helene dropped 10 to 29 inches of rain on the mountains in parts of the state, resulting in life-threatening landslides and floods. That has prompted reports of up to 1,000 missing, and for some of their loved ones to go searching for them.\n\n“I know there are a lot of people who are concerned about relatives and friends they cannot get in touch with,’’ Cooper said. \"It’s one of the reasons we’re pushing so hard to get communications back up because we know a lot of these people are just simply out of communication and are OK.\"\n\nLines for gas and cash in flooded Ashville\n\nResidents in Asheville were scrambling for resources after widespread flooding and power outages caused gas and water shortages. Gas stations began to close on Sunday and businesses started to only accept cash, as many remain unable to process credit and debit purchases due to lack of power and spotty internet service.\n\nIn West Asheville, amid the distant clatter of chainsaws cutting through downed trees, a line gathered at BJ's Food Mart for its 9 a.m. opening. When the cash-only gas station and market opened, screams across the street could be heard: \"No gas! Cash only! No gas!\"\n\nIn downtown, an hour-and-a-half-long line had formed at the Wells Fargo building ATM. Residents were piling in to get cash for groceries, water, and gas. Some were trying to get out of town and others just wanted enough cash for the coming days.\n\n\"We came downtown looking for gas,\" Stephan Amann told the Asheville Citizen-Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"We were in line for one of the gas stations on Merrimon, but they ran out before we got there, which was inconvenient.\"\n\nAmann and his partner, who live in North Asheville, wanted to leave town but found no better options. \"We've tried, but it looks like there's really nowhere to go,\" he said.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nHelene the latest in increasing $1 billion-plus disasters\n\nThe U.S. has averaged eight yearly disasters that caused more than $1 billion in damage since 1980. But in the last five years, the number of such catastrophes has more than doubled to 18.\n\nHelene is only the latest, and the cost of its damage is estimated at between $15 billion and $100 billion.\n\nScientists who study the Earth's climate and weather say storms like Helene are more likely to occur in the future, prompting an insurance crisis as insurers reduce coverage on some markets – most notably Florida for storms and California for wildfires – or withdraw from them altogether.\n\n\"Natural disasters are natural disasters,\" said Ian Maki, an innkeeper in Cedar Key, Florida. \"But these don’t feel natural anymore.\"\n\nDaughter 'powerless and helpless' trying to reach her parents\n\nAs Helene battered the Southeast, LaNette Wimer sat on hold with the Red Cross for two hours Sunday morning more than a thousand miles away in Denver.\n\nWimer, 59, was searching for information about her parents, Don and Brenda Holmer, who have lived in Hendersonville, North Carolina, for the past 25 years. Hendersonville is south of Asheville, where Helene swept through leaving devastation in its wake.\n\nThe last time Wimer spoke to her family they made no mention of the coming storm, and she worries her parents, who do not have cellphones or internet access, were caught unprepared. When the storm hit, Wimer began frantically watching the news, scouring social media, and calling her parents’ landlines, getting no answer.\n\nShe said the Red Cross has agreed to do a wellness check, which could take up to 48 hours. Unsure where else to turn, Wimer said she’s been left with \"a lot of anxiety, a lot of fear, a lot of wondering.\"\n\n\"How are they eating? Do they have water? Do they have their medications?\" Wimer wondered. \"You just feel so powerless and helpless. Other than reaching out to anything I can find online, there's nothing I can do. It's very scary.\"\n\nNorth Carolina residents trying to connect with family members may call NC 211 (or 1-888-892-1162 if calling from out of state) to report missing loved ones. People in the affected areas can alert others that they are safe by checking in on Facebook crisis response or reporting themselves safe through Red Cross Reunification by calling 1-800-ED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767).\n\nHow to donate and assist Helene victims\n\nAs authorities assess Helene’s destruction along a large portion of the country, rescuers and other emergency workers have been deployed to hard-hit and isolated communities. Relief efforts and funds have also been created to help victims and survivors.\n\nFederal officials have advised against sending unsolicited donated goods or heading toward disaster-affected areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency noted there are no requests, at the moment, for donations other than money.\n\nHere are some organizations that accept donations to help those impacted by the storm:\n\nAmerican Red Cross : Red Cross volunteers from Florida to Tennessee are helping communities by providing food, disaster supplies, shelter, and additional assistance. The organization is taking donations to fund relief efforts.\n\n: Red Cross volunteers from Florida to Tennessee are helping communities by providing food, disaster supplies, shelter, and additional assistance.

His department planned \"welfare checks\" at homes to check those individuals.\n\nHelene wiped out large parts of Asheville, including businesses in the beloved River Arts District. Overlooking the district, the Riverlink Bridge, a central gateway between downtown and West Asheville, has become a sort of hub for gathering as residents reel from the historic damage caused by Helene. The French Broad River crested at a record 24.67 feet Friday and was still well above its banks at 12.68 feet Sunday around noon, according to NOAA.\n\nErin Quevedo, the owner of Balm Salon on Depot Street, was ankle-deep in mud attempting to save what she could of her business.\n\n\"The salon was completely destroyed. It looks like the water came up to about five feet inside,\" Quevedo said. Five hair stylists worked at the salon along with her.\n\n\"Right now, all we're doing is we're trying to salvage what we can,\" she said, noting that only a few things, such as hairstyle tools, were salvageable. \"It's really heartbreaking. I'm not really sure what we're going to do. I think it's just kind of one step at a time.\"\n\nOn Tennessee-North Carolina border, ravaged homes and roads\n\nERWIN, Tenn. − In parts of Appalachian eastern Tennessee near the North Carolina border, the damage from Helene’s deluge was evident Sunday in washed-out bridges, closed roads, destroyed buildings and lack of power for some residents.\n\nUnicoi County officials said restoring power could take weeks. Some residents said they had relatives who were still missing.\n\nAt a church shelter in Greeneville run by the Red Cross, volunteers made pancakes early Sunday for a handful of people still sleeping on cots after being forced from their homes. In Erwin, a town of about 6,000, those impacted by the storm streamed into a local high school serving as a shelter to get hot food, bottled water and clothing. Many were trying to figure out what to do next.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nDire situation taking a mental toll\n\nMany Asheville, North Carolina, residents expressed concerns over access to water as grocery and convenience stores have rapidly run out of supplies. Grocery stores have metered customer entrances, and the city and county had yet to establish water distribution sites as of early Sunday afternoon.\n\nBrandi Hayes, 37, and four of her children stood in a long, snaking line of more than 100 people outside the Ingles Markets in west Asheville on Sunday, hoping to buy water, bread, and other essential food items. This was one of the few open grocery stores they could find.\n\nHayes ran out of water Saturday morning and said she's gathered water from a nearby creek to flush the toilet. She tried to call her 18-year-old daughter, a student at Western Carolina University in North Carolina, to let her know she was OK, but there was no answer.\n\nHayes' 12-year-old son tried to console her as she broke down in tears and acknowledged the mental toll the disaster was taking on them.\n\n“We keep talking about (what) we’re thankful for,” Hayes said. “Some people don’t have homes.”\n\n− Jacob Biba and Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nIn West Virginia, fretting about daughter in North Carolina\n\nIn West Virginia, where the storm has left more than 35,000 homes and businesses without power, Twyla Bosley is waiting to hear back from her daughter, Sorida Gain.\n\nGain was riding out the storm in Marion, North Carolina, with her boyfriend, James McKinney, their dogs and chickens. Bosley said the last time they spoke Gain, 40, told her floodwaters had started to breach their basement.\n\n“That's been the last thing I've heard,” Bosley said. “I mean, I lost count of how many missing-person reports I made. I’ve been in contact with the sheriff's department in Marion and nothing yet.”\n\nBosley said she’s trying to stay positive, knowing that the lack of cell service and internet access is likely what’s preventing her daughter from reaching out. Still, she can’t help but worry after seeing images of the widespread flooding in Asheville, less than 40 miles southwest of Marion.\n\n“My mind goes to the worst-case scenario, you know, what if something did happen to her? What if she got trapped there?” Bosley said. “My daughter has a major fear of flood waters. She's scared to death of ‘em. I'm just hoping that she got away.”\n\nA scramble for survival:No time for shoes as Asheville family flees by boat, fearing they lost everything\n\nOver 2 feet of rain swamps North Carolina mountains\n\nOver 2 feet of rain had fallen across North Carolina's mountainous region in recent days because of a rare confluence of weather patterns over the eastern U.S. before Helene arrived in Florida on Thursday night.\n\nTiny Busick in Yancey County along the western border with Tennessee, recorded 29.58 inches in just 48 hours. In Asheville, record high levels were set on the French Broad River and the Swannanoa River near the Biltmore estate. The historic Biltmore Village nearby was nearly submerged after Helene tore through the area, according to aerial footage.\n\nAt least 5,000 emergency calls to 911 were fielded since Thursday. And with more than 200 North Carolinians requiring rescue following Helene’s torrential rains, local, state and federal officials mobilized to help. Read more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nThousands of National Guard Troops deployed\n\nThousands of members of the National Guard have been mobilized to join search and rescue missions and clear debris after Helene battered the Southeast.\n\nThe bulk of National Guard members were deployed in Florida, where 3,900 were stationed across 21 counties to offer humanitarian relief and security as well as cleaning up debris and rescuing residents from rising floodwaters.\n\nHundreds more were activated in Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia and Tennessee, where members rescued 50 patients and staff from a hospital in Unicoi County who were trapped because of extreme flooding.\n\nMadison County, Florida, residents recall horrors of Helene\n\nHurricane Helene made landfall around 11:10 p.m. Thursday just east of the Aucilla River's mouth, roughly 40 minutes south of Madison County, Florida.\n\nWinds ripped the roof off Kenneth Butler's home, which had just been fixed after Hurricane Idalia damaged it last year. During Helene on Thursday, \"it sounded like someone was grabbing tin and just throwing it everywhere,\" he said.\n\nWater drenched the home as the storm raged on. All he and his family could hear was the sound of a train whistle.\n\nDoreen Gross and the five grandchildren who live with her did not take any chances. Gross said her boss had a fully furnished, unoccupied house he was planning to sell and let them stay in it for the storm.\n\nBut the home's sturdy walls didn't shield them from the wails of the winds. \"The whole house was rattling, (the kids) were all scared,\" Gross said. \"We were all bundled together.\"\n\nIt was the scariest thing she had ever seen, Gross said − and she survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Looking outside Thursday night was like watching a scene from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" she said.\n\n− Elena Barrera, the Tallahassee Democrat\n\nBiden briefed on Hurricane Helene impact\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a major disaster declaration for North Carolina and ordered federal aid to supplement local recovery efforts. Biden also approved emergency disaster relief aid for Tennessee as local officials warned the Nolichucky Dam in Greene County was on the brink of failure and urged about 100,000 residents to seek higher ground. Hours later, the National Weather Service ended its \"flash flood emergency,\" but a flood warning was still in effect.\n\nFEMA administrator Deanne Criswell will travel to Georgia on Sunday and North Carolina on Monday, the White House said, as part of the administration's effort to speed support to survivors and deploy more search and rescue teams to \"accelerate recovery efforts\" in North Carolina.\n\nHow many people are without power?\n\nThe worst power outages from Helene were in South Carolina, where nearly more than 761,000 homes and businesses were in the dark as of 11 p.m. ET, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker.\n\nIn Georgia, more than 583,000 were without power, in addition to about 432,000 in North Carolina. Florida also had more than 137,000 customers without electricity, and Virginia had over 104,000.\n\nAuthorities have warned it will take days for services to be fully restored.\n\nWhy was Helene so destructive?\n\nForecasters began warning last Tuesday that a confluence of weather patterns was coming together that would likely soak the Southeast and even farther north. A front overhead was going to interact with a plume of moisture being pulled in ahead of Helene.\n\nThe rain \"started well ahead of the storm, training up from the Gulf into our area, and circulation around the storm pushed moisture up from the extremely warm Gulf waters,\" said David Easterling, a rain expert with NOAA's National Climate Assessment Technical Support Unit.\n\nInteractions like this, with a band of moisture ahead of a tropical storm or hurricane, are called predecessor events and they’ve been documented in the past to cause heavy rains ahead of the arrival of tropical storms and hurricanes. Jet stream winds blowing aloft at more than 115 mph provided lift that further enhanced moisture in the developing storms.\n\nAlong the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, almost 10 inches of rain fell in Asheville and 8 inches in Tryon, according to preliminary weather service data. Another 6 fell over the two days in Bristol-Johnson, Tennessee, and more than 4 inches in Knoxville.\n\n−Dinah Voyles-Pulver\n\nAre other storms brewing in the Atlantic?\n\nForecasters were keeping watch on the Atlantic as hurricane season approaches its last two months.\n\nTropical Storm Joyce, which formed in the central Atlantic Ocean on Friday, was about 920 miles east-northeast of the Leeward Islands late Sunday and was gradually weakening. There was no threat to land.\n\nHurricane Isaac was about 535 miles north-northwest of the Azores moving over the open Atlantic, hurricane officials said. There was also no current threat to land.\n\nAn 11 p.m. ET advisory from the National Hurricane Center noted a tropical depression in the eastern tropical Atlantic, currently known simply as \"12,\" is expected to strengthen over the open Atlantic over the next several days. However, it's not expected to threaten the U.S.\n\nContributing: Michael Loria and Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/05/13/tallahassee-tornado-updates-more-severe-storms-threaten-amid-recovery/73668333007/", "title": "Tallahassee tornado updates: Recovery continues; schools closed ...", "text": "Tallahassee is bracing for the possibility of multiple rounds of severe weather today and Tuesday as the city continues to recover from three tornadoes and 100-mph straight-line winds that caused widespread wreckage just three days ago.\n\nBoth the city and county have opened sandbag locations in preparation for the storms, which comes at the same time that city and mutual aid electric repair crews are still working to fully restore power, bringing the number of customers in the dark below 10,000 Monday morning.\n\nThe threat diminished late Thursday afternoon, but the city faces another round of potential severe weather on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Weather Service in Tallahassee confirmed the paths of three tornadoes, two EF-2s and one EF-1, that hit the city. One woman was killed when a tree fell on her home off Aenon Church Road.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nHow state offices are affected by recent weather\n\nTallahassee-based workers for the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services have been asked to report at noon Tuesday, spokesperson Jessica Kelleher said.\n\n\"This will give us a chance to assess connectivity and any other storm impact,\" she said in an email. \"We will adjust our report times accordingly.\"\n\nKylie Mason, communications director for Attorney General Ashley Moody, said Moody’s top staff is “monitoring the weather conditions overnight and will make a decision first thing in the morning” about when Tallahassee offices will open.\n\nA call to the governor's office about executive branch agencies in Tallahassee was not returned by Monday evening but a spokesperson for the Department of Management Services, the state's real estate manager, said \"all DMS-managed facilities stayed open (Monday), except for the Bob Martinez Center (on Blair Stone Road). It’s still closed because power hasn’t been restored after last week’s storm.\"\n\nPSC reporting more Tallahassee power outages\n\nAfter a swath of bad weather Monday, the Florida Public Service Commission is reporting more power outages under the City of Tallahassee in the evening than it did in the morning.\n\nThe PSC reported 15,150 customer outages at 5:55 p.m. Monday. That number was at 9,574 in its data released 12 hours before.\n\nMeanwhile, the city's outage map, which often over the last several days has lagged behind the PSC data, is reporting less than 13,000 customer outages.\n\nLeon County Schools closed Tuesday amid possibility of severe weather\n\nThe School District made the call.\n\nThis is the letter that went out to parents, employees and the media.\n\n\"Schools will be closed in Leon County on Tuesday, May 14 due to anticipated severe weather entering our area beginning at 6:00 a.m. potentially making roads impassable and compounding the impacts of the previous severe weather in our area.\"\n\n\"The decision to close schools was made after consulting with the National Weather Service, Leon County Emergency Management and getting feedback from every LCS principal.\"\n\n\"We are in communication with the Florida Department of Education in regards to required instructional minutes to confirm that our seniors in the class of 2024 will have enough hours to graduate without having to extend the school year.\"\n\n\"Our high schools will be adjusting their AP & IB schedules and each school will communicate directly with those students waiting to take a test. Make ups will be scheduled during the required late testing windows identified by the AP and IB organizations — not LCS.\"\n\n\"Bus routes will be checked in the afternoon to identify any possible issues prior to Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Non-school based District staff is expected to arrive to work by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.\"\n\n\"If weather permits, some schools may proceed with afterschool and evening activities.\"\n\nSevere weather threat diminished; Leon County no longer under tornado watch, but forecasters say to stay on guard\n\nAnd now for some good news.\n\n\"Rain-cooled and stable air has brought an end to the tornado/severe threat for many,\" the National Weather Service posted on X. \"Still watching some areas across the coastal areas of the Apalachee Bay and the southeast Big Bend for a severe threat.\"\n\nLeon County was even removed from the tornado watch, but it remains for neighboring counties.\n\n\"There will still be heavy rain through the afternoon hours but we'll likely see a lull in the activity for much of the evening,\" the agency wrote.\n\nInitially, forecasters feared that the area – already reeling from an unprecedented trifecta of tornadoes – could see 75 mph winds and significant flooding.\n\nBut based on radar trends and observations, that threat has diminished as the storm has become more of a coastal threat.\n\nForecasters still warn the situation could shift after the storm system lashed inland cities to the west. For example, Milton clocked an 82 mph gust earlier in the day.\n\nIsrael Gonzalez, with the National Weather Service of Tallahassee, also warned that even moderate rain can undermine the foundation of trees already weakened by Friday's tornadoes.\n\nThe region will also have to be on guard Tuesday for \"renewed\" severe weather activity. Leon County is under a slight risk or level 2 out of 5 on the threat matrix.\n\n\"There is still some uncertainty,\" Gonzalez said. \"And still some reasonably high confidence that the threat is still there.\"\n\nLeon County Commissioner Christian Caban sets up emergency distribution centers\n\nAs soon as Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Tallahassee in the wake of Friday's storms, Leon County Commissioner Christian Caban got to work by issuing a resource request to the state to set up food and water distribution centers in his home District 2 and beyond.\n\nAs he toured damage and assisted in the recovery effort Saturday at Sabal Palm Elementary, Caban met with the governor along with county commission Chair Carolyn Cummings.\n\nThree locations opened on Saturday morning and have been running all weekend into Monday: Jane G. Sauls Fort Braden Branch Library, J. Lewis Hall Sr. Woodville Park and Apalachee Regional Park.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the sites had distributed 140,000 bottles of water and 35,000 ready-to-eat meals. More than 3,000 cars have visited the centers combined.\n\nThey also started distributing tarps early Monday morning ahead of incoming storms.\n\nCenter operations have been canceled for the rest of Monday because of adverse weather. They’re expected to open at an unknown time tomorrow morning and are anticipated to run through Tuesday at 7 p.m. pending weather.\n\nResidents can head to the centers and receive drive-thru service. For information on when the centers open tomorrow residents are encouraged to visit the county website: https://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/ei.\n\nMayor Dailey talks about historic damages, impending storm in interview\n\nTallahassee Mayor John Dailey called the damages from Friday morning's storm \"historic.\"\n\nIn a Monday afternoon phone interview, Dailey said he doesn't think any storm has caused more damage than what was seen Friday.\n\nBut now there's another storm coming toward Tallahassee. Depending on its severity, he warned it could delay power restoration efforts or inflict more damage on the power grid. He also addressed resident concerns about the city's outage map, which has been lagging far behind the pace of progress.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTallahassee might miss brunt of incoming severe weather\n\nThe brunt of the incoming severe storm threat may by most felt by some of North Florida's coastal areas, according to a recent post by the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.\n\nThat's good news for city residents, but bad news for places like Port Saint Joe, Panama City and Crawfordville.\n\nAll are encircled in a visual provided by NWS: \"The severe threat appears to be confined more to the coast (white outlined area) as cool and stable conditions from constant rain this morning and early afternoon has prevented the instability needed for severe storms from spreading north,\" it wrote at 2:33 p.m.\n\nOne family's story of storm destruction\n\nIt was a typical Friday morning in the Fore household. Mother, father and teenager daughter were set to leave their Lehigh Acres home when things suddenly were no longer typical.\n\nThey heard a loud roar and the next thing they knew the sound was in the house.\n\n“The ceiling was cracking down. The wind was coming in. Everybody thought they were going to die,” said Michael Fore, the father, in a Monday morning interview. “It sounded like you knew there was going to be a big crash.”\n\nThere was.\n\nA huge pine tree crushed two bedrooms of their Lola Drive home. No one was hurt.\n\n“I got the tree off the house, everything covered up and got what I could pack away,” Fore said.\n\nHe estimates it may cost $80,000 to repair and replace what was lost in the storm. An insurance company representative is scheduled to survey the damages Wednesday.\n\nMayor Dailey says coming storm could delay power repairs\n\nTallahassee Mayor John Dailey said the damage from Friday’s storm was worse than that from Hurricane Hermine, Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Irma combined.\n\n“Having said that, the electric utility crews have been working around the clock,” Dailey said in a Monday afternoon social media video. The city of Tallahassee announced shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday that it had restored power to 91% of its customers.\n\nBut Dailey warned the work could be delayed by another severe storm expected to hit later in the day.\n\n“We’re going to have the crews out working as long as we possibly can,” he said. “If it becomes unsafe, we’ll pull them in until it becomes safe, and then we’ll send them back out.\n\nThe forecast is calling for 2-5 inches of rain. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee says 75 mph wind is likely in North Florida and ping pong ball-sized hail is possible until 7 p.m.\n\n“We’re going to make it,” Dailey said. “We’re going to continue to move forward. We’re Tallahassee strong. Be safe.”\n\nNorth Florida, Big Bend, Tallahassee under a tornado watch until 7 p.m.\n\nThe region is now under a tornado watch until 7 p.m. with 75 mph winds likely, according to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee.\n\nThe NWS warns that scattered gusts of 75 mph are likely, which would surely complicate the momentous recovery process that is currently ongoing in Florida's capital city. It also threatens to plunge thousands back into darkness after city crews augmented by reinforcements from around the nation brought the number of outages below 10,000.\n\n\"A couple of tornadoes\" are also possible along with ping-pong sized hail, according to a post on X by the weather service.\n\nLeon County Schools closing at 1 p.m.\n\nLeon County Schools is closing again and cutting the school day short as a new threat looms.\n\n\"After consultation with weather experts and our school leaders, we have made the decision to close our schools at 1:00pm today (5/13/24) due to the possibility of severe weather this afternoon. Parents can choose to pick their students up early if necessary,\" the School district said in a post on X.\n\nAll afterschool activities have also been canceled.\n\nThe announcement is the latest schedule adjustment and then cancellation as school district adminstrators try to navigate the quickly changing dynamics of a recent barrage of sever weather.\n\nAlready administrators had delayed the school start time, cancelled busses and scrapped testing to get kids on school Monday.\n\nAmid a sea of angst and anger on social media, the district has been limiting comments on its posts and school announcements as parents have questioned the district's decisions.\n\nThis is a developing post.\n\nRounds of severe weather begin rolling into Tallahassee with threat of straight line winds\n\nThe National Weather Service warns that a wide swatch of the Tallahassee area should prepare for 40 mph winds and pea-sized hail over the next 15 minutes until 11:30 a.m. Forecasters expect multiple rounds of severe weather today and into Tuesday.\n\n\"Watching a storm move into Tallahassee,\" forecasters wrote on X. \"Brief 30 to 40 mph wind gusts are possible which could possibly bring issues to any weakened trees across the area.\"\n\nForecasters are particularly worried about straight-line winds, which wreaked havoc\n\n\"Straight line winds can cause just as much damage as a tornado.\" \"So if a severe thunderstorm warning comes out, it needs to be treated the same as a tornado warning!\"\n\nSevere storms, heavy rain possible with storms moving in today\n\nThe Tallahassee area is expected to see multiple waves of storms from an upper-level disturbance over the southeastern U.S.\n\nWright Dobbs, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said the first round of storms could arrive as soon as this morning or afternoon and that the threat could continue through much of Tuesday.\n\n“The main thing we’re going to be concerned about is that damaging wind potential,” Dobbs said. “But a few storms might have the potential for a tornado or maybe hail in some areas.”\n\nDobbs said residents in the Tallahassee area should be prepared for the possibility of 60 mph gusts, with higher speeds from the most severe storms. Flooding is a possibility, with the forecast calling for 2-5 inches of rain with higher amounts possible in isolated areas.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center shows a slight risk (2 on a scale of 1-5) for severe weather today and a marginal risk (1 out of 5) Tuesday. The risk is higher (3 out of 5) for places like Marianna and Panama City.\n\nThe Weather Service issued a flood watch for the central Big Bend and South Georgia, extending from the Apalachicola area through Tallahassee and up to Albany, Georgia.\n\n“In addition to the possibility of severe weather that all these rounds of storms could bring, we’re also worried about the potential for heavy rainfall,” Dobbs said. “Sometimes when we get storm systems like this that set up on an east-west boundary, we can get training storms, where storms move repeatedly over an area. And they might not bring severe weather, but they can bring very heavy rainfall.”\n\nCity of Tallahassee outages drops under 10K though lagging outage map shows many more\n\nThe city of Tallahassee announced shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday that it had restored power to 91% of its customers. The latest figures from the state of Florida showed that of the cities 126,309 accounts, 9,574, or 8%, were still without power.\n\n\"Crews including mutual aid will continue to work through the night and 24/7 until full restoration,\" the city said in a text message to utility customers.\n\nThe city said 400 mutual aid workers were assisting city crews in restoring the electric grid, with restoration resources five times higher than normal.\n\nThe city's online power outage map, which has not been able to keep up with restoration efforts in real time, continued to show incorrect figures. The map, which is lagging far behind actual numbers, showed more than 18,000 customers out as of around 10:30 a.m. An official with the utility says the map is overtaxed by the volume of outages and the pace of the progress.\n\nPower has been restored to all but 1,136 Talquin Electric Cooperative customers, according to the most recent state numbers. Some 4% of its 26,054 accounts were still down.\n\nContact Jeff Burlew at jburlew@tallahassee.com or 850-599-2180.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/09/27/north-carolina-helene-live-updates-asheville-damage/75409791007/", "title": "Asheville flooding recap: Mounting casualties; relief underway", "text": "Asheville Citizen Times\n\nEditor's note: Read our most recent live coverage here.\n\nSaturday's recap: Helene brought heavy rain and strong winds to North Carolina starting the night of Sept. 26 and into the morning after making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Florida.\n\nThe storm left more than 1 million customers without power across North Carolina immediately following the storm, including more than 440,000 in Western North Carolina.\n\nBuncombe County and most of WNC has no cell service. An unspecified amount of storm victims are believed to be dead but the county has not released any numbers. Emergency shelter is available at the WNC Agricultural Center and at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College.\n\nNorth Carolina has experienced some of the most severe flooding, with cities along the Blue Ridge Mountains, including Asheville, receiving nearly 14 inches of rain through Friday, Sept. 27. Other areas of the state reported more than 2 feet of rainfall, with Busick receiving nearly 31 inches and Spruce Pine recording 24.12 inches through 8 a.m. Saturday.\n\nFollow along for live updates here.\n\nBiden declares major disaster aid in North Carolina\n\nPresident Joseph R. Biden, Jr. declared that a major disaster exists in the state of North Carolina, according to a Saturday White House press release.\n\nThe president’s action makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the following counties and areas: Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yancey and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.\n\nAssistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.\n\nGov.

Here's how much rain parts of NC received\n\nMore rainfall through Sunday\n\nA Flood Warning is still in effect for Asheville and Buncombe County until 1:08 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The warning affects Swannanoa River at Biltmore in Buncombe County.\n\nDevastating, historic flooding continues across the French Broad and Swannanoa river valleys, following the historic 6 to 22 inch rainfall resulting from a stationary front interacting with tropical moisture and Tropical Storm Helene, NWS reports.\n\nMost of the French Broad River and tributaries have crested. While conditions will gradually improve, the floodwaters receding will reveal the extent of the damage.\n\nNumerous roads will require days to weeks of closure. Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive cars through flooded areas. Most flood related deaths occur in automobiles, the NWS said.\n\nWhy did Helene bring so much rain?\n\nEarlier this week, meteorologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned that a band of moisture associated with Helene, known as a predecessor event, was likely to bring heavy rainfall before the storm made landfall, according to USA TODAY.\n\nAs Helene’s massive circulation combined with this moisture, it resulted in even more rain before transitioning into a post-tropical cyclone. Recent studies indicate that some hurricanes are absorbing more moisture from the warming Gulf of Mexico, which further increases rainfall totals.\n\nHistoric Biltmore Village under water in Buncombe\n\nBiltmore Village is largely underwater after historic flooding by remnants of Hurricane Helene, later downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nBuncombe County officials announced Sept. 26 that residents in Biltmore Village in Asheville should evacuate ahead of Helene making landfall.\n\nMore:Video: See aerial footage of historic flooding in Biltmore Village after Helene\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Swannanoa River at Biltmore crested at 26.1 feet, nearly 6 feet above the record, at 3:45 p.m. Sept. 27. As of 10:30 p.m., the river was down to 20.9 feet. The previous record for that location was 20.7 feet.\n\nAccording to the NOAA’s standards, major flooding begins at 18 feet.\n\nAt the height of the storm, more than 500,000 Duke Energy customers in North Carolina were without power. More than 200,000 of those customers were in Buncombe County. That number had dropped to about 100,000 by late afternoon Sept. 28.\n\nA curfew is in effect for Asheville, starting at 7:30 p.m. and ending the next morning at 7:30 a.m. through at least Sunday.\n\nCanton Mayor says 'no excuse' for failure in cell services\n\nCanton Mayor Zeb Smathers called flooding to hit the area “an unimaginable and horrific disaster” before expressing frustration over cell phone service failures.\n\n\"I must also express my deep frustration and anger with the failures in cellular communication, particularly the inability to rely on services when we needed them most. From the very start of this crisis, our ability to communicate with basic emergency services was crippled, and there is no excuse for this,\" Smathers said.\n\n\"The idea that not just us here in Canton and across Western North Carolina cannot communicate to our citizens, families, and our emergency management is absolutely disgraceful. Our people and their families demand the best, especially in the historic moment that we needed it the most; something our cellular providers have not done.\"\n\nUltimately he said citizens and first responders ae exhibiting the utmost “grit and grace” during the disaster.\n\nHe asked residents to stay away from downtown due to instability and unsafe conditions.\n\nBill's Creek Fire will work into night on rescues\n\nBills Creek Fire Department is assisting North Carolina Emergency Management and the North Carolina National Guard in evacuations out of the Bat Cave area.\n\n\"You will be hearing helicopters most of the night tonight,\" the department posted on Facebook.\n\n100 people rescued in Lake Lure/Chimney Rock\n\nOver 100 citizens in the Lake Lure/Chimney Rock area were rescued Saturday, according to Rutherford County Emergency Management thanks to multiple efforts by law enforcement, fire departments, the National Guard and those assisting from other counties and states.\n\nRescue efforts will continue tonight.\n\nMore:See photos, videos of flooding and damage in Chimney Rock, Lake Lure, NC\n\nTransit transported those rescued to the RS Central High School shelter at 641 US-221, Rutherfordton, NC 28139.\n\nMission Hospital being overrun by cell service seekers\n\nFreelance photographer Josh Bell, present at Mission Hospital Emergency Room tonight, saw crowds of people trying to get cell service, no parking and people parked on curbs. A nurse who did not wish to be identified – and was directing parking traffic – told him that someone might have said that the hospital had cell service, and the word spread.\n\nParking lots were being overrun, and the ER was “suffering” because it was harder to see those in need of medical attention, rather than people seeking cell service.\n\nThe Citizen Times has reached out multiple times over the past two days to Mission Hospital, as well as to AdventHealth and Pardee in Hendersonville. We have not yet received any responses.\n\nCooper: Supplies to be brought by air\n\nSupplies are being brought into the region by air following devastating across Western North Carolina as search and rescue operations are underway.“Efforts are also underway to get power and communications restored, and we’re bringing in needed supplies by air,\" Gov. Roy Cooper said. More than 200 people have been rescued from flood waters in North Carolina following Helene’s torrential rains, North Carolina Department of Public Safety reports.\n\nTeams from 19 states and three federal teams are aiding in rescue efforts. Many areas in the mountains received more than 10 inches and as much as 29 inches of rain causing catastrophic flooding. High winds gusting up to hurricane strength also brought down trees, power lines and cell towers across the region.\n\nAcross North Carolina, 29 counties and 52 towns and cities have issued States of Emergency, in addition to the statewide State of Emergency declared by Cooper.\n\nCooper Saturday requested a Major Disaster Declaration from the federal government for North Carolina for 39 counties and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for federal Public Assistance and Individual Assistance in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene.\n\n'Disaster Roaming' activated for cell phones\n\nTelecommunications partners have activated \"Disaster Roaming,\" which allows any phone on any cellular network to access any available network to connect to. Telephone service providers are working to restore communications across the area, the state Department of Public Safety reported in a press release.\n\nCellular telephone service remains spotty west of I-77 due to significant infrastructure damage. “The State Emergency Response Team is working around the clock responding to severe impacts from Helene’s devastation. We are grateful for our local, state and federal partners and their teamwork to help North Carolinians hit hard by this storm,” said NC Emergency Management Director Will Ray. “Please remain aware of hazards and follow directions from local officials to protect life and safety.”North Carolina residents should call 911 only for emergencies and dial 211 for other types of information. Up-to-date information on local conditions, shelters, traffic, power outages and resources is available at ReadyNC.gov and from county government social media.\n\nBuncombe County opens emergency shelter, family assistance center\n\nBuncombe County is opening two shelters at AB-Tech Asheville Campus in addition to the existing emergency shelter at the WNC Agriculture Center, currently at capacity.\n\nThe shelters will provide refuge for individuals displaced by Hurricane Helene.

Access the Family Assistance Form directly here https://docs.google.com/.../1FAIpQLSeCZbJHoOE.../viewform....\n\nYou can also call 828-820-2761 and then listen to their message and then leave a message.\n\nAll information submitted will be reviewed by the Buncombe Search Team. The team will create and maintain a list of people who are currently unreachable and work with Buncombe County Emergency Operations Center to find information about their person.\n\n“We are committed to working tirelessly to connect people with their loved ones,” said Drew Reisinger, Buncombe County Register of Deeds.\n\nOfficials: 'Biblical devastation' leads to mounting fatalities\n\nThere have been \"multiple\" fatalities in Buncombe County as a result of Tropical Storm Helene, officials confirmed at a Sept. 28, 4 p.m. briefing, but officials did not provide an estimated count of those who have died.\n\n\"It is a catastrophic event, but now we are sad to report, it is a fatal event,\" Winston Parrish, senior pastor at Trinity Baptist Church and county sheriff's chaplain, said.\n\n\"Our emergency crews are not just conducting rescues at this time, but they are also recovering people who have perished in this tragedy. We know that this is just the beginning of what has been, and will continue to be, an awful and devastating natural disaster.\"\n\nBuncombe County Emergency Services Assistant Director Ryan Cole said the sheriff's department is working to compile a count of fatalities, \"and as we move forward we will try to have that information for the briefing from the sheriff's department.\"\n\nMore:Asheville, NC flooding: Multiple fatalities reported in Buncombe County, officials say; 'Biblical devastation'\n\n'Buncombe County's own Katrina': Family center to help connect families\n\nCity of Asheville and Buncombe County public officials have announced that they have been working on a service to help reconnect families as County Manager Avril Pinder called the disaster, “Buncombe County’s own Hurricane Katrina.”\n\nA family assistance center is being set up to help individuals find friends and family who may have been affected by the disaster. The Buncombe County Register of Deeds is leading the effort, where the county is encouraging those who wish to be reconnected with loved ones call 828-820-2761.\n\nIf you do reach your loved ones that are believed to be missing, the county encourages you to email buncombesearch@gmail.com, Pinder said.\n\n“Our emergency crews have been working nonstop,” Pinder said.\n\nThe emergency shelter for those who need emergency aid is located at 10 Genevieve Circle, Asheville, NC 28801.\n\nEmergency Services Assistant Director Ryan Cole said that call volumes for 911 are still very high, meaning a lot of emergency vehicles are still traveling the roadways. I-26 between Buncombe County and South Carolina has reopened as the only path for emergency resources to reach Buncombe County, Cole said.\n\n“Please do not drive unless you have to,” Cole said.\n\nThe county has performed over 150 swift water rescues, Cole said, noting that many mudslides are still occurring in the area. Cole called the flooding “biblical” in scale.\n\nFor those in the city of Asheville, a boil water advisory remains for all in the town who have water service, Assistant City Manager Ben Woody said.\n\nUpdates from UNC Asheville\n\nAccording to an alert sent from UNC Asheville's student alert system Sept. 28, classes are canceled until Oct. 9.\n\n\"Conditions at UNC Asheville are difficult,\" Chancellor Kimberly van Noort said in the alert. \"Significant tree damage has occurred, and parts of campus are inaccessible. Everyone is safe. Cell and internet coverage is nonexistent at this point ... We are providing security, food, water and comfort to the students remaining on campus.\"\n\nUNC Asheville spokesperson Michael Strysick told the Citizen Times Sept. 28 that approximately one quarter of students living on campus left before the storm, leaving around 1,200 still on campus. He said school staff went door-to-door after the storm performing checks on students.\n\nStrysick said UNC Asheville is coordinating with other UNC system schools and is looking into bringing mobile Wi-Fi to campus.\n\n\"We're doing the best we can under difficult circumstances,\" Strysick said.\n\nDowntown hotels are filling up\n\nNearly all downtown hotels are booked, and any with remaining availability have no running water and aren’t accepting more guests.\n\nJeff Elstro, the general manager of the Flat Iron Hotel, said the hotel has no water, no internet and is not taking guests. Yesterday, locals who went to the hotel searching for accommodations were unable to be helped. Most people at the hotel today are trying to leave, he said.\n\nJordan Hicks, a valet at the Restoration, said all 60 of the hotel’s rooms were full.\n\nOther hotels downtown, like the Haywood Park Hotel, have no vacancies or running water. The Downtown Inn and Suites was closed because it did not have water.\n\nThe Cambria Hotel Downtown Asheville, which posted on Facebook that it has a displacement rate for locals affected by Tropical Storm Helene, does not have rooms available.\n\nUpdates on I-26\n\nAccording to an update posted at an Asheville fire station, Interstate 26 has not opened in some areas past the Asheville Regional Airport. The update said there will be heavy traffic and road closures and the interstate should not be used \"unless it is an emergency and you have plenty of fuel.\"\n\nI-40 alternate route\n\nBuncombe County released an update from Highway Patrol shortly after noon on Sept. 28 asking drivers to use alternate routes that avoid Interstate 40 East.\n\nHighway Patrol is asking drivers to take I-40 to Interstate 240 to Interstate 26 if attempting to go south from Buncombe County.\n\nFor the most current road conditions, go to drivenc.gov.\n\nWidespread power outages persist\n\nMost people who went to bed Friday night with no electricity woke up Saturday still without power. And while Duke Energy has posted restoration times for some areas (one of which are in WNC), it's still a guess as to when power will be restored across the region. Duke Energy reports that more than 1 million customers are without power across North and South Carolina.\n\nBuncombe County was the hardest hit with power outages. At one point Friday, More than 200,000 Duke Energy customers were without electricity. That number dropped to around 100,000 Friday afternoon, and that hasn't changed much so far Saturday. Henderson County also was hit hard, with nearly 70,000 Duke customers without power.\n\nIn South Carolina, there are more than 230,000 Duke customers without power in Greenville County, more than 150,000 in Spartanburg County and almost 90,000 in Anderson County.\n\nHere are outage reports as of 11:30 a.m. Sept. 28 for WNC.\n\nDuke Energy customers without power\n\nAvery County: 805 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nBuncombe: 100,841 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nHaywood: 10,116 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nHenderson: 69,195 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nJackson: 9,642 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nMacon: 8,188 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nMadison: 404 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nMcDowell: 19,739 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nMitchell: 4,700 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nPolk: 11,448 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nRutherford: 28,715 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nSwain: 840 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nTransylvania:13,937 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nYancey: 471 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nFrench Broad EMC members without power\n\nBuncombe: 6,007\n\nMadison: 14,845\n\nMcDowell: 85\n\nMitchell: 5,575\n\nYancey: 13,863\n\nHaywood EMC members without power\n\nBuncombe: 2,522\n\nHaywood: 10,352\n\nJackson: 2,336\n\nMacon: 2,175\n\nTransylvania: 2,714\n\nAirlines mostly halted\n\nMost airlines are canceling flights today, according to a 10 a.m. update posted to the Asheville Regional Airport Facebook page Sept. 28.\n\nThe post said passengers should confirm their flight status with the airline before coming to the airport. Internet and phone service has been impacted by Helene. The airport is open and flights can take off and land, but the airport is facing \"operational difficulties\" due to the outages and staff being unable to get to work.\n\nSept. 28, morning update: No cellular coverage, rivers still at 'major flood status'\n\nThe morning after Tropical Storm Helene wreaked what Buncombe County has billed as a “catastrophic natural disaster,” dawned with all rivers still at “major flood status,” per an 8 a.m. news release from the county.\n\nSince Sept. 26, the county has received 5,566 911 calls and urged people not to call to report downed trees, power lines or outages.\n\nMore than 130 water rescue missions have been conducted.\n\n“I cannot stress enough how important it is to stay away from the water,” said Buncombe County Fire Marshal Kevin Tipton. “There are down power lines in the water, sewage in the water, and an incredible amount of debris. It is not safe.”\n\nThe 911 center will not provide updates on road conditions, power restoration or internet service, it said. I-40 and I-26 are impassable in multiple locations, and the county repeated a refrain from the day before: All roads in Western North Carolina should be considered closed.\n\nGo to drivenc.gov for current road conditions.\n\nLifesaving response continues to be the priority for emergency medical crews, according to the release, “however, they are beginning to triage other calls.”\n\nWhat about emergency shelter?\n\nThe emergency shelter at the WNC Agriculture Center in Fletcher is currently serving 400 people, with a capacity of about 500. An additional shelter at A-B Technical Community College will open as soon as roads into the location are passable, the county said.\n\nCellular coverage?\n\nBuncombe County remains without cellular coverage. There is no ETA for restoration, said the 9 a.m. release.\n\nWater outages?\n\nA late night update from the city, at around 9 p.m., said weather conditions have resulted in at least one significant water line break. As a result, customer in parts of the system are experiencing reduced or no water pressure.\n\nIt cautioned that fully restoring service to the water system will take “some time.”\n\n“Because large portions of the city are still underwater and many roads remain closed, Water Resources’ ability to assess the system is extremely limited. As a result you may experience low pressure or no water,” the news release said. “If you have water, but do not have the ability to boil it because of lack of electricity, please rely on bottled water for consumption.”\n\nBuncombe County has established a non-emergency line for community reports of things such as downed trees and debris at 828-250-6650.\n\nART service suspended\n\nA morning update from the city said Asheville Rides Transit bus services are suspended until further notice.\n\nInstead of regular route services, buses have been redirected to support relief efforts. ART was able to successfully transport over 578 individuals in need to shelters, the release said.\n\nCity buses were pulling away from the Harrah’s Cherokee Center shelter at around 7:30 p.m. Sept. 27, “special assignment” on the destination signs. Bikes sat in racks at the front of some of the buses.\n\nFrench Broad expected to crest at historic level tonight\n\nDuring the evening of Sept. 27, the French Broad River broke previous historic records set in the 1916 floods. The river nearly reached 25 feet in the late afternoon, breaking the July 16, 1916, record of 23.1 feet, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records. The river is expected to crest at 8 p.m.\n\nWestern North Carolina officials are calling the event the worst natural disaster of a lifetime.\n\nAt the same time, downtown Asheville seemed almost business as usual. Though the clutter of tree branches still sat on sidewalks, some bars were busy and overflowing onto the street. Some businesses have posted water outage notices, while others have closed their doors with darkened storefronts. Despite a 7:30 p.m. curfew, traffic lingered along Patton Avenue just 15 minutes before it.\n\nSocial media photos, videos show Helene's destruction\n\nAs Tropical Storm Helene rolled through North Carolina Friday, bringing heavy rains and floodwaters that will take days to recede, residents took to social media to document the destruction.\n\nThere were photos of people trying to escape from homes and videos of rivers overflowing their banks. Some areas weren't accessible Friday as the floodwaters continued to rise.\n\nMore than 3,349 calls to 911 in 10 hours\n\nAssistant Fire Chief Jeremy Knighton said the department is staffing over 200 firefighter who are actively “in the streets, rescuing our fellow community members.”\n\nCity and county officials encouraged people to text 911 if calls are not going through.\n\nBuncombe County Assistant Emergency Services Director Ryan Cole said crews are prioritizing “lifesaving missions.”\n\n“As calls come in for 911, we have to determine which have the highest priority,” he said. From 5 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sept. 27, he said the 911 call center received over 3,349 calls, where they were handling 9-10 calls per minute.\n\nMore than 130 swiftwater rescues have occurred since the beginning of the weather event.\n\n“We are unequivocally in the most significant natural disaster of our lifetime here in Buncombe County, and maybe in history,” Cole said.\n\nHe also acknowledged the “significant efforts” of first responders who have not stopped working for the last three days, and will keep going until the disaster is resolved, “which is not going to be anytime soon.”\n\n“This is something that we are going to be dealing with for many days and weeks to come. So please, be patient, work with us,” Cole said.\n\n“Do everything you can to look out for each other.”\n\nMore than 100,000 people remain without power due to downed trees and landslides, and there are more than 300 trees blocking roadways, said a 6 p.m. news release from the county.\n\nThe release said the new shelter, which county officials announced earlier was slated for A-Tech, was set to open Saturday, Sept. 28.\n\nDespite the rain clearing, flooding persists, the French Broad River has yet to crest.\n\nAny reported fatalities?\n\nBuncombe County officials said at the 4 p.m. briefing that they do not have a fatality count.\n\n“We have not gotten all our reports in from the field,” said Buncombe County Emergency Services Assistant Director Ryan Cole. “We are still looking at that information and will be compiling that. And once we get that compiled, once all notifications are made, then we will be able to look at that information and have that out.\"\n\nIn her opening remarks, Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder referenced \"possible causalities,\" and said officials did not have total counts for casualties, injuries or damage to personal property.\n\nCurfew announced for Asheville, starts at 7:30 p.m.\n\nA curfew has been announced for the City of Asheville from 7:30 p.m.-7:30 a.m. beginning Friday and running nightly through Sept. 29 because most of the city remains without power, Asheville Police Department Chief Mike Lamb said during a joint conference with Buncombe County.\n\n\"So that's going to be from nightfall all the way until dawn,\" Lamb said.\n\nThere have been more than 60 water rescues as a result of flooding from Tropical Storm Helene, Buncombe County Assistant Emergency Services Director Ryan Cole said. Almost 200 firefighters are actively responding to calls across the city, Asheville Assistant Fire Chief Jeremy Knighton said during the conference.\n\nThe curfew is being enacted to help make sure residents don’t accidentally wander into rising waters, officials said. Intersections are also dangerous for travelers because of downed traffic signals, they said.\n\nThird emergency shelter to open in Buncombe County\n\nBuncombe County will open a third emergency shelter at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College’s conference center, on Fernihurst Drive, County Manager Avril Pinder said at a 4 p.m. briefing livestreamed on Facebook.\n\nEmergency shelters were already established at the WNC Agriculture Center in Fletcher and at Harrah’s Cherokee Center in downtown Asheville.\n\nThere are more than 400 people at the Harrah’s, Pinder said, and it is close to reaching capacity. The Ag Center has about 150 people there now and a capacity of 500.\n\n“AB-Tech is being staffed up now. We don’t have power, as you know, so we’re working through what does that look like not to have power at a shelter,” Pinder said. It would also have a 500-person capacity.\n\nOfficials: Residents should heed evacuation orders\n\nThere are mandatory evacuations underway in several areas due to flooding.\n\nThese include:\n\nTransylvania County - Low lying areas in the town of Rosman around the French Broad River and the Davidson River Community will see door-to-door visits, advising residents of the need to evacuate now.\n\nBuncombe County - People between North Fork Road to Old U.S. 70, following the Swannanoa River all the way to Biltmore Village should evacuate.\n\nMcDowell County - River Breeze Campground on U.S. 221 Business North ordered to evacuate due to rising waters and flooding in the campground.\n\nMecklenburg County - Mandatory evacuation has been ordered for an area below the Catawba River below the Cowans Ford Dam.\n\nMore info and voluntary evacuation notices are posted on ReadyNC.gov/stay-informed/evacuation-orders.\n\nCell phones, wireless services down across state\n\nWireless services, including Verizon and Spectrum, are reporting outages across Western North Carolina.\n\n\"Hurricane Helene brought massive devastation throughout the area resulting in power outages and fiber damage from high winds, debris and flooding caused by the storm,\" Verizon Spokesperson Winnie Wright told the Citizen Times.\n\n\"In the Carolinas, customers are experiencing service impacts from Greenville, South Carolina up through Western North Carolina. Site repairs will begin as soon as it is safe to do so, with Verizon crews working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible.\"\n\nInside Harrah Cherokee Center shelter: Survivor tales and a waiting game\n\nAt about 3 p.m., Harrah's Cherokee Center shelter staff – comprised of Asheville city staff and volunteers – were working to hand out food along with blankets, socks, boxers, sports bras and deodorant to the roughly 200-plus people sheltered inside the events center. Cell service was spotty inside.\n\nNear the entrance of the facility, father and daughter Phillip and Madison Donati were sitting with their cat, Bandit.The Donatis were staying the night at the Super 8 off of Tunnel Road headed toward Black Mountain when they woke up to a phone alert around 6 a.m., informing them that they would have to evacuate, Phillip Donati said.\n\nRecalling the evacuation on Asheville Rapid Transit buses, Phillip Donati said they watched as \"big trees\" floated in the Swannanoa River on the drive to the shelter, where they'd been since around 8 a.m. He called the experience \"kind-of aggravating.\"\n\n\"Not ideal, but under the circumstances you can't complain,\" Phillip Donati said of the shelter. They said they hoped to get back toward Black Mountain soon.\n\nSuper 8 employee Anthony Stephens said that the evacuation was \"scary,\" because some staying on the lower level of the motel woke up with \"two feet of water in their room.\"\n\nLeo Bell, who was evacuated from the Super 8, described half of the motel as \"inundated.\"\n\nSome trucks manned by the National Guard also came to evacuate people, Stephens said, noting that, \"It was scary when we saw the trucks outside and all of the people in the water.\"\n\nHelene gone, but threats persist\n\nThe National Weather Service said Helene passed most of the Western North Carolina area at 11:21 a.m., but significant impacts including serious flooding continue. The storm passed into Kentucky a little before 4 p.m. and was headed north northwest at about 28 miles per hour.\n\nWind gusts had peaked for the event over most of North Carolina, but the NWS warns that tropical storm force gusts will remain possible through through late-afternoon over the northern North Carolina mountains and on all ridgetops.\n\nLandslides could still occur across the mountains, particularly until the last of the rain tapers off this afternoon or evening.\n\nFEMA Urban Rescue Team and National Guard in Asheville\n\nThe National Guard and a FEMA Urban Search and Rescue team are now on the ground in Asheville, revealing how serious, potentially life-threatening Helene has been and will be as rivers continue to rise.\n\nCity of Asheville emergency responders and staff from each department continue life-saving efforts in response to the tropical storm, according to a 2:30 p.m. news release.\n\nCrews are responding to calls for assistance, including swift water rescues, evacuations, transportation to shelters and downed trees on powerlines, houses and roads. Asheville Fire Department has upscaled their operations with up to 200 firefighters filling emergency response roles.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency and the North Carolina National Guard are in town to assist rescue efforts. A FEMA Urban Search and Rescue team is in Asheville with 82 personnel and 19 vehicles, including buses, tractor trailers, box trucks, tow vehicles and rescue boats. The National Guard team is assisting by providing a team of eight personnel and high profile vehicles that can navigate through flooded waters.\n\n“Even though it may appear that the storm has passed, we want the community to understand that the devastating after effects of Helene, including rising rivers, downed powerlines and power outages, flooded roads, and damaged homes, will affect our community for days to come.

An Asheville Rapid Transit bus picked up Koon and dozens of other veterans from the housing facility near the Swannanoa River in East Asheville, where Buncombe County officials ordered a mandatory evacuation in the early morning hours of Sept. 27.\n\nMore than 200 people were evacuated from the housing facility, according to Tim McElyea, ABCCM’s homeless services director. As of 12:30 p.m. on Friday, the site had not been impacted by flooding and it hadn't sustained any water damage, he told the Citizen Times.\n\nAvoid travel if possible, North Carolina Transportation officials say\n\nRoads are closed across Western North Carolina due to flooding, fallen trees, rockslides and mudslides.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation is asking motorists to avoid all travel in Western North Carolina, spokesperson Jen Goodwin said, noting that crews are responding but having difficulties with communication services and ongoing high winds. She suggested that those who have downed trees on NCDOT maintained roads call +1 (877) DOT-4YOU.\n\nBuncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said during an emergency news conference Friday that residents should consider \"all roads closed.\"\n\nHaywood County government officials said the same thing.\n\nAll lanes of I-40 at miler marker 67, near Old Fort Mountain east of Ridgecrest, are closed due to a rockslide. No injuries were reported. All lanes of I-26 at mile marker 51 in Henderson County are also closed, according to a Buncombe County news release.\n\nAll lanes of I-26 are closed south of Asheville between exits 44 and Exit 53 due to flooding. The road is expected to reopen by 2 p.m., according to DriveNC.gov. Goodwin said that many estimates for roads reopening \"are subject to change,\" as crews face rising waters and intermittent cell service. She encouraged residents to listen to local authorities on evacuation protocols.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation's road closures can be monitored live at https://drivenc.gov.\n\nEmergency shelters open\n\nEmergency shelters have been set up for residents who are unable to evacuate in some of North Carolina's hardest hit areas. Shelters are located at the WNC Agriculture Center located at WNC Agricultural Center: 1301 Fanning Bridge Road, Fletcher and the Harrah's Cherokee Center, 87 Haywood St., Asheville.\n\nThere are also Code Purple sheltering available through ABCCM for unhoused residents, and transportation on ART is free to Code Purple shelters.\n\nResidents should bring essential items such as medications, important documents and personal necessities, according to a news release.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders issued for areas of Buncombe County\n\nIn response to an escalating threat from Tropical Storm Helene, Buncombe County officials have issued an immediate and mandatory evacuation order for residents along the Swannanoa River beginning at the North Fork Reservoir, where waters have gone over the spillway. All residents in the following areas are required to evacuate: North Fork Road south to U.S. 70, U.S. 70 west to Old Farm School Road, Old Farm School to Azalea Road, Azalea Road to Swannanoa River Road and Swannanoa River Road to Biltmore Village.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were also issued for 105 Balsam Road from the Camp Ridgecrest for Girls south to U.S. 70 in Black Mountain due to the flooding of a lake at the camp.\n\nWhat to know about river flooding, advisories\n\nNOAA and USGS river gauges show flooding in WNC river basins. The flood stage begins at 9.5 feet, considered minor flooding.

There is also a flood advisory for the Swannanoa River at Biltmore affecting Buncombe County.\n\nThousands without power across the state\n\nAt the height of the storm in N.C., more than 450,000 in the state were without power.\n\nBuncombe County was particularly slammed, with more than 100,000 Duke Energy customers without power as of 8:30 a.m., while there were more than 63,000 Henderson County customers without power. Meanwhile, Haywood EMC reported more than 15,000 members were without power.\n\nThis story was updated to add new information and to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-thursday-live-updates/75384964007/", "title": "Hurricane Helene updates: Category 1 storm rumbles into Georgia", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene from Thursday, Sept. 26. For the latest news on the storm, read USA TODAY's live updates for Friday, Sept. 27.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Hurricane Helene made landfall Thursday night carrying catastrophic 140 mph winds as the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET near Perry, Florida. Hours later, the system weakened to a Category 1 storm and continued to produce hurricane-force winds as it moved toward Georgia.\n\nBy 3 a.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said Helene had sustained winds of 80 mph. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee said further weakening is expected as the storm moves inland.\n\nAt least one fatality in Florida was blamed on the hurricane so far, authorities said. Officials feared more fatalities would be discovered on Friday, though it would likely be several hours before any rescue personnel could head out to help those in need.\n\nThe storm has already forced closures of schools, airports, and roadways across Florida after Helene rapidly intensified within hours Thursday as it moved through the Gulf of Mexico. More than 70,000 people across four counties – Franklin, Taylor, Liberty and Wakulla – fled under mandatory evacuations as forecasters painted a grim picture of the potential destruction ahead.\n\n\"This will not be a survivable event for those in coastal or low lying areas,\" Wakulla County Sheriff Jared Miller said in a Facebook post. \"There has not been a storm of this magnitude to hit Wakulla in recorded history.\"\n\nForecasters warned that strong, damaging winds will \"penetrate well inland\" across the southeastern U.S. The hurricane center urged people to remain sheltered until Helene fully passed their area, warning that the center of a hurricane is deceptively calm, as hazardous winds rapidly intensify once the eye passes.\n\nHelene is expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday. In anticipation of the storm’s sprawling impact, President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations ahead of Helene's landfall for Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama to mobilize federal emergency management resources.\n\n“Helene is a very dangerous hurricane and could become a ‘once-in-a-generation storm’ across western South Carolina and North Carolina, as well as northern and eastern Georgia,” said AccuWeather senior director of forecasting operations Dan DePodwin.\n\nNews about our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nHurricane Helene tracker:See projected path of 'catastrophic' storm as Florida braces\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp confirmed early Friday that two people died after a suspected tornado touched down in Wheeler County, about 88 miles southeast of Macon. Emergency management authorities in a neighboring county, Jeff Davis county, urged people to shelter-in-place due to high winds in the area.\n\n∎ Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis confirmed one hurricane-related fatality late Thursday. A car driving on Interstate 4 in Tampa was hit with an overhead road sign.\n\n∎ Helene is the 4th U.S. landfalling hurricane of 2024. Only five other years on record have had four or more hurricane landfalls: 1886, 1909, 1985, 2005 and 2020.\n\n∎ Asheville, North Carolina, more than 400 miles from the landfall location, got 8.34 inches of rain over 26 hours from Wednesday until 4 p.m. Thursday, according to National Weather Service data. The estimated 1-in-1,000- year rainfall for 24 hours in that location is 7.25 inches.\n\n∎ The Florida Highway Patrol closed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, which links St. Petersburg to Bradenton, after winds at the span reached 60 mph and conditions deteriorated.\n\n∎ Florida State and Florida A&M Universities canceled classes but opened their doors to students and Tallahassee residents. The American Red Cross was using FAMU’s Al Lawson Center on campus as a shelter open to the general public; FSU was opening a refugee facility at the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center on Thursday to registered students who live off-campus.\n\nHow much damage could Helene do?\n\nIt's too early yet for detailed damage reports from the counties that Helene ripped across. But the National Hurricane Center says Category 4 storms threaten well-built framed homes with \"severe\" damage, potentially losing both roofs and walls. Most trees are snapped or uprooted and power poles are downed.\n\n\"Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months,\" the hurricane center says of Cat 4 storms.\n\nMore than one million utility customers in Florida were without power by midnight, according to a USA TODAY power outage tracker. The number was expected to rise as Helene moved further inland.\n\nIn addition to hazardous winds, the system is expected to bring tornadoes, life-threatening storm surge and rainfall to large swaths of the Southeast, with widespread totals of 6 to 12 inches. Isolated areas could be deluged with 20 inches of rain.\n\nAt midnight in Tallahassee, the storm had significantly intensified, with sheets of rain gusting from the sky. Electricity service in some of the city flickered intermittently.\n\nRainfall was also lashing Georgia, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina and portions of Tennessee. Atlanta, hundreds of miles north of Florida's Big Bend, was under a tropical storm warning.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and the Carolinas have declared states of emergencies as the fast-moving storm barrels through the Florida coast.\n\n\"We will likely avoid the brunt of this storm, but it is still expected to bring flooding, high winds and isolated tornadoes,\" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. \"Take proper precautions and monitor local forecasts.\"\n\nIn central Georgia, local news outlets reported that two people were dead after a mobile home overturned in a suspected tornado Thursday.\n\n– Christopher Cann, Doyle Rice\n\nLearn more on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale and the dangers of storm surge.\n\n'They’ve got to get out': Some residents ignore evacuation order\n\nFor some people, even the threat of \"unsurvivable'' storm surge is not enough to convince them to leave their homes. A Florida official from Helene's projected path finds that quite frustrating.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, whose jurisdiction covers St. Petersburg and Clearwater, admonished residents who refuse to heed an evacuation order when he held a Thursday morning news conference as Helene zeroed in on Florida's northwest coast.\n\n“We’ve got a problem, and the problem is that way too many people in Zone A aren’t listening,” Gualtieri said. “We’ve been out there this morning, there’s just way too many people in the area.”\n\nA storm surge of 5-8 feet is predicted for the county, putting residents of barrier islands and low-lying coastal areas in danger.\n\n“They’ve got to get out,'' Gualtieri said, \"and there’s going to reach a point where you’re on your own because we’re not going to get our people killed because you don’t want to listen to what we’re saying.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nSheriff takes grim tack with evacuation holdouts\n\nIn Taylor County, Florida, where Helen’s storm surge is forecast to reach 15 to 20 feet high, the sheriff’s office posted a message Thursday morning for residents who weren’t heeding the county’s mandatory evacuation order.\n\n“If you or someone you know chose not to evacuate, PLEASE write your, Name, birthday and important information on your arm or leg in A PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,” the message said. The post also asked residents staying behind to send an email to the office with their names, addresses, contact information and the number of people and pets at the location.\n\nThe small rural county on the state’s gulf coast was the site of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall in August 2023 and Hurricane Debby’s landfall in August.\n\nGene Taylor, a former public official in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, when Hurricane Katrina made landfall there in 2005, has another message he gives to people considering riding out a potentially deadly storm surge. “Have life jackets and an ax, in case they have to chop through the attic roof to get out.”\n\nMany people were rescued from rooftops when the water rose after Katrina and in other locations after severe flooding.\n\n− Dinah Pulver Voyles and Doyle Rice\n\nHead of FEMA to take first-hand look at storm impacts\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will visit Florida on Friday to assess the impacts of the storm and report back to Biden.\n\nCriswell said she would fly as close as she could to Tallahassee and meet with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his team. The FEMA leader said she would like to take an aerial tour if possible so she can see the damage for herself. Afterward, she is prepared to move up to Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, also expected to be heavily affected by Helene.\n\n\"Me being on the ground helps me validate some of the damage more quickly, so we can get major declarations in place faster,\" she told reporters at a White House briefing Thursday, adding the agency has the resources it needs to respond to this disaster.\n\nCriswell said FEMA has aggressively deployed resources in advance of Helene's arrival and advised those likely to be impacted to do the same, both in Florida and across inland locations far from the storm's landfall. Parts of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and the Appalachians could get up to 20 inches of rain and experience widespread flooding.\n\n\"Take the storm seriously,'' Criswell said. \"People in Hurricane Helene's path, you need to listen to your local officials. If they tell you to evacuate, please do so, and if they tell you to shelter in place, then that's what you should do. They're going to give you the best information that you can do for your specific situation. Those decisions can save lives.\"\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nDespite pleas from grown children, couple choose to stay\n\nAs the storm rolled closer to the coast, a small number of people in St. Marks made last-minute preparations amid steady rain and increasing wind.\n\nJohn and Melissa Hines, who own and operate the Sweet Magnolia Inn near the water’s edge, piled all of the furniture on their ground floor onto tables and moved a massaging armchair onto the landing. They were planning to stick around until the storm hit, then relocate to their son’s apartment about a mile up the road on higher ground.\n\nLegend has it their pre-WWII building was built using old railroad tracks from the line that used to serve the area, and it has withstood multiple hurricanes, John Hines said, though different storms have left their marks.\n\n“The building will remain. What we have to work with after remains to be seen,” he said Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe couple have four children, and the three who do not live nearby have been urging them to leave the area more quickly, Melissa Hines said. One of them, she said, even called their pastor in Ohio, who then reached out to add his encouragement.\n\n“Our faith is great,” Melissa Hines said, explaining why they aren’t seeking safety further from the storm. “Our pastor called and said, ‘Your kids are worried, you need to be wise. Stop being so stubborn.’ So we are going to leave but we’re going to stay close to home.”\n\nHelene could bring three times the rain it takes to cause landslides\n\nHelene is forecast to bring as much as 15 inches of rain to western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Mountains − well over the accepted threshold of 5 inches needed to trigger dangerous and potentially deadly landslides.\n\nAccording to Brad Johnson, environmental science professor at Davidson College north of Charlotte, \"Scientists established some thresholds in North Carolina in the wake of the 2004 Peeks Creek landslide, the deadliest in North Carolina in 60 years.\"\n\nThat slide, triggered by rains from Hurricane Ivan, killed five people. Johnson's group looked at weather data from that slide and found that 5 inches was roughly the threshold for landslides to occur, he said.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nManatees could be left stranded by Hurricane Helene\n\nFish, birds and other animals are all impacted differently by storms, depending on their habitat, food sources and other factors, wildlife experts told USA TODAY.\n\nManatees may become stranded or injured by debris from Hurricane Helene. In years past, they have been discovered after hurricanes in a dry bay, in a golf course pond and a retention pond. However, larger sea creatures like sharks and whales have likely been able to swim away from Hurricane Helene quickly, according to the National Ocean Service.\n\nAfter Hurricane Idalia in 2023, flamingos from Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula ended up in the U.S., in places they had never been seen before, including Missouri and Kansas.\n\nWhen fish die during a hurricane, the most common reason is low oxygen levels in water that has been pushed up from the bottom and may contain lethal hydrogen sulfide. Also, if there are long stretches of cloudy days amid a storm, oxygen-producing organisms and plants can't photosynthesize, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nRiding it out on a fishing boat\n\nIn Saint Marks, 30 miles south of Tallahassee where two rivers meet before emptying into Apalachee Bay, a handful of residents and business owners watched the water rising by several inches every 30 minutes on Thursday. Stone crab fisherman Philip Tooke, 63, stood on the dock of his family owned Saint Mark’s Seafoods, watching the rain and for signs the wind direction was changing.\n\nHe’s had head-height floodwaters beneath his building several times over the years, but he's worried what a 15-foot storm surge would mean. He and his brother planned to ride out the storm aboard their fishing boats.\n\n“I feel sorry for them to the east, but if we don’t get that direct hit we’ll be OK,” Tooke said. “It ain’t got ‘bad bad’ yet. It will be by tonight. It’s not going to be pleasant down here.”\n\nFlights canceled, airports closed\n\nNearly 1,200 U.S. flights were canceled by early Thursday because of Hurricane Helene, according to FlightAware. Tampa International Airport, St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport and Tallahassee International Airport in Florida all announced they will be closed for the day, but the storm's impacts extend beyond its projected path. Airlines began offering travel waivers earlier this week so customers could reschedule their plans around the storm.\n\nAnyone whose flight was canceled is eligible for a refund under Department of Transportation rules. Federal laws do not require airlines to compensate travelers for delayed flights, but carriers have committed to various degrees of compensation for significant delays within their control.

Because some are staying through the storm, so will he. His church is fresh from a roof repair done Wednesday in preparation for Helene. Now, he says, it's ready to keep anyone dry who needs a place to stay as the hurricane bears down on their town.\n\n\"We're going to trust the Lord − no matter,\" Nawlin said. \"He didn't ask us to understand everything. Just trust.\"\n\nMost Florida schools cancel classes\n\nMost Florida schools were closed Thursday ahead of Hurricane Helene’s landfall, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. The Florida Department of Education issued a news release with a list of school closures, and the department said it’s working closely with districts to get them the resources they need to resume normal operations as soon as possible.\n\nThe University of Florida in Gainesville was closed Thursday, and Florida A&M University and the New College of Florida closed earlier this week, through Friday, according to the education department’s statement. At least 33 other colleges and universities are temporarily shutting down their campuses, according to the Florida Department of Education.\n\nDozens of school districts across the state are also closed, affecting K-12 students, as the entire state is blanketed in hurricane and tornado watches.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nFlooding begins along southwest, central Florida coast\n\nFloodwaters began to inundate roads along the central and southwest coast of Florida on Thursday morning. In communities including Fort Myers Beach, Sarasota, Venice, Bradenton and several in the Tampa Bay area, officials have announced road closures as heavy rain and storm surge lead to flooding along coastal and low-lying areas.\n\nSanibel city spokesman Eric Jackson, citing widespread flooding across the Lee County island, urged people not to drive on flooded streets. Molly McCollum, a meteorologist with the Weather Channel, captured video of fish swimming on a street in downtown Sarasota.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center expects a surge of water several feet high to come ashore along most of the western coast of Florida, with the highest level – 15 to 20 feet – projected to wallop the panhandle and Big Bend coast.\n\n– Christopher Cann, USA TODAY; Dave Osborn, Naples Daily News; Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nCouple in their 80s decide to hunker down\n\nTaylor County Sheriff Sgt. Lee Harden's SUV pulled over Thursday at a home in the Steinhatchee coastal community, in the direct path of Hurricane Helene, after spotting a couple outside a home. Stan Ridgeway, 87, told the officer he's staying.\n\n\"I have to let you know ...\" Harden began, reciting the details about the expected surge. Ridgeway said he knew.\n\nLater, sitting in his living room, with his wife Jean, 81, Ridgeway said he bought his century-old house with its high elevation in mind. Floodwaters from Hurricane Idalia last year did not reach his home. Jean Ridgeway noted that this is the third hurricane since 2023.\n\n\"We didn't use to get hurricanes here,\" she said, then jokingly added: \"I think they discovered this place and they liked it.\"\n\nLesson learned, residents evacuate Horseshoe Beach\n\nHorseshoe Beach has become a ghost town ahead of Helene's anticipated landfall, the last few residents of the coastal community making final preparations before evacuating inland. The town was devastated by Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that hit Aug. 30, 2023, causing major damage to the eastern Big Bend and Nature Coast. Now it faces the prospect of a 10- to 15-foot storm surge. Or worse.\n\n\"We're just trying to get the heck out,\" Judy Paradis said as she and her husband, John, loaded their cars.\n\nAfter last year's experience, residents took the evacuation orders seriously, Judy said. The Paradises had just made Horseshoe Beach their permanent home last year after vacationing in the coastal town for several years. They said they have \"survivor's guilt\" because their elevated condo was spared when so many people lost everything.\n\n\"We try not to complain because we still have our home,\" John said.\n\nFlorida power outage map:Track outages as Hurricane Helene approaches from Gulf of Mexico\n\nSandbox sand pressed into service as storm approaches\n\nEmergency shipments of hurricane supplies have been flowing in all week at the Home Depot in Town ‘n’ Country, a community of more than 85,000 residents bordering the northern shore of Tampa Bay. By Thursday morning, the store’s supply of filled 50-pound sandbags had dwindled from 16 pallets to 3½ pallets, store manager Erica Jarmon said. In fact, those remaining bags were filled with play sand intended for children’s sandboxes.\n\n“Some customers are even using bags of soil out in the garden department. Getting creative – whatever kind of barriers they can actually use,” Jarmon said, standing alongside her remaining sandbags. Other hurricane supplies: included generators, gas cans, flashlights, sump pumps, extension cords, blue tarps, plywood and more, Jarmon said.\n\n“Fans are another big one, especially for mold, mildew, just trying to get any wet walls dried faster,\" Jarmon said. \"Bleach is another big one after the fact.\"\n\n− Rick Neale, Florida Today\n\nLongtime resident listening to Helene warnings\n\nThe usually bustling Sea Hag Marina on Florida's targeted Big Bend coast was mostly deserted Thursday ahead of Helene. Bobbi Patterson, 85, was moving anything that could get soaked − rugs, chairs, a sofa − from her home on the Steinhatchee River to another one she owns across the street. Patterson planned to evacuate to a motel in Gainesville. Her daughter, Susan Merritt, 63, was helping.\n\nIn the 40 years Patterson has owned her riverfront bungalow, it's flooded twice. She said the media tends to overhype storms, but she's taking this one seriously. Still, she said she hates to think she and her daughter were hauling furniture across the street for nothing.\n\n\"It's pretty much stripped,\" she said of her home on the river. \"It better be something happens.\"\n\nKatrina survivors wary of Helene\n\nIf a house was built after 2004, according to Florida building code, it will be likely to withstand 115-mph winds. But if a home was built before 2004, Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie urged people to \"make decisions on solid information.\"\n\nWith catastrophic storm surge expected along Florida's coast, northern Gulf Coast residents Gene and Margaret Taylor understand better than anyone about the tragedy storm water can bring. As Hurricane Katrina approached in August 2005, the Taylor family fled their Gulf-front home in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, heading miles inland to his brother's home. The now-legendary hurricane pulverized their home and community with a record-breaking 28-foot-storm surge.\n\nGene Taylor first thought his bare street looked like it did \"when the French first arrived\" in Mississippi during the late 1600s. \"We could never have imagined the house would be gone,\" he recalled.

Andy Beshear announced on social media that the following counties declared states of emergencies Friday:\n\nBoyd County\n\nBreathitt County\n\nClark County\n\nClay County\n\nLee County\n\nLetcher County\n\nMagoffin County\n\nWolfe County\n\nGov. Andy Beshear said the following cities declared states of emergencies Friday:\n\nAshland\n\nCatlettsburg\n\nClay City\n\nWinchester\n\nPower outages impacted roughly 221,000 households across the state Friday, Beshear said.\n\nAlex Vorst, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service Office Jackson, Kentucky, which oversees forecasting for many of the areas that sustained the worst damage, said fallen trees and powerlines were the primary sources of damage. Wind gusts above 40 mph and the damp ground caused by steady rain created conditions for trees and poles to topple over, he said.\n\nThe National Weather Service Office Jackson is close to verifying the damage within their territory with emergency dispatch centers in each of the impacted counties, Vorst said.\n\nParts of eastern Kentucky received rain Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the arrival of Helene's remnants. The mounting rainfall throughout Friday compounded the impacts of the wind, Vorst said.\n\n\"You're having essentially four days of nonstop rain. That's going to make soil saturated, and when you throw 40-55 mph wind gusts on top of that, it really makes it easy for trees to fall down. And that's a big part of what we saw yesterday,\" Vorst said.\n\nTony Edwards, spokesperson for the National Weather Service Forecast Office Charleston, which oversees Boyd County, reported a similar scope of damages in northeast Kentucky. Boyd County suffered significant tree damage, he said.\n\nWith trees still covered with leaves this time of year, wind has more surface area to catch and pull off tree limbs, Edwards said.\n\n\"When you get that kind of wind with trees leafed-out, it'll do quite a bit of damage,\" he said.\n\nThe number of people without power is steadily dropping. As of 11 a.m. Saturday, more than 130,500 customers are without power.\n\nWindy conditions are expected to fade throughout Saturday, though southern and eastern sections of central Kentucky could still see gusts at speeds 20-25 mph, according to the National Weather Service Louisville. Rain is expected to stick around through the weekend and early into next week, Vorst said.

Some members of President-elect Donald Trump’s inner circle are gearing up to battle “Big Food,” or the companies that make most of the food and beverages consumed in the United States.\n\nNominees for top health agencies are taking aim at ultra-processed foods that account for an estimated 70% of the nation’s food supply. Based on recent statements, a variety of potential politically charged policy options to regulate ultra-processed food may land on the Trump team menu, including warning labels, changes to agribusiness subsidies, and limits on which products consumers can buy with government food aid.\n\nThe push to reform the American diet is being driven largely by conservatives who have taken up the cause that has long been a darling of the left. Trump supporters such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose controversial nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services still faces Senate confirmation, are embracing a concept that champions natural foods and alternative medicine.\n\nIt’s a movement they’ve dubbed “MAHA,” or Make America Healthy Again. Their interest has created momentum because their goals have fairly broad bipartisan support even amid a bitterly divided Congress in which lawmakers from both sides of the aisle focused on the issue last year.\n\nIt’s likely to be a pitched battle because the food industry wields immense political influence and has successfully thwarted previous efforts to regulate its products or marketing. The category of “food processing and sales companies,” which includes Tyson Foods and Nestle SA, tallied $26.7 million in spending on lobbying in 2024, according to OpenSecrets. That’s up from almost $10 million in 1998.\n\n“They have been absolutely instrumental and highly, highly successful at delaying any regulatory effectiveness in America,” said Laura Schmidt, a health policy professor at the University of California-San Francisco. “It really does feel like there needs to be a moment of reckoning here where people start asking the question, ‘Why do we have to live like this?’”\n\nWhat is 'ultra-processed' food and why is it bad for you?\n\n“Ultra-processed food” is a widely used term that means different things to different people and is used to describe items ranging from sodas to many frozen meals. These products often contain added fats, starches, and sugars, among other things. Researchers say consumption of ultra-processed foods is linked — in varying levels of intensity — to chronic conditions like diabetes, cancer, mental health problems, and early death.\n\nNutrition and health leaders are optimistic that a reckoning is already underway. Kennedy has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches, restrict certain food additives such as dyes in cereal, and shift federal agricultural subsidies away from commodity crops widely used in ultra-processed foods.\n\nThe intensifying focus in Washington has triggered a new level of interest on the legal front as lawyers explore cases to take on major foodmakers for selling products they say result in chronic disease.\n\nBryce Martinez, now 18, filed a lawsuit in December against almost a dozen foodmakers such as Kraft Heinz, The Coca-Cola Co. and Nestle USA. He developed diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by age 16, and is seeking to hold them accountable for his illnesses. According to the suit, filed in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, the companies knew or should have known ultra-processed foods were harmful and addictive.\n\nThe lawsuit noted that Martinez grew up eating heavily advertised, brand-name foods that are staples of the American diet — sugary soft drinks, Cheerios and Lucky Charms, Skittles and Snickers, frozen and packaged dinners, just to name a few.\n\nNestle, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz didn’t return emails seeking comment for this article.\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, a trade association for makers of consumer packaged goods, disputed the allegations.\n\n“Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,” said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy, in a statement.\n\nOther law firms are on the hunt for children or adults who believe they were harmed by consuming ultra-processed foods, increasing the likelihood of lawsuits.\n\nOne Indiana personal injury firm says on its website that “we are actively investigating ultra processed food (UPF) cases.” Trial attorneys in Texas also are looking into possible legal action against the federal regulators they say have failed to police ultra-processed foods.\n\n“If you or your child have suffered health problems that your doctor has linked directly to the consumption of ultra-processed foods, we want to hear your story,” they say on their website.\n\nJunk food's effects on brain compared to opioid addiction\n\nMeanwhile, the FDA on Jan. 14 announced it is proposing to require a front-of-package label to appear on most packaged foods to make information about a food’s saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar content easily visible to consumers.\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are sounding the alarm over ultra-processed food. Sanders introduced legislation in 2024 that could lead to a federal ban on junk food advertising to children, a national education campaign, and labels on ultra-processed foods that say the products aren’t recommended for children. Booker cosigned the legislation along with Sens. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.).\n\nThe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held a December hearing examining links between ultra-processed food and chronic disease during which FDA Commissioner Robert Califf called for more funding for research.\n\nFood companies have tapped into “the same neural circuits that are involved in opioid addiction,” Califf said at the hearing.\n\nSanders, who presided over the hearing, said there’s “growing evidence” that “these foods are deliberately designed to be addictive,” and he asserted that ultra-processed foods have driven epidemics of diabetes and obesity, and hundreds of billions of dollars in medical expenses.\n\nResearch on food and addiction “has accumulated to the point where it’s reached a critical mass,” said Kelly Brownell, an emeritus professor at Stanford who is one of the editors of a scholarly handbook on the subject.\n\nAttacks from three sides — lawyers, Congress, and the incoming Trump administration, all seemingly interested in taking up the fight — could lead to enough pressure to challenge Big Food and possibly spur better health outcomes in the U.S., which has the lowest life expectancy among high-income countries.\n\n“Maybe getting rid of highly processed foods in some things could actually flip the switch pretty quickly in changing the percentage of the American public that are obese,” said Robert Redfield, a virologist who led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the previous Trump administration, in remarks at a December event hosted by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\nBig Tobacco was made to pay. Will Big Food face the same fate?\n\nClaims that Big Food knowingly manufactured and sold addictive and harmful products resemble the claims leveled against Big Tobacco before the landmark $206 billion settlement was reached in 1998.\n\n“These companies allegedly use the tobacco industry’s playbook to target children, especially Black and Hispanic children, with integrated marketing tie-ins with cartoons, toys, and games, along with social media advertising,” Rene Rocha, one of the lawyers at Morgan & Morgan representing Martinez, told KFF Health News.\n\nThe 148-page Martinez lawsuit against foodmakers draws from documents made public in litigation against tobacco companies that owned some of the biggest brands in the food industry.\n\nSimilar allegations were made against opioid manufacturers, distributors, and retailers before they agreed to pay tens of billions of dollars in a 2021 settlement with states.\n\nThe FDA ultimately put restrictions on the labeling and marketing of tobacco, and the opioid epidemic led to legislation that increased access to lifesaving medications to treat addiction.\n\nAny change likely to come at glacial pace\n\nBut the Trump administration’s zeal in taking on Big Food may face unique challenges.\n\nThe ability of the FDA to impose regulation is hampered in part by funding. While the agency’s drug division collects industry user fees, its division of food relies on a more limited budget determined by Congress.\n\nChange can take time because the agency moves at what some critics call a glacial pace. Last year, the FDA revoked a regulation allowing brominated vegetable oil in food products. The agency determined in 1970 that the additive was not generally recognized as safe.\n\nEfforts to curtail the marketing of ultra-processed food could spur lawsuits alleging that any restrictions violate commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. And Kennedy — if he is confirmed as HHS secretary — may struggle to get support from a Republican-led Congress that champions less federal regulation and a president-elect who during his previous term served fast food in the White House.\n\n“The question is, will RFK be able to make a difference?” said David L. Katz, a doctor who founded True Health Initiative, a nonprofit group that combats public health misinformation. “No prior administration has done much in this space, and RFK is linked to a particularly anti-regulatory administration.”\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. population is recognized as among the most obese in the world and has the highest rate of people with multiple chronic conditions among high-income countries.\n\n“There is a big grassroots effort out there because of how sick we are,” said Jerold Mande, who served as deputy undersecretary for food safety at the Department of Agriculture from 2009 to 2011. “A big part of it is people shouldn’t be this sick this young in their lives. You’re lucky if you get to 18 without a chronic disease. It’s remarkable.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/health/dementia-ultraprocessed-food-wellness/index.html", "title": "Ultraprocessed food may contribute to dementia, study says | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nWe all eat them — ultraprocessed foods such as frozen pizza and ready-to-eat meals make our busy lives much easier. Besides, they are just darn tasty — who isn’t susceptible to hot dogs, sausages, burgers, french fries, sodas, cookies, cakes, candy, doughnuts and ice cream, to name just a few?\n\nIf more than 20% of your daily calorie intake is ultraprocessed foods, however, you may be raising your risk for cognitive decline, a new study found.\n\nThat amount would equal about 400 calories a day in a 2,000-calories-a-day diet. For comparison, a small order of fries and regular cheeseburger from McDonald’s contains a total of 530 calories.\n\nThe part of the brain involved in executive functioning — the ability to process information and make decisions — is especially hard hit, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nMen and women in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods had a 25% faster rate of executive function decline and a 28% faster rate of overall cognitive impairment compared with those who ate the least amount of overly processed food.\n\n“While this is a study of association, not designed to prove cause and effect, there are a number or elements to fortify the proposition that some acceleration in cognitive decay may be attributed to ultraprocessed foods,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“The sample size is substantial, and the follow-up extensive. While short of proof, this is robust enough that we should conclude ultraprocessed foods are probably bad for our brains.”\n\nThere was an interesting twist, however. If the quality of the overall diet was high — meaning the person also ate a lot of unprocessed, whole fruits and veggies, whole grains and healthy sources of protein — the association between ultraprocessed foods and cognitive decline disappeared, Katz said.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods drag diet quality down, and thus their concentration in the diet is an indicator of poor diet quality in most cases,” Katz said. “Atypical as it seems, apparently some of the participants managed it. And when diet quality was high, the observed association between ultraprocessed foods and brain function abated.”\n\nUltraprocessed foods, like burgers and fries, could raise your risk for cognitive decline if it's more than 20% of your daily calorie intake, a new study found. d3sign/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nA lot of ultraprocessed foods\n\nThe study followed over 10,000 Brazilians for up to 10 years. Just over half of the study participants were women, White or college educated, while the average age was 51.\n\nCognitive testing, which included immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition and verbal fluency, was performed at the beginning and end of the study, and participants were asked about their diet.\n\n“In Brazil, ultraprocessed foods make up 25% to 30% of total calorie intake. We have McDonald’s, Burger King, and we eat a lot of chocolate and white bread. It’s not very different, unfortunately, from many other Western countries,” coauthor Dr. Claudia Suemoto, an assistant professor in the division of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School, told CNN when the study abstract was released in August.\n\n“Fifty-eight percent of the calories consumed by United States citizens, 56.8% of the calories consumed by British citizens, and 48% of the calories consumed by Canadians come from ultraprocessed foods,” Suemoto said.\n\nUltraprocessed foods are defined as “industrial formulations of food substances (oils, fats, sugars, starch, and protein isolates) that contain little or no whole foods and typically include flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, and other cosmetic additives,” according to the study.\n\nThose in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods were “more likely to be younger, women, White, had higher education and income, and were more likely to have never smoked, and less likely to be current alcohol consumers,” the study found.\n\nIt’s not just the brain\n\nIn addition to the impact on cognition, ultraprocessed foods are already known to raise the risk of obesity, heart and circulation problems, diabetes, cancer and a shorter life span.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods in general are bad for every part of us,” said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nUltaprocessed foods are usually high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which promote inflammation throughout the body, which is “perhaps the most major threat to healthy aging in the body and brain,” said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Meanwhile, since they are convenient as a quick meal, they also replace eating food that is high in plant fiber that is important for maintaining the health and balance of the trillions of bacteria in your gut microbiome,” Tanzi added, “which is particularly important for brain health and reducing risk of age-related brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nWhat to do\n\nHow can you keep this from happening to you? If you include ultraprocessed foods in your diet, try to counter these by also eating high-quality, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n\n“The conclusion suggested here is that ultraprocessed foods are, indeed, an important ‘ingredient,’ but the exposure that should be the focus of public health efforts is overall diet quality,” Katz said.\n\nOne easy way to ensure diet quality is to cook and prepare your food from scratch, Suemoto said.\n\n“We say we don’t have time, but it really doesn’t take that much time,” Suemoto said.\n\n“And it’s worth it because you’re going to protect your heart and guard your brain from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.

Start with kids", "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn America today we have a Type 2 diabetes epidemic. In America today we have an obesity epidemic. They are directly related, and both epidemics are getting worse. As chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, I intend to do all that I can to address this crisis.\n\nThe statistics are staggering. More than 35 million Americans are struggling with Type 2 diabetes – 90% of whom are overweight or obese. Unless we dramatically change course, these numbers will continue to grow exponentially.\n\nLet's be clear: This epidemic is not only endangering the health and well-being of tens of millions of Americans, it is also enormously expensive. According to the American Diabetes Association, the estimated cost of diabetes in the United States was nearly $413 billion last year. That's about 1 in 4 of our health care dollars.\n\nThe questions that must be asked are: Why is the number of children in America today who have Type 2 diabetes estimated to skyrocket by nearly 700% over the next four decades? How did it happen that the rate of childhood obesity in America has tripled since the 1970s and has gotten so bad that 1 out of every 5 kids in America and more than 40% of adults are now obese?\n\nThe answers to these questions are not complicated.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nPeople with diabetes need more:My son needs insulin to survive. Plans to lower drug costs are welcome, but not enough.\n\nCorporations have advertised us into a diabetes epidemic\n\nFor decades, we have allowed large corporations to entice children to eat foods and beverages loaded up with sugar, salt and saturated fat deliberately designed to be overeaten.\n\nThe situation has gotten so bad that most of what kids in America eat today consist of unhealthy, ultra-processed foods like sweetened breakfast cereals, sugary soft drinks, chicken tenders, hot dogs, french fries, frozen pizzas and chips that experts have told us lead to a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes. Even food that appears to be healthy like fruit-flavored yogurts and granola bars contains high levels of added sugar.\n\nAlarmingly, according to a recent study published in the British Medical Journal, ultra-processed foods, which Northeastern University’s Network Science Institute says make up an incredible 73% of our nation’s food supply, can be as addictive as alcohol or cigarettes.\n\nWhile the diabetes and obesity rates in America soar, while we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to treat diabetes, the food and beverage industry spends $14 billion a year on advertising to make many of their unhealthy products irresistible to the American consumer. Even worse, $2 billion is used to directly market food predominantly high in sugar, salt and saturated fat to our children in order to get them hooked on these products at an early age.\n\nAccording to the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, children and teens view about 4,000 food and beverage ads on television each year, an average of 10 advertisements each day.\n\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest has found that children who watch Nickelodeon and Nicktoons are exposed to more than 10 unhealthy food and beverage ads every hour.\n\nLast year, for example, Coca-Cola Co. spent $327 million on advertising in the United States alone while it raked in more than $9.5 billion in profits.\n\nNot one of their ads will tell you that drinking one or two cans of Coke a day will increase your chances of getting Type 2 diabetes by 26%.\n\nNor will their TV ads tell you that a 20-ounce bottle of Coke contains more than 15 teaspoons of sugar – over twice the recommended daily limit for kids.\n\nStart with banning junk food ads for kids\n\nThe time is long overdue for us to seriously combat the Type 2 diabetes and obesity epidemic in America. We must have the courage to take on the greed of the food and beverage industry that, every day, is attacking the health and well-being of our children.\n\nAnd a good place to start would be to ban junk food ads targeted to kids.\n\nThis is not a radical idea.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has estimated that if the United States banned fast-food advertising marketed to children, we could cut the childhood obesity rate by up to 18%.\n\nIs your kid struggling with math?They're not being taught the right way.\n\nIn the 1980s, Quebec banned junk food advertising to children under 13. Today, the province has the lowest childhood obesity rate in Canada and the highest consumption of fruits and vegetables of any Canadian province.\n\nThis summer, the World Health Organization called for countries to substantially reduce the marketing of junk food to children, and Norway announced that it would be banning all food and beverage advertisements to children.\n\nIreland, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan and several other major countries have either seriously restricted or banned junk food ads targeted to children.\n\nIn 2021, Mexico banned cartoon characters on food products and now requires warning labels on the front of food products that contain excess sugar, calories, sodium or saturated fat – something that we should also consider.\n\nThe food and beverage industry will no doubt do everything it can to protect the status quo and its ability to destroy the health of our kids. It’s not only billions in TV advertising. During the last presidential election cycle, the industry spent a record-breaking $42.5 million on campaign contributions to elect candidates who will protect their interests.\n\nEnough is enough. It’s time we stood up against an industry that puts profits ahead of the health of our children. It’s time that we do all we can to combat the diabetes epidemic.\n\nBernie Sanders is the senior United States senator from Vermont.

And the WHO also notes that or obese in 2016 nearly 20 percent of kids aged 5 to 19 were also overweight.\n\nAnd with obesity comes a greater risk of heart disease, many cancers and especially type 2 diabetes. It’s not a mystery then, that excess weight is linked to some four million deaths a year worldwide. So, what are some of the reasons behind the obesity epidemic in the United States?\n\nU.S. obesity epidemic\n\nThe push hypothesis notes that a combination of factors has pushed calories into the food system and subsequently changed what we eat, how much we eat, and our overall eating habits. A rise in calorie consumption per person is much more than enough to explain the increase in body weight.\n\nThe carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity does not appear to adequately explain how this contributes to obesity. That is not to say that carbohydrates have not contributed to obesity.\n\nIn the 1990s people who consumed a lower fat diet did not see a consequent decrease in obesity because some people replace some of the fat in their diets with refined carbohydrates. We were actually exposed to more carbs and more fat plus a little more protein, and we probably ate all of these in excess.\n\nIncrease in caloric consumption\n\nEstimates are that calories in the food supply have increased by about 500 to 800 per person a day. However, more food is being wasted, with about half to two-thirds of the increase going into the trash. The remaining calories generated the obesity epidemic. So, the average adult (at the population level) is eating about 250 to 300 more calories per day than the 1970s. Those suffering from obesity are likely consuming many more additional calories.\n\nCalories in the food supply were most likely due to a combination of factors including increased crop yields, changes in subsidies and other policies which led to a dramatic increase in soybeans and corn in the 1970s and 1980s. Policy changes drove down the price of ingredients like high fructose corn syrup while engineers figured out how to make stable, convenient and tasty processed foods.\n\nChange in eating norms and competition for consumers\n\nAs more women went into the workforce, we begin to eat out more at restaurants with less control on what we eat, an increase in snacking and consumption of convenience foods, which need only be heated as opposed to cook.\n\nWith competition as the corporate goal, companies want to make their foods as tasty as possible.

We have informed FDA and will conduct comprehensive testing in conjunction with the independent third party to ensure the plant is safe to resume production. This will likely delay production and distribution of new product for a few weeks.”\n\nAbbott said that once the plant is re-sanitized and production resumes, it will restart EleCare production, followed by specialty and metabolic formulas. New formula being produced since the plant reopened was not yet available to consumers, and production had not started on popular brands available at grocery stores. Abbott said it will “work to restart Similac production at the plant as soon as possible.”\n\nIn tweets Wednesday night, US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said, “We know Abbott is working quickly to assess the damage and will be reporting its progress to us in the days ahead. Once the company establishes a plan, FDA will be back in the facility working to ensure that they can restart producing safe and quality formula products quickly.”\n\nIn a Senate committee hearing on Thursday, Califf said it’s too soon to give an exact estimate of how long new product from the plant will be delayed.\n\nPlant closed for months\n\nThe plant had been shut down for months after an FDA inspection that found Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria, which can be deadly to infants, in several areas. Similac, Alimentum and EleCare powdered infant formulas made at the plant were recalled, and the closure exacerbated shortages caused by supply chain disruptions. Families across the United States have struggled for months to find formula for infants and for people with specific nutrition needs.\n\nCaliff said last month that the shuttered Michigan plant needed extensive repairs, including replacing the roof and floors.\n\n“You just can’t open a plant with bacteria growing in it,” he said during a Senate committee hearing. “I mean, would you go in a kitchen next door if there was bacteria growing all over the place, and standing water and people tromping through with mud on their feet? Which is essentially what the inspection showed.”\n\nIn May, a federal judge signed off on an agreement between the FDA and Abbott that laid out the steps the company needed to take to restart production. The plant reopened June 4.\n\nBut on Monday, severe weather moved across the upper Midwest and the Ohio River Valley, including Michigan.\n\nCaliff called the latest closure an “unfortunate setback and a reminder that natural weather events can also cause unforeseen supply chain disruptions.”\n\nWorking ‘night and day’ on formula supply\n\nAbbott said Wednesday that it has “ample existing supply of EleCare and most of its specialty and metabolic formulas” to meet the need until new products are available. Such products are being released to families through health care professionals.\n\nThere have also been moves to increase availability of other types of formula. President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to direct suppliers of formula ingredients to prioritize delivery to formula makers, and the administration launched Operation Fly Formula to import formula from abroad.\n\nCaliff said on Twitter on Wednesday that teams are working “night and day” to make formula available. He said Abbott has been exceeding the monthly quantity of formula produced in 2021 even while the Michigan facility was closed, and other producers are making formula at “higher-than-average rates.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“This means that the total amount of formula available, even before the Sturgis plant is back in production, exceeds the demand for formula prior to the recall,” Califf wrote.\n\nBut many grocery store shelves remain bare. About a quarter of infant formula products were still out of stock in the United States last week, according to data from market research firm Information Resources Incorporated, or IRI.\n\nIRI data is often cited by the White House as a measure of the severity of the shortage. The latest data shows that about 24% of infant formula products were out of stock during the week ending June 12, up from about 22% the week before.\n\nBefore a nationwide infant formula recall by Abbott in February, about 10% of infant formula products were typically out of stock.", "authors": ["Jamie Gumbrecht"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/health/seasonal-food-produce-lbg-wellness/index.html", "title": "Eating seasonally and locally could benefit the environment | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\n“Eat with the seasons” has long been the rallying cry of local growers and their supporters. It’s a message that’s easy to embrace.\n\nThe taste and nutritional value of a hothouse tomato from the supermarket’s year-round stock is no match for that of one ripened by the sun in a community garden. You’ll get far more berries for the buck harvesting them yourself at a U-Pick farm than buying those packed in half-pint plastic containers and air-freighted from thousands of miles away. And patronizing our neighborhood farm markets gives us the good feeling of getting to know our sustainably minded producers and their earth-friendly practices while investing in the local economy.\n\nBut are personal food choices such as these doing much, if anything, to heal our ailing planet?\n\nThe answer in complicated, and it depends on the food in question. A United Nations-backed study from 2021 shows that the way we produce, process and package food accounts for more than one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity. A 2019 report by the EAT-Lancet Commission, a team of leading scientists across the globe, further warned that without drastically changing our food consumption habits, we won’t be able to meet the nutritional needs of a growing world population without irreversible environmental damage.\n\nAnd a new study exploring the carbon footprint (greenhouse gas emissions) of Americans’ evolving eating patterns assures us that our efforts to shop and eat better aren’t in vain. Some foods impact the environment in drastically different ways. Animal products and heavily processed and packaged foods, for example, typically require considerably more energy to produce than the homegrown and handmade foods at local farmers’ markets. Five commodities are responsible for more than 75% of the U.S. diet’s carbon footprint, according to study: beef, milk and dairy, pork, chicken and eggs. And more than half of those greenhouse gases can be attributed to beef.\n\n“The good news,” said Clare Bassi, the study’s co-author, is “diet changes are happening.” According to her study, over a 15-year period, US beef consumption fell by 30%, while collective changes in eating habits across all demographics led to a 35% decline in greenhouse gas emissions. That’s roughly equivalent to taking every single passenger vehicle off the road for nearly two years, she said in an email.\n\nThe study calculated greenhouse gas emissions based on individual daily diets reported by more than 39,000 US adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2003 and 2018. Bassi looked at how the averages changed over time and examined trends based on demographic factors, such as sex, age, household income, and race/ethnicity. The study was published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.\n\nOther studies, Bassi added, have shown that more than half of Americans are willing to eat more plant-based meat alternatives, and it’s predicted that the global market for plant-based protein sources may increase five-fold by 2030.\n\nGoing the distance\n\nA common claim among local food advocates is that reducing our “food miles” — the distance our food travels from farm to plate — can also help fight climate change. Some groups have even advocated labeling to indicate a product’s mileage to its destination.\n\nThat might make sense intuitively, but in a 2020 report, Hannah Ritchie, the head of research at Our World in Data, calls that “one of the most misguided pieces of advice.”\n\nLand use and farm-stage emissions, including the application of fertilizers and production of methane in the stomachs of cattle, account for more than 80% of the footprint for most foods.\n\nTransport is responsible for less than 10% of their final carbon impact; for beef it’s less than 1%. The remainder of a food’s emissions mostly occur during processing, packaging, and retail.\n\n“Eating locally would only have a significant impact if transport was responsible for a large share of food’s final carbon footprint,” Ritchie wrote in the report. “For most foods, this is not the case.”\n\nShe does, however, note one exception where seasonality and geography do make a difference: products which travel by air. Most foods are transported by boat, which generate far fewer emissions. Air-freight is generally reserved for highly perishable foods where speed of delivery is essential, such as blueberries or green beans. So it’s probably a safe bet that those fragile fruits and vegetables at the farmstand will be a more climate friendly choice than their out-of-season mass-produced counterparts.\n\nPractical solution: What you eat\n\nAs with recycling, trying to offer one-size-fits-all solutions is tricky — and sometimes even counterproductive.\n\nScientists and activists tell us that no amount of individual action will be sufficient to halt the catastrophic impacts on the climate. Global policies holding industry accountable for its role in the crisis, they stress, are essential for addressing the magnitude of the problem.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean consumers are powerless beyond pressuring their lawmakers. “Small changes at home really can make a significant positive impact,” Bassi said.\n\nBy far, the more significant thing we can do at the dining table to mitigate climate change, she said, is to eat less meat and dairy, and incorporate a variety of healthy plant-based alternatives into our diets: fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts.\n\nWhile eating less meat is one of the more quantifiable actions we can take, other actions add up as well.\n\n“Sourcing locally can be one driver for impact reduction,” Bassi said. “But it’s often a small or highly variable lever for change.” She and other experts stress that it’s important for consumers to understand that what we eat, rather than where it originated and how it gets to us, matters most when it comes to trying to shrink our own carbon footprint.\n\n“Most consumers don’t want to invest tons of time untangling these simultaneous equations in their heads in making their food purchases,” said Roni Neff, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and program director at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. Nor should they.\n\nMaking these dietary shifts needn’t be difficult, Neff said. “If the goal is greenhouse reduction, weighing the differences between this apple and that apple is less important than just knowing it’s an apple,” she said. “Think about the bottom of the food chain you learned about in elementary school: plants and seafood that are eating plants.”\n\nPractical solution: Reducing food waste\n\nAnother practical way for individuals to take control of their carbon footprint is reducing food waste.\n\nFarmers have to grow far more food than we actually need, because some 30 to 40% of what they produce gets tossed, according to the United Natural Resources Defense Council. That comes at a huge cost in greenhouse gases, Neff said. Plus it wastes land, water, labor, energy and other valuable resources.\n\nIn this regard, she pointed out, controlling our portion sizes matters not only to our waistlines, but the planet. “It’s easy to buy more than we can realistically eat, especially when we’re shopping at a farmer’s market when everything’s fresh and beautiful and we just want to try it all and buy it all,” she said.\n\nTurning food scraps into nutrient-rich compost can combat food waste while helping your garden grow. Neff also suggested getting creative with leftovers, following guidelines for freezing your excess, and setting a special bin in the front of the fridge for things that need to be consumed more quickly.\n\n“A really useful way to come up with solutions is write down everything your household actually eats for a week,” Neff suggested. “Get in the habit of communicating with family members to coordinate schedules so you’ll know who will be around for meals.”\n\nPractical solution: Variety\n\nScientists tell us that a vast diversity of plant and animal life, from microbes in the soil to large predators such as bears and wolves, is essential for maintaining a balanced and healthy ecosystem. Monoculture, the practice of growing single species with identical genes in the same field, is responsible for much of the uniform produce available to us year-round in supermarkets. While these methods have the advantages of yielding huge volumes cheaply and consistently, they also destroy that biological diversity needed for long-term sustenance.\n\n“We’ve lost a lot of our biodiversity in our food supply and narrowed in on a few varieties of fruits and vegetables that we like and know and keep going back to,” Neff said. “A farmers’ market is a great place to sample and try lots of things you haven’t tried. You could be the first on your block to try a new variety of peach they’ve never ever heard of, and who knows — that peach could turn out to be more resistant to drought or a pest than the more common ones on the supermarket shelf.”\n\nFrom peaches and tomatoes in summer to citrus and kale and winter, nature is our best teacher in helping us add variety to our meals, which is good for our diet as well as the planet.\n\nThe Seasonal Food Guide is a comprehensive national database with a downloadable app of seasonal food (vegetables, herbs, legumes, nuts) available in each state throughout the year, based on data from the National Resources Defense Council and state departments of agriculture and university extension programs throughout the US.

They’re counting on updated boosters to restore waning immunity against Covid-19. With influenza expected back in the US this fall, flu shots could be critical to prevent severe illness and keep hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.\n\nWhile the federal government will facilitate getting these inoculations to states, it will be the 2,820 state and local health departments that will spearhead the work of getting shots into arms, and public health experts say it’s not clear that these offices have enough funding or staff to get the job done.\n\n“I think it’s deeply worrisome,” said Dr. Peggy Hamburg, former health commissioner for New York City and former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration. “It’s hard to imagine how state and local health departments can all mobilize, and they desperately do need additional support.”\n\n“I think we have to recognize that this is a very vulnerable time,” said Hamburg, who recently chaired a commission for the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund on how to modernize the nation’s public health system.\n\nAfter almost three years of contending with vaccine hesitancy, politics and a global pandemic, the nation’s public health workers are frayed and leaving their posts. More than 1 in 4 health department leaders quit their jobs during the pandemic, some after harassment and death threats. Studies are underway to measure how deeply those losses extended to their staff.\n\nNow, these depleted agencies are being asked to tackle new threats like monkeypox without additional funding to handle them.\n\n‘Overwhelmed is an understatement’\n\nCan these agencies pull it off?\n\n“Probably not,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in an email to CNN. “Public health is chronically underfunded and understaffed. Substantial capacity was built during the COVID-19 response – for example, contact tracing teams – but many jurisdictions have wound down that infrastructure. Covid money is largely inflexible, so it can’t really be used for other threats like monkeypox.”\n\nThe nation’s vaccinators say they are struggling.\n\n“Overwhelmed is an understatement,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.\n\nHannan said her members have not received any funding to carry out a vaccination campaign against monkeypox. Yet they’ve just been asked the change how the vaccine is given, switching from a more familiar under-the-skin injection to a shallower method that squirts the vaccine between skin layers, something that requires training to do correctly. The hope is that intradermal shots, which require one-fifth of a regular dose, can quickly increase supplies of this hard-to-get vaccine.\n\nAs a result, immunization managers are scrambling to find money and staff to order vaccines, manually track inventory, transport shots to the locations where they’re needed, train providers, and collect and send data back to federal health agencies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOn top of that, ordering has started for updated boosters to protect against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron strain of the new coronavirus, which have been promised to Americans by mid-September.\n\nAllotments in these early orders have been smaller than anticipated, Hannan said, which is forcing city and state health officials to develop plans for who should be first in line to get them, should demand initially outstrip supply.\n\nAdditionally, many cities are currently testing their sewage for poliovirus after it was detected recently in Rockland County, New York, and New York City. If additional community spread is suspected, those areas may need to mount vaccination campaigns to protect residents who haven’t had the shot, such as recent immigrants or young children who missed routine immunizations during the pandemic.\n\nChildren typically get four doses of the polio vaccine by the time they’re six years of age in the US, but many kids have fallen behind on their shots. Globally, the pandemic led to the largest backslide in childhood vaccination rates in 30 years, according to the World Health Organization. Health officials fear the erosion of this coverage has set the stage for the return of other infectious diseases, like measles.\n\n“A break or a gap in delivery of vaccines sets us up for further outbreaks,” said Dr. Davidson Hamer, an infectious disease specialist at Boston University.\n\nDistrust fuels hostility and hesitancy\n\nVaccines are considered one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine, second only to clean water as a cost-effective health intervention. Each year, they prevent millions of deaths around the world. In their first year of use, the Covid-19 vaccines prevented nearly 20 million deaths, a recent study found.\n\nYet vaccine hesitancy has increased, fueled by misinformation on social media. While more than three-quarters of Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19, 19% say they definitely won’t get a Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nIf all these challenges weren’t enough, annual flu shots are due to roll out soon, and they could be especially important this fall.\n\nInfluenza made a comeback in Australia this year for the first time since the pandemic began. United States health officials watch Australia’s flu season closely for clues about what could happen here. They’re anticipating that we could see more flu transmission this year than we have for the past two years, and flu vaccinations will be key to preventing hospitalizations and deaths.\n\n“I think right now we have a perfect storm in the vaccine world happening in this country,” said Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n\nHe points out that even though average daily Covid-19 deaths are much lower than they were in 2020 and 2021, the US is still averaging more than 400 a day, making it the nation’s fourth leading cause of death. Most of those deaths are in unvaccinated people, according to the CDC.\n\nOverall, more than 1 in 5 Americans are still unvaccinated against Covid-19, and that number doesn’t seem likely to budge. Vaccination rates are mostly stagnant.\n\nIt would take a more robust public health workforce, and a better funded one, to rebuild confidence in vaccines.\n\nA recent study by The de Beaumont Foundation, a nonprofit that works to strengthen public health, found the public health system needs 80,000 more full-time staff – a whopping 80% increase over current staffing levels – to provide basic community services, like monitoring and controlling the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBrian Castrucci, president and CEO of that organization, says America won’t be able to restore its public health workforce until people value and respect the work they do.\n\n“What we’ve seen during Covid is a fringe anti-vax movement move more mainstream, endangering our nation’s safety, security and economic prosperity,” Castrucci said. “It’s going to be harder and harder to vaccinate.”\n\n“We are privileged as a society that we haven’t seen children in with crutches from polio. No one’s in an iron lung.

But they’ve been 80% full at only one other point: in January, during the height of the Omicron surge in the US. Back in January, about a quarter of hospital beds were in use for Covid-19 patients. But now, only about 6% of beds are in use for Covid-19 patients, according to the HHS data.\n\nThe broader respiratory virus season is in full swing across the US. All but six states are experiencing “high” or “very high” respiratory virus as seasonal flu activity remains “high and continues to increase,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe number of people admitted to the hospital for flu during the week of Thanksgiving was nearly double the number of admissions during the week before. And the latest surveillance data probably does not reflect the full effects of holiday gatherings, as it captures only through November 26, two days past Thanksgiving.\n\nNancy Foster, vice president for quality and patient safety with the American Hospital Association, says that an influx of flu patients is a key reason why hospitals are filling up. On top of that are challenges brought on by work force shortages and a backlog of patients who delayed care over the past few years.\n\n“The rates are higher because we are seeing patients with the flu in many parts of the country and that has brought a lot of older adults and some young children into the hospitals. Additionally, RSV is filling pediatric beds and cribs along with patients who are sicker now due to putting off care during Covid-19, which has required more intensive and complex care,” she said in a statement to CNN on Friday.\n\n“Workforce shortages have not only made it more challenging for hospitals, but also have diminished the number of patients who can be cared for in nursing homes and other post acute care settings. Thus, patients are spending more time in hospitals, awaiting discharge to the next level of care and limiting our ability to make a bed available to a patient who truly needs to be hospitalized.”\n\nIn a letter to the nation’s governors last week, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra noted that flu and other respiratory viruses are “increasing strain” on the country’s health care systems.

A transport official said the flight requested to return shortly after takeoff from Jakarta. Weather conditions were normal but the brand new aircraft had experienced a technical issue on its previous flight.\n\nLion Air said the jet, on a 1 hour and 10 minute flight to Pangkal Pinang on an island chain off Sumatra, was carrying 181 passengers, including one child and two babies, and eight crew members.\n\nDistraught friends and relatives prayed and hugged each other as they waited at Pangkal Pinang's airport and at a crisis center set up at Jakarta's airport. Indonesian TV broadcast pictures of a fuel slick and debris field in the ocean.\n\nThe National Search and Rescue Agency's deputy chief, Nugroho Budi Wiryanto, said about 300 people including soldiers, police and local fishermen were involved in the search and that so far it has recovered no bodies - only ID cards, personal belongings and aircraft debris.\n\n\"We are waiting for the miracle from God,\" said Wiryanto, when asked if there were any hope of survivors.\n\nAt the agency's headquarters in Jakarta, family members waited desperately for news.\n\nFeni, who uses a single name, said her soon to be married sister was on the flight, planning to meet relatives in Pangkal Pinang.\n\n\"We are here to find any information about my younger sister, her fiance, her in-law to be and a friend of them,\" said Feni.\n\n\"We don't have any information,\" she said, as her father wiped tears from reddened eyes. \"No one provided us with any information that we need. We're confused. We hope that our family is still alive.\"\n\nIndonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani also arrived at the agency and met with its chief, seeking information about 20 ministry staff who were on the flight after attending a ministry event in Jakarta.\n\nThe search and rescue agency said the flight ended in waters off West Java that are 30 to 35 meters (98 to 115 feet) deep.\n\nThe agency's chief, Muhammad Syaugi, told a news conference that divers are trying to locate the wreckage.\n\nWeather conditions for the flight were safe, according to the Indonesian meteorology agency. It said the type of clouds associated with turbulence was not present and winds were weak.\n\nThe Boeing 737 Max 8 was delivered to Lion Air in mid-August and put in use within days, according to aviation website Flightradar24. Malindo Air, a Malaysian subsidiary of Jakarta-based Lion Air, was the first airline to being using the 737 Max 8 last year. The Max 8 replaced the similar 800 in the Chicago-based plane maker's product line.\n\nLion Air president-director Edward Sirait said the plane had a \"technical problem\" on its previous flight from Bali to Jakarta but it had been fully remedied. He didn't know specifics of the problem when asked in a TV interview. The pilot of Flight 610 had more than 6,000 flying hours while the co-pilot had more than 5,000 hours, according to the airline.\n\n\"Indeed there were reports about a technical problem, and the technical problem has been resolved in accordance with the procedures released by the plane manufacturer,\" he said. \"I did not know exactly but let it be investigated by the authorities.\"\n\nBoeing Co. said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the crash and was prepared to provide technical assistance to Indonesia's crash probe.\n\nIn a statement, the Chicago-based manufacturer expressed its concern for the 189 people onboard and offered \"heartfelt sympathies to their families and loved ones.\"\n\nThe Transport Ministry said the plane took off from Jakarta at about 6:20 a.m. and crashed just 13 minutes later. Data from FlightAware showed it had reached an altitude of only 5,200 feet (1,580 meters).\n\nThe crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since an AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea in December 2014, killing all 162 on board.\n\nIndonesian airlines were barred in 2007 from flying to Europe because of safety concerns, though several were allowed to resume services in the following decade. The ban was completely lifted in June this year. The U.S. lifted a decadelong ban in 2016.\n\nLion Air, a discount carrier, is one of Indonesia's youngest and biggest airlines, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations.\n\nIn 2013, one of its Boeing 737-800 jets missed the runway while landing on Bali, crashing into the sea without causing any fatalities among the 108 people on board.\n\n__\n\nWright reported from Jakarta.

Young International Airport as Mayor Mike Duggan's team raised the idea of closing the airfield permanently.\n\nThe rejection of the offer from Avflight, the fixed-base operator at the east-side airfield still best known as Detroit City Airport, came amid complaints from airport advocates that the city is needlessly letting a potential asset deteriorate.\n\nAmong other signs of neglect, the city hasn't staffed a Detroit Fire Department station on airport grounds for many years, which prevents some business aircraft from landing there because of insurance concerns. Nor has the city applied for a variety of multimillion-dollar federal and state grants that could help pay for needed upgrades to runways.\n\nThe airport doesn't even have its own website, and the city does little or no marketing of the airfield.\n\nCarl Muhs, president of Avflight, an Ann Arbor-based firm that operates multiple airports in the U.S. and Britain, said he offered in 2016 to spend up to $4 million at City Airport to build a new terminal and hangars to accommodate larger corporate jets, but only if the city granted Avflight the security of a multiyear lease.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe city for many years had not offered leases to tenant firms at the airport, keeping them on month-to-month status that could be revoked at any time.\n\n“We had been working on a lease for quite a while and then got to the very end where it was due to be signed and it was pulled off the table,” Muhs said. “(The city) said, ‘We’re going to take another look at the airport and decide what direction we want to go in.’ So we’ve been on hold for quite a while out there.\"\n\nSuch moves fuel concerns for the airport's future. For against the hope and promise of a revitalized City Airport stands the allure of freeing up the airfield’s 264 acres for other uses, such as an industrial park, which Duggan has suggested might bring many more jobs to the city.\n\nThat possibility is now under study, and Duggan's team maintains that until a formal decision on the site's future is made, it made no sense to move ahead with the Avflight offer or other improvements.\n\nJed Howbert, Duggan’s group executive for Planning, Housing and Development, said the administration at this point is trying to gather facts for further discussion.\n\n“It’s a big assembled piece of property in a city that doesn’t have a lot of them,” Howbert said in an interview. “The basic question we’re asking is, 'how do you maximize the benefit of the airport to the people of Detroit?' ”\n\nHowbert said there are several options, including spending money to restore the airport in whole or part; closing the shorter of the airport’s two runways and using that land for other economic development; and closing the airport altogether and redeveloping the land.\n\n“We want to get to a point where we have a common fact-based discussion on how those various scenarios compare to each other in terms of jobs, other benefits to the city, neighborhood impact, cost to execute them,” Howbert said. “It should be something you can summarize on one sheet of paper and then go talk about them.”\n\nBut Howbert sounded skeptical of the airport’s future.\n\n“The reality is that it loses money, there’s not many jobs on-site, and it’s not very actively used by planes that are based there,\" he said. \"So it’s hard to make an argument that, as an asset today, that’s it’s delivering commensurate with what it should be, given how much land it is in the city.”\n\nBecause of City Airport’s problems, flight operations have steadily declined in recent years, from 45,233 takeoffs and landings in 2014 to 37,264 last year, Federal Aviation Administration data reports show.\n\nThe city says the airport loses about $1 million a year, though about half of that loss stems from a water drainage fee that the city charges. Advocates for the airport point out that many types of public infrastructure lose money but deliver broader economic benefits.\n\nFederal complications\n\nYet given how difficult it is to actually close an airport — the Federal Aviation Authority can take years, if not decades, to approve a closure — advocates say the city ought to move ahead with a vigorous airport revitalization plan now.\n\nAmong others, the Detroit City Council has expressed its support for revitalizing the airport many times in recent years.\n\n\"I can say that I have made it clear I DO NOT SUPPORT CLOSING THE AIRPORT!!!,\" Council Member Scott Benson told the Free Press in an e-mail. \"I will also continue to advocate for investment in this City asset, as it can and will become a huge economic development engine for the City and region once we (the City) start to make even the basic investments to keep it in a state of good repair.\"\n\nThe nonprofit Coleman A. Young International Airport Education Association, consisting of community advocates, corporate executives, recreational flyers and other fans of the airport, believes significant new business for City Airport is just waiting on some signal from Duggan’s team that the city will prioritize airport revitalization.\n\n“The thing is, we know we are 100% certain that at the end of the day this airport will be saved because there will not be a better choice,” said Dave Tarrant, the group's executive director. “We just have to get the political forces to reach that conclusion.”\n\nThe airport was a pioneer in big-city airfields when it opened in 1927, and it remained thronged with commercial airline passengers as recently as about 20 years ago. But today it remains badly underused, its landscape dotted with derelict structures.\n\nIts main hangars date to the 1940s and remain too small to house today’s largest corporate jets. Of about 130 smaller so-called T-hangers — garage-like structures that house small private aircraft — fewer than half are in use and dozens have fallen into such disrepair as to be unusable.\n\nNeeded maintenance has been neglected for years. At one spot on the perimeter of the airfield, a broken-down airplane has settled in place for so many years that trees have grown up within inches of it. The airport’s two runways remain in active use but are overdue for maintenance work.\n\nQuick fixes available\n\nAdvocates of revitalizing City Airport point to low-cost fixes that could almost instantly unlock the airport's hidden value. Some of the most helpful of the changes would cost the city almost nothing. One is to offer long-term leases to airport tenants who rent hangars and other facilities.\n\nLonger leases: Detroit refuses to give any of the private firms operating at the airport anything but month-to-month status. Firms like Avflight, which fuels planes, cuts grass, plows snow and does other operational chores, say they are willing to pump new investment into facilities but cannot as long as the city denies them the stability of a long-term lease.\n\nAir Eagle, a firm that operates two business-class planes from the airport, also expresses frustration over the city's lack of willingness to consider longer leases. Michael Zabkiewicz, general manager and chief pilot of Air Eagle, said it’s not possible to risk spending millions of dollars on facilities that they could be told to vacate on short notice.\n\n“You know, it’s to the point now where it’s almost a joke,” Zabkiewicz said. “There’s no point to even bother to ask because we already know what the answer is going to be. … It’s one of those things where, why put the effort into something that will never happen?”\n\nBy comparison, the Jackson County Airport in Jackson grants firms up to 40-year leases at the airport, as well as the right to sublease their space.\n\n“You just have to make yourself attractive to people,” said Kent Maurer, the airport manager there.\n\nDetroit’s City Council passed a resolution earlier this year asking the Duggan administration to consider granting longer term leases to operators like Avflight and Air Eagle. So far, the administration hasn’t done so.\n\nTarrant of the nonprofit airport educational association said the lack of longer term leases reflects the city's lack of commitment to the airport's future.\n\n“Just by telling the world it’s open for business and will be sustained, by itself, plus the long-term leases, those two acts would turn everything around right now,” Tarrant said. “It’s just management will and commitment. That’s what’s so frustrating about this. We know how to fix it, it can be fixed, the resources are there to fix it. It’s just management will and commitment.”\n\nFederal grants: The highest cost estimate for revitalizing the airport is $83 million for restoring commercial airline service — the price tag for upgrading runways, building new terminal and parking facilities and other improvements. But even if the city went that far, almost none of that cost would be borne by the City of Detroit itself.\n\nThe FAA, as part of its role in maintaining a national airport network, would pay most of the cost through grants. The State of Michigan would pay part of the remainder.\n\nThe Jackson County Airport last year completed rebuilding its runways for $49 million. But the federal government paid $39 million of that and Michigan paid another $2.6 million. Of the roughly $7.7 million Jackson County had to contribute, almost all of that went to relocate a landfill to make room for the new runway.\n\nDuggan’s office recently released a report from an aviation consultant called GRA Inc., based near Philadelphia, on the likely cost of revitalizing City Airport. Even that GRA report noted that almost all the cost of upgrades would be borne by federal or state agencies.\n\nOne scenario outlined in the GRA report looked at spending up to $50 million on new facilities; it estimated that Detroit would have to cover just $2.8 million of that.\n\nThe FAA and state grants are competitive and not always awarded when first applied for. But Mauer of the Jackson Airport said that good plans will be funded eventually. Detroit has not aggressively pursued such grants for City Airport, angering supporters.\n\nMarketing: City Airport doesn’t even have its own website, nor does the city market the airport as a gateway.\n\nBy contrast, the Jackson County Airport operates a website that offers a wealth of easy-to-find information, including phone numbers and e-mails for airport personnel, consumer tips about car rentals, technical data for pilots such as radio frequencies in use by the airport, postings of job openings, photographs of award winners and volunteers, calendar of events, financial information and more.\n\nMaurer said Jackson County leaders understand the value of the airport near the city’s center and support it.\n\n“They’re not building any new airports almost anywhere, and if you’re going to build them you’re not going to build them anywhere close to a populated area,” he said.\n\nMuhs of the Avflight operation echoed that.\n\n“Years ago, train stations were the front door to a community. Now, it’s airports,” he said. And in the future, as drone delivery and other airborne mobility options flourish, “it’s going to be that much more important that those airports exist.”\n\nAnother possible model is Lunken Field in Cincinnati, which, like City Airport, first operated in the 1920s and for many years served as Cincinnati's main airport. Today, commercial airline traffic flies from the much larger Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, but private and corporate aircraft still use Lunken.\n\nIn 2009, the Ultimate Air Shuttle began flying from Lunken with a flight to Chicago's Midway Airport, and has since added shuttle flights to New York, Charlotte and Cleveland.\n\nFirefighting and education\n\nThe Detroit Fire Department used to operate a small station on airport grounds with two trucks to deal with runway crashes. But the city pulled firefighters out of that station many years ago, electing to depend on fire equipment coming from nearby stations in case of a runway emergency.\n\nBut that arrangement has more than safety implications. Some business fliers who may otherwise use City Airport are prevented from doing so by their insurers, who insist the planes be based at a field with on-site fire and rescue protection.\n\n“The guys with the big corporate planes, they may want to land there, but they’re not allowed to,” said Keith Newell, director of business planning for the Coleman A. Young International Airport Educational Association.\n\nDeputy Fire Commissioner Dave Fornell said plans are under way to restaff the station on airport grounds later this year, but only for an eight-hour shift each day. Even now, he said, adequate protection is provided by the off-site fire units based at the nearby Fire Academy.\n\nBut Michael Nevin, president of the Detroit Fire Fighters Association, said an eight-hour shift doesn’t go nearly far enough to ensure safety at an airport that could be used around the clock.\n\n\"That place should be manned 24/7,\" he said. \"It ridiculous that they closed it. But now that we're seeing a spike in air traffic and the city coming back, they need to reinvest in that fire house and train people and reboot the airport division.\"\n\nFrom the 1940s until 2013, Detroit Public Schools operated the Benjamin Davis Aerospace Technical High School immediately adjacent to the airport. Training courses at the school once gave graduating seniors an FAA certificate as an aircraft technician — a ticket to a high-paying career.\n\nBut DPS abandoned the school in 2013, transferring classes to the Golightly Career and Technical Center off East Jefferson Avenue on the far east side. In the process of transferring classes, DPS lost much of the equipment and material needed for the curriculum. Unable to offer the FAA-required courses, the school voluntarily surrendered its FAA certificate in 2014.\n\nLawrence Millben, the first African-American youth to graduate from the high school and a retired colonel in the Air Force, is among many who want to see the school returned to its former site adjacent to the airport and FAA certification to train technicians returned.\n\n\"We are working diligently to get it back to the airport,\" he said. \"Kids coming out of Davis Aerospace (could) come out with an FAA certification that would allow them to make $80,000 a year to start. Why are we taking that away from the kids of Detroit when we know we can make them productive, tax-paying citizens? Skills in that area are nationally needed.\"\n\nPrivate-public partnership?\n\nPerhaps the biggest potential change would come if Duggan spins off direct control of the airport from the city’s small Department of Aviation to a nonprofit public authority or conservancy. In similar ways, Cobo Center, Eastern Market and other entities owned by the city are now operated by nonprofit boards and professional management.\n\nSuch spin-offs often prove controversial, such as the state’s takeover of Belle Isle during the city’s bankruptcy period. But they often prove effective.\n\nThe once-failing Cobo, Eastern Market and other spin-offs saw immediate improvements once they were put into new management structures. Cobo, owned by the city but run since 2009 by a regional authority, completed a nearly $300-million expansion and upgrade that thoroughly updated the aging facility.\n\nAnd Eastern Market likewise pumped millions of philanthropic dollars into renovating its market sheds and added a host of new vendors and programs once spun off from direct city control in 2006. Even Belle Isle, now operated as a state park, showed marked improvements in maintenance and recreational offerings under its new management.\n\nSuch public authorities offer access to funding sources unavailable to the city itself. And management devoted solely to that one operation can often focus attention and efforts, not get lost in the larger municipal bureaucracy.\n\nDuggan has spoken against such spin-offs, arguing that he cannot control outcomes without having direct control of a function. But numerous airports in the U.S., including Detroit Metro and Jackson County Airport, are managed by some type of airport authority. Many advocates for City Airport said a new management structure is needed to turn around the airport’s declining fortunes.\n\nJob opportunities?\n\nWhen Duggan’s staffers talk about possibly closing the airport, they cite the recent success of the city’s I-94 Industrial Park. That roughly 200-acre site, a former east-side residential neighborhood cleared out in the 1990s, recently filled up with new industrial users, including the Flex-N-Gate auto supplier, which is bringing hundreds of jobs to the city. Duggan’s team believes City Airport land would find new users quickly.\n\n“If we can deliver large site-ready sites that have infrastructure, there’s been proven demand over the last couple of years to build that, and the jobs numbers are pretty attractive,” Howbert said.\n\nAgainst that possibility lies the value that a revitalized City Airport might bring. As Detroit’s comeback plans advance and as downtown grows as a hub serving the corporate, sports and entertainment fields, an airfield just minutes away could prove valuable.\n\nCorporate executives like John Nicholson, son of PVS Chemicals President and CEO James Nicholson, supports revitalizing the airport.\n\n“We feel like it’s an underutilized asset with such potential being 6 miles from downtown,” he said. “It’d just be a shame to see it disappear and turn into factory sites when it has such potential.”\n\nAnd the airport already looms large for Macomb County and other east-side communities. Muhs of the Avflight fixed-base operation said at least a quarter of the air traffic using City Airport today carries business travelers heading to Warren for the General Motors Tech Center or the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, or TACOM.\n\nWithout City Airport, those business travelers would have to use another airport more distant.\n\nIf Duggan were to declare his intention to keep the airport open and restore it, that “would be the best thing we could hear,” Muhs said.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIf Duggan and his team do decide to close the airport and convert the 260 acres to an industrial park, they may find that easier said than done. The federal government, through the FAA, takes years to study potential airport closings and is reluctant to approve them. Each airfield represents a link in the nationwide network of safety, and, once gone, often cannot be replaced.\n\nThe FAA recently agreed to close the Santa Monica, Calif., airport in 2028 — but only after about 30 years of debate and discord. In 1994, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley announced he would close the lakefront Meigs Field downtown; almost 10 years later, Daley, frustrated by seemingly endless delays, ordered city crews to destroy the runway by bulldozing large gouges in it in the middle of the night.\n\nDuggan aide Howbert said he expects to have the next phase of the fact-finding report done by fall, with a discussion to follow.\n\n“We’ll look at any good idea that maximizes the benefit to Detroiters,” he said. “Airports get handled in a whole lot of different ways in other cities and states. If someone has a great idea that unlocks one of these scenarios, we are absolutely going to look at and listen to that idea.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story about water department drainage fees at City Airport was incorrect.

Amber Jones, assistant store leader at the Kwik Star truck stop in Story City, said she’s seen a steady stream of customers looking for milk, eggs, butter and other staples. But she said traffic in the store has slowed since the storm began Thursday.\n\nThe station will stay open through the holidays, said Jones, who had to drive through a few drifts to make it to work.\n\n“I’ve seen worse,” she said.\n\nDeep freeze leaves downtown Des Moines landmark dry\n\nAfter taking a toll on Iowa's roads and airline schedules, the sub-zero cold also is making trouble for a major downtown Des Moines office complex. Building management on Friday advised tenants of Capital Square, including the Des Moines Register, that water mains on two sides of the building had burst because of the cold. It said it was working on repairs with the city and contractors.\n\nThe building on the west side of Cowles Commons is known for its dramatic atrium, which has hosted many festivals and other events. At 486,755 square feet, Capital Square is the third-largest multi-tenant office building in the central business district, behind 801 Grand and the Ruan Center.\n\nAs officer hit, Clive joins chorus to stay home\n\nThe Clive Police Department has joined the growing number of law enforcement agencies calling for drivers to stay off the roads after one of its patrol vehicles was crumpled while on what the department described in a Facebook posting as the Interstate 35/80 “ice rink.” The driver of the car that collided with police vehicle was going too fast for the slippery conditions, the post said.\n\n“Our best advice is to stay home, enjoy the day and have a nice hot cup of coffee while binge-watching your favorite streaming service,” the post said.\n\nThe officer was not injured, but the department said the vehicle is probably a total loss.\n\nReynolds eases restrictions to speed heating fuel deliveries\n\nIn a measure that's been fairly routine during periods of extended low temperatures, Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a proclamation to ease restrictions on transport of and access to heating fuel. Effective through Jan. 1, the proclamation suspends the regulatory provisions of Iowa Code pertaining to hours of service for crews and drivers delivering propane, diesel, natural gas, and other fuels used for residential, agricultural, and commercial heating for the duration of the blizzard.\n\nDes Moines airport chief sees flight disruptions dying down\n\nKevin Foley, executive director of Des Moines International Airport, said that when he woke up Friday morning, he saw that 10 departing flights and eight arrivals had been canceled. But since then, there have been no additional cancellations, he said.\n\n\"We do have cancellations. People should check the website, the airline website if they want to know if their flight is delayed or canceled,\" Foley said. \"The weather is obviously causing some havoc as far as the airline operations are concerned.\"\n\nFoley also acknowledged that plows are still clearing the runways of wind-driven drifts. \"But both runways are open and the airport is ... fully operational,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead, he is cautiously optimistic that the disruptions will abate before the holiday travel period ends.\n\n\"The weather is supposed to improve,\" he said. \"I believe we're supposed to get up to maybe 14 (degrees) tomorrow and the wind is supposed to die down. And so as this moves to the east and moves on out of the United States, we would hope travel would improve.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he said he has a reminder for airport users.\n\n\"We do have heated bus shelters,\" he said. \"If you're in one of the remote lots, we don't want people standing outside.\"\n\nIowa State Patrol: Despite improving weather, Iowa roads still hazardous\n\nWhile the decision by the National Weather Service to downgrade its blizzard warning in parts of Iowa is welcome news, Iowa State Patrol spokesperson Sgt. Alex Dinkla said Friday that driving conditions across the state remain treacherous.\n\n\"The entire NW third of Iowa is still 'travel not advised' with some roads labeled 'impassable.' We continue to see tow bans across our state,\" Dinkla said. \"The Iowa State Patrol is still urging drivers to stay off the roads as much as possible. Tomorrow, weather conditions will begin to improve and roads will be safer to travel on.\"\n\nNew figures Dinkla provided show the scope of the winter storm's disruption of holiday travel. From noon Wednesday to 5 a.m. Friday, troopers had received 788 calls for service and investigated 235 crashes, including 21 with injuries. There had been no deaths. Troopers also assisted 553 motorists.\n\nDes Moines police spokesperson Sgt. Paul Parizek warns drivers to continue to exercise care, despite the improving conditions.\n\n\"We’re all happy to see any improvement in the weather, but the winds and extremely low temperatures can still create hazardous driving conditions,\" Parizek said. \"Driving too fast for the conditions was a significant contributing factor in most of the 92 crashes that DMPD responded to yesterday. Slow down, and give each other some extra space.\"\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation also advised against driving.\n\n\"We would still caution motorists to delay their travel if they can,\" said Andrea Henry, a spokesperson for the agency. \"There are still a lot of roads especially just north of the metro that are 'travel not advised,' and many of them that are completely covered as well. ... \"If travelers do want to travel, we ask them to make sure they slow down and drive the conditions and wear their seat belts and remove distractions, of course.\"\n\nNational Weather Service calls off blizzard warning for some Iowa counties\n\nIn a hopeful sign, the National Weather Service early Friday lowered the blizzard warning for some Iowa counties, including most of the Des Moines metro, though a wind chill warning and winter weather advisory still apply. In some other parts of Iowa, it reduced the blizzard warning to a winter storm warning. Much of the northern half of the state, however, remains under a blizzard warning.\n\nThe change represented a reversal from the previous forecast, when the weather service said conditions would likely worsen through Friday. In its forecast discussion, it said the change was made because of improvements in visibility. Blowing snow continues to cut visibility to a mile or less in the blizzard warning area, but in southwest counties, the weather service said, \"visibility has remained steady at 8 miles or better.\"\n\n\"To account for this improvement the southwest counties in the winter storm warming and blizzard warning have been converted to a winter weather advisory and wind chill warning,\" the weather service said.\n\nIt also said that \"towards Saturday morning\" the center of the storm \"should push far enough east that winds will diminish towards 30 mph across the area. This should reduce visibility concerns (from) blowing snow, which at this point should also start to compact and become less blowable in general. When this happens the winter storm warning and blizzard warning will expire, to be replaced by the wind chill warning.\"\n\nOnce wind chills rise above minus 30 degrees ― they were at minus 39 degrees early Friday in Des Moines, with 32 mph winds and 44 mph gusts ― when the wind chill warnings may begin to fold, the weather service said.\n\nIt cautioned that even then, however, temperatures will still be dangerously low, \"especially for anyone that becomes stranded in blizzard conditions.\"\n\nLooking farther ahead, the weather service calls for some light snow on Christmas night, amounting to less than an inch. It said they by Tuesday, temperatures will begin to climb back toward normal for the season.\n\nTroopers, police frantically busy as storm makes a mess of Iowa roads\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol's workload grew apace with the blizzard through the day Thursday as the storm caused dozens of accidents. According to figures provided by the state patrol, troopers from noon to 5 p.m. had investigated 137 accidents and assisted 261 motorists. Both figures were more than double those for the preceding 24 hours ― already a busy period.\n\nBecause of the extreme cold, the salt and other products the Iowa Department of Transportation and Iowa cities were using to help keep roads clear were largely ineffectual. S\n\n“One hundred percent all across Iowa we are seeing 100% snow- or ice-covered roads,” State patrol spokesperson Alex Dinkla said Thursday, adding that high winds blowing snow are limiting visibility and making the roads even more slick.\n\n“The tricky part about the road conditions that we are going to see today going through tomorrow is the blowing snow in different areas is going to create a glaze of ice over most of the roadways,” he said.\n\n“The overall message is if you do not need to travel, stay at home,\" he said. \"We don't want anyone to put themselves or others at risk.”\n\nDinkla also said the state of Iowa has issued a temporary ban on towing vehicles, which means any cars left stuck out on the roads or in ditches may not be cleared until Monday, when conditions are safer.\n\nDes Moines police also saw a huge rise in traffic-related problems. According to a police news release, they investigated a total of 38 crashes in the 14 hours from 4 p.m. Wednesday, when snowfall became a serious factor, to 6 a.m Thursday, when it began to taper off. In the subsequent eight hours ending at 2 p.m. Thursday, as wind-chilled temperatures plunged and roads turned icy, they investigated 48 crashes.\n\nIn addition, two Des Moines police cruisers were involved in crashes Thursday while being used for wreck investigations on Interstate 235, the release said. There were no injuries.\n\nSmall-town life goes on in western Iowa, despite blizzard\n\nFar from the storm's disruptions to airports, highways and city bustle, life went on pretty much as usual in the rural western Iowa town of Soldier, despite the cold and snow.\n\nLeonard Jensen had brought his 1978 International 1086 tractor into the hamlet of fewer than 150 people earlier in the week. He’ll use it to move snow from the Soldier Lutheran Church parking lot, and if others armed with snowblowers and plows haven’t beat him to it, he’ll clear driveways and alleys across the town.\n\nIt’s typical for residents to move from house to house, clearing driveways and sidewalks after a big storm, said Paul Coen.\n\n“They really take care of each other. And they take care of their pastor,” said Coen, a retired pastor who travels from Millard, a neighborhood in the Omaha, Nebraska, metro, to minister to the Soldier Lutheran Church and Faith Lutheran Church in Onawa.\n\nLike other rural towns, Soldier has lost a lot over the years as the population has aged and dwindled, including grocery stores and schools. But residents' willingness to watch over each other is still alive, says Patty Jensen, president of Soldier Lutheran Church’s council and Leonard Jensen’s wife.\n\n“We’re a little town, so we come together whenever there’s a need. Not just when there’s a winter storm,” she said.\n\nThat means putting together church potlucks, hosting Santa Claus, bagging 40 boxes of Christmas cookies and candies for area nursing home residents and others who are isolated, and making sure those who need a trip to the doctor have rides.\n\n“It’s just the way of our town,” Patty Jensen said.\n\nBlizzard expected to strengthen overnight\n\nAs Iowans shivered in the cold of a holiday-week blizzard, the onslaught from the monster storm was far from over.\n\nThough the National Weather Service said the wide-ranging system's leading edge was over Lake Michigan, the frigid air and heavy wind besetting Iowa was set to strengthen Thursday night and Friday, bringing blowing snow and dangerous wind chill across the state.\n\nThe weather service, in an advisory discussion posting, forecast an \"explosive deepening\" of the storm's low-pressure system Friday night.\n\n\"For Iowa, this means winds will be stronger tonight and Friday (than) they have been so far,\" the advisory said.\n\nIt said blowing snow already was cutting visibility to as little as a quarter mile in parts of the state.\n\n\"With these stronger winds continuing to loft snow, we continue to forecast blizzard conditions tonight into Friday ... . Those blizzard conditions will be most likely in rural, open areas so if you are in a sheltered, city/urban location and it doesn't look bad, do not be deceived.\"\n\nThe advisory said the strengthening wind will result in wind chills \"of -35F or lower across all of Iowa.\"\n\nWeakening of the system isn't expected until midday Saturday.\n\nEx-Iowa Dem Chair Troy Price says he's lucky to be home\n\nUntil Saturday afternoon, when the winds begin to abate, air travel is likely to be a hit-or-miss proposition. At Des Moines International Airport, delays mounted as every outgoing flight underwent a de-icing process. Several flights to Denver and the perpetually storm-plagued O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, both major connection points for flights from Iowa, were canceled as the day went on.\n\nFormer Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price, now working in New Hampshire, changed his flight home to Des Moines from Thursday to Wednesday so he would be assured of being able to spend the holiday with his husband.\n\nPrice felt lucky to have done so, even as he tweeted a photo of himself in a frozen ski mask as he shoveled Iowa snow.\n\n“I’m glad I did that,\" he said. \"Otherwise, I don’t think I would have made it home for the holidays.”\n\nNorwalk mom: We'll hunker down\n\nFor Iowa parents with children home on the long holiday school break, the threatening conditions outdoors make for a lot of family togetherness.\n\nJacy Rooney of Norwalk, making a shopping run to a southwest Des Moines Hy-Vee, said sending her kids out to play in the snow wasn't an option.\n\n\"It's just too cold,\" Rooney said, adding, \"We're going to hunker down, I think, for the weekend.\"\n\nAmes resident dons military Arctic gear to remove snow\n\nAmes resident Barry Romitti was out in his Air Force Arctic gear he used to wear when stationed in Fairbanks, Alaska, to blow snow Thursday morning as the National Weather Service was reporting a wind chill of minus 35 degrees.\n\n\"It's every bit as cold right now as it was when I was stationed up there in the absolute peak of the winter,\" Romitti said.\n\nRomitti said he and his neighbors often take turns blowing the snow in the neighborhood and this time he drew the short straw.\n\n\"Yes, I'll go do my neighbors’ if I have time, but today might be hard because of the wind chill. I don't think I could stay out that long,\" Romitti said.\n\nDes Moines main library partially reopens as warming center\n\nAfter closing Thursday because of the blizzard, the Des Moines Central Library downtown has repoened its meeting room wing until 5 p.m. as a warming center. All of the other branches remain closed, but will be open and serving as warming centers on Friday, library officials say.\n\nNortheast Iowa farmer works to keep cattle alive, healthy in life-threatening cold\n\nFarming is hard, hazardous work ― perhaps never harder or more hazardous than when temperatures fall to livestock-threatening lows.\n\nAt 5:30 a.m. Thursday, Dave Reuber started shoveling snow out feed troughs for roughly 1,000 cattle at his feedlot in eastern Iowa, about a mile west of Strawberry Point, roughly midway between Waterloo and Dubuque.\n\nWithout the work, moisture would freeze the feed, making it impossible for the cattle to eat, said Reuber, working with three other men. Clearing out the troughs was like “shoveling a mile-long driveway,” said Reuber, layered up from head to toe to keep warm.\n\nAnd that was just the first chore the men needed to tackle before they could begin feeding the cattle. Among the others: Clearing snow from the pens so animals, weighing up to 1,300 pounds, could stay dry and warm, and moving snow from the feedlot roads so they could get to giant bunkers filled with feed.\n\nThe men tackled some of the most important work on Wednesday, before the storm hit, said Reuber, who owns the Eastern Iowa Cattle feedlot with a business partner: They moved bedding ― mostly corn stalks ― into all the cattle’s pens and built windbreaks so some of the animal that are mostly outside have protection. Then they checked all the waterers, using heaters or trickling the water to ensure they didn't freeze up.\n\n“Making sure they have water is a really big deal,” said Reuber, who also provides nutritional services to other producers.\n\nReuber’s crew will go through the routine again Thursday afternoon.\n\nFeeding the cattle twice a day also helps keep the animals warm, Reuber said. “The cattle generate heat, digesting feed. That helps keep their body temperature up.”\n\nThe wind chill at midday was about 30 degrees below zero. But recent snow and cold have helped acclimate the cattle to the pre-holiday storm.\n\n“Us too,” Reuber said.\n\nTruck wreck blocks I-80 lanes\n\nInterstate 80 eastbound is blocked just west of Jordan Creek Parkway because of a semitrailer crash with injuries, the Iowa State Patrol reports. It adds in a tweet: \"Travel is NOT advised on I-80 in between Des Moines and Iowa City!\" Sgt. Alex Dinkla, the state patrol spokesperson, says troopers \"are on back to back calls in several areas.\"\n\nAssigned to the weather beat, sports reporter rebels\n\nPressed into duty to cover the blizzard, sports reporter Mark Woodley of Waterloo's KWWL made no secret of how he felt about the assignment: \"Tune in for the next couple hours to watch me get progressively crankier and crankier.\" And that's probably not even the best line in the collection of outtakes Woodley tweeted.\n\nFlight cancellations, delays continue, but so do airport operations\n\nAcross the nation, flight delays were mounting as the winter storm moved eastward. The Associated Press reported that more than 1,700 flights had been canceled Thursday morning. It said the Chicago O'Hare and Denver airports ― major transfer points for Iowa passengers ― were experiencing the worst disruptions. At Des Moines International Airport, there were several cancellations, particularly for the budget Southwest, Allegiant and Frontier airlines. But plenty of other flights remained scheduled as of midday.\n\nIowa lieutenant governor: It's cold out there\n\nIowa Lt. Gov. Adam Gregg is providing graphic evidence via Twitter of just how cold it is in Iowa on Thursday. Des Moines at 11:15 a.m. was recording a temperature of minus 10 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Storm Lake was minus 15. Perhaps the warmest place, so to speak, in the state: Clinton, with a reading of zero. And that's before wind chill.\n\nIowa State Patrol's message: Don't drive in blizzard\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol is warning in no uncertain terms that driving on Iowa roadways amid Thursday's blizzard conditions is a bad idea.\n\n\"We really want to get the message out to motorists that, although the DOT is clearing the roadways as quickly as possible, there are still areas that look CLEAR, but are a sheet of ice,\" Sgt. Alex Dinkla, the state patrol spokesperson, said in a text. \"We continue to see crashes and vehicles sliding off the roadways.\"\n\nAmong other bulletins from the Iowa Department of Transportation's road conditions website: Iowa 141 \"is completely covered in ice\" and Interstate 80's eastbound lanes are blocked by accidents in two spots. In addition, a westbound lane is blocked by a crash near Coralville.\n\nAllegiant joins other airlines in waiving rebooking fees for weather-canceled flights\n\nAllegiant Air is joining other airlines serving Des Moines International Airport in waiving rebooking fees for flights canceled due to weather. Sonya Padgett, an Allegiant spokesperson, also said customers whose flights are canceled may opt for a full refund.\n\nTo see what airlines are offering, go here.\n\nIowa DOT: I-80 eastbound blocked by crashes\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation is cautioning against travel on Interstate 80, with crashes blocking the eastbound lanes near Grinnell and Williamsburg and one at the exit ramp to Jordan Creek Parkway in the Des Moines metro. It also is reporting multiple crashes blocking portions of Interstate 380 between North Liberty and Shueyville.\n\nDes Moines library clarifies: All branches close because of blizzard\n\nThe Des Moines Public Library clarified Thursday that all of its locations will be closed Thursday because of the blizzard. They are the Central, Forest Avenue, Franklin Avenue and east, north and south side libraries. The libraries serve as warming centers, and library officials pointed to this list of other sites for people seeking shelter.\n\nSome power outages reported as winds rise\n\nMidAmerican Energy, one of Iowa's major power providers, is reporting a smattering of outages across the state due to the blizzard's high winds, including about 200 homes in Warren County and 26 in Marion County.\n\nA handful of outages are being reported in the Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Storm Lake and Quad Cities area, the company said.\n\nAlliant Energy is reporting eight customers across the state are without power due to the storm.\n\nFor outage information, go to MidAmerican Energy's Outage Watch site or Alliant’s outage center.\n\nNumerous Unity Point clinics closed\n\nNumerous Unity Point clinics are closed across central Iowa on Thursday because of the weather, and some also will be closed Friday, according to a notice on Unity Point's website. The health care system also advised that it is having phone problems.\n\n\"Calls are coming into our system, but are being misdirected. This is creating a situation where patients and families cannot reach their care teams. We are currently working on this issue and expect a resolution very soon. If you are having trouble, please call 515-241-5621 or message anne.pederson@unitypoint.org. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\"\n\nDes Moines police report I-235 crashes\n\nDes Moines police reported on Twitter that they were dealing with multiple crashes at Interstate 235 and Guthrie Avenue, including a jack-knifed semi trailer. Motorists should expect delays, the police said.\n\nDes Moines Register newspaper delivery may be delayed\n\nOvernight snowfall and hazardous travel conditions may delay the delivery of the Des Moines Register in many parts of the state on Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022. Our delivery partners are working to ensure delivery as soon as it's safely possible.\n\nThe Register is offering free access to the e-Edition, a digital version of the daily newspaper, to all readers through Sunday. The e-Edition is available at DesMoinesRegister.com/eedition and is normally available only to subscribers.\n\nA Des Moines Register Print Edition app is also available for Apple and Android devices.\n\nBlizzard conditions are expected throughout the state Thursday into Friday. Delivery delays may continue, with delivery not resuming until Sunday in some parts of the state. While we will strive to deliver the paper each day, the safety of our carriers and transportation partners is our highest priority.\n\nSubscribers needing assistance can contact customer support at help.desmoinesregister.com or 1-877-424-0225.\n\nCancellations, delays mount at DSM airport\n\nHoliday travel in the blizzard was off to a shaky start Thursday.\n\nAllegiant Air has canceled most of its arrivals and departures at Des Moines International Airport and other airlines are canceling or delaying flights, the airport's website shows.\n\nSouthwest Airlines canceled its flight leaving at 6 a.m. to St. Louis and its 6:50 a.m. flight to Denver. United Airlines canceled some of its flights to Chicago and Denver. Delta and American airlines have delayed some departures.\n\nAirlines generally were offering no-fee flight changes, though Allegiant on its website advises only that passengers should call its customer service line, which had long hold times Thursday morning.\n\nAirport officials urge travelers to check their site, www.flydsm.com, or use the apps for the airlines they’re flying for changes to their flight. The apps also one of the best ways to reschedule a flight, officials says.\n\nThe Des Moines airport estimated as many as 65,000 people will use the airport over the holidays to travel.\n\nIowa State Patrol responding to crashes across the state\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol says troopers have responded to more than 70 motor vehicle accidents on Iowa’s road since midday Wednesday and helped 141 motorists in distress that period.\n\nAt 8 a.m. Thursday, Iowa Department of Transportation reported there had been multiple additional single and multi-vehicle crashes on interstates and state highways since the state patrol released totals at 5 a.m.\n\nNational Weather Service: Stay inside!\n\nAs winds picked up Thursday morning and temperatures across Iowa plunged into negative territory, the National Weather Service in repeated the warning it has forecast over the past several days: \"Blizzard conditions combined with dangerous wind chills will create life threatening conditions for anyone that ventures out during the worst of this storm.\"\n\nThe temperature in Des Moines as of 7:30 a.m. was minus 6 degrees, with a 22 mph wind gusting to 31 mph, sending the wind chill to minus 30 degrees. The state was blanketed with 2 to 4 inches of snow, with isolated pockets of up to 5 inches. Forecasters expect the wind to easily loft the dry, loose flakes, creating whiteout conditions at times.\n\nSnow has largely ended, but winds are forecast to increase, then remain steady and strong through most of Saturday.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation echoed the weather service's warning, saying travel is not recommended. On Facebook, it showed a snowplow crew preparing for the day in Coralville, and asked those who do choose to drive to be careful and help keep its workers safe: \"If you can stay put today, please do that. If you must travel, please drive with caution, especially around snowplows. We want all of our snowfighters to get home to their families at the end of the shift.\"\n\nToo cold for Salvation Army bellringers, Rudolph\n\nOne of the most admirable things about Salvation Army bellringers is the endurance they display, standing in the cold to raise money for their cause. But even for them, there are limits. The Salvation Army of Des Moines announced that the bellringers won't be at their usual red kettles on Thursday as the blizzard's winds drive \"feels-like\" temperatures as low as 40 degrees below zero. The charity also is closing its food pantries for the day, but notes that faithful givers can still support its work with gifts made at desmoinesredkettle.org.\n\nPreviously:Second rare gold coin valued around $2k found in Salvation Army kettle in Des Moines\n\nLikewise, Rudolph will be taking a break from guiding Santa's sleigh until it warms up ― at least a little. Des Moines Performing Arts says both the 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Thursday performances of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Musical\" have been postponed. Ticketholders will be notified when performances are rescheduled in 2023, it said, and previously purchased tickets will be accepted.\n\nSouthern Iowa conditions monitored in case blizzard warning needs to be expanded\n\nSouthern Iowa wasn't included in the blizzard warning, but the National Weather Service says that could change as the storm rolls in.\n\n\"To the south, land use and topography along with no existing snowpack raises questions about whether blizzard conditions would materialize. However, we will monitor in case confidence increases to expand the warning,\" the weather service says in its latest forecast discussion.\n\nThe guidance also says snow totals across the region should be 3 to 6 inches, with the snow ending by midday Thursday as blizzard-level winds kick up.\n\nElsewhere, the blizzard's footprint was changing. Western Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, northeast Kansas and western Nebraska were removed from the blizzard warning. But the western and northern lower peninsula of Michigan, the eastern upper peninsula and parts of North and South Dakota and eastern Montana were added, as well as a sliver of northeastern Wyoming. Weather service guidance for Wisconsin said the blizzard warning was dropped there because of a decreased snowfall total.\n\nDes Moines Public Library, usually a warming center, to close for storm\n\nThe Des Moines Public Library announced on social media late Wednesday that it would be closed Thursday because of the blizzard. The library system is among designated warming centers in the city, and the posting directed people needing somewhere to go as temperatures plunge to check for alternate sites. A list of warming centers is available here.\n\nThe posting did not specify whether only the central library downtown would be closed, or the branch libraries, as well. They are the Forest Avenue, Franklin Avenue and east, north and south side libraries.\n\nIowans stocking up on dairy products as blizzard looms\n\nIowans are buying the bad-weather standards: “Milk, bread and eggs,” Miriam Anderson Brown, CEO of Des Moines dairy Anderson Erickson, said Wednesday, adding that the company is pushing to meet demand for its products as the blizzard approaches.\n\nCustomers also are buying whipping cream, sour cream and other cooking essentials, Anderson Brown said.\n\n“Based on what we see, people are going to stay in and bake” while the blizzard rages, she said.\n\nAnd drink eggnog ― “they’re buying a lot of eggnog,” she said.\n\nLike dairy producers across the state, the company plans to continue working as long as possible into the storm, picking up milk and processing and delivering products. The business will stop only if the weather forces it to.\n\nWhether it's inclement weather or the holiday, “We have to keep that product moving from cow to consumer, no matter what,” Anderson Brown said. “That’s what you sign up for.”\n\nSchool, business and other storm- and holiday-related closures will allow the dairy to cut some deliveries and shift products, especially to grocery stores, she said.\n\n“We have to be patient and see what Mother Nature gives us,” she said.\n\nSnow starts falling in earnest\n\nSnow was falling across the Des Moines metro shortly after 4 p.m., and streets were quickly becoming slick. The National Weather Service said the snow would continue through Thursday morning but that the accumulation would be moderate, at less than 6 inches, though some parts of eastern Iowa could receive more. But it repeatedly warned that the light, dry, flakey snow would be easily lofted by the blizzard's winds, arriving Thursday afternoon, and pose an extreme danger of whiteouts on the state's roadways.\n\nLibraries close ahead of blizzard's arrival\n\nSeveral Des Moines metro area libraries announced Wednesday afternoon that they will close earlier than usual this week due to the blizzard. Among them:\n\nThe Altoona library will be closed Thursday. Due dates for checked-out materials will not be enforced through the weekend, according to a library Facebook post.\n\nThe West Des Moines and Clive libraries will be closed through Dec. 26.\n\nThe Johnston library will be closed through Dec. 25 due. Due dates for that period have been changed to Dec. 26, according to a library Facebook post.\n\nDes Moines government says shelters are prepared\n\nThe city of Des Moines is coordinating with the city's privately run shelters and the Polk County Emergency Management Agency as they seek to ensure homeless people are safe during the coming cold wave, City Manager Scott Sanders said in a news release.\n\n\"There are two primary homeless shelters in Des Moines who, during extreme weather, can increase their overnight capacity,\" Sanders said. \"During our last check with them, they have plenty of room, warmth and food. They have also instituted their weather amnesty plan which removes restrictions for entry. Our partners are also actively encouraging individuals to seek shelter within their facilities.\"\n\nHe urged all Des Moines residents to \"check on those in our community and neighborhoods who might need some additional attention and care.\"\n\nVon Maur swarmed by shoppers seeking to beat the blizzard\n\nIowans are making a mad dash to get their Christmas shopping done, said Melody Wright, chief operating officer at Von Maur, the Davenport-based department store chain that last month moved its longtime Des Moines store at Valley West Mall to Jordan Creek Town Center.\n\nShoppers flooded the store Tuesday and were there in force again Wednesday, Wright said.\n\n“People definitely got the message that the weather is coming,” Wright said. “They know Thursday and Friday could be questionable.\"\n\nThe traffic is equal to “what you would expect to see on a Friday or Saturday … not a Tuesday,” she said, adding that the company sent corporate staff members to the new store to help keep up with demand.\n\nShoppers are making major purchases, not just small gifts to round out their lists, she said.\n\n“It’s big, big items. It’s that handbag that the wife has wanted for a long time that can run several hundred dollars to $1,500,” she said.\n\nThe department store chain is closely monitoring the weather to determine whether it should remain open Thursday and Friday, Wright said. “Our biggest concern is that it’s safe for employees to come in,” she said.\n\nWright said she expects some customers will want to squeeze in a few purchases on Christmas Eve, even though last-minute shopping “is not quite as crazy as it used to be.”\n\nEastern metro cities issue parking restrictions for storm\n\nThe eastern suburbs of Des Moines have all declared parking restrictions ahead of the blizzard:\n\nAltoona's snow ordinance, banning parking on city streets, will be in place indefinitely, according to the Altoona Police Department.\n\nAnkeny's snow ordinance is in place until noon Saturday.

CO is called the invisible killer because it is colorless and odorless. Exposed persons may become unconscious before experiencing CO-poisoning symptoms of nausea, dizziness or weakness, and it can lead to death,” the agency said in a news release.\n\nAdditionally, residents should use care when using portable heaters, candles and other heat and light sources, the agency said.\n\nIn the case of a power outage, the commission says:\n\nOperate portable generators outside only, at least 20 feet away from occupied structures, and direct the generator’s exhaust away from homes and any other buildings people may enter. Also, close any windows and other openings in the path of the generator’s exhaust. Do not operate a generator on a porch or in a carport. They are too close to the home.\n\nCheck that portable generators have been maintained properly, and read and follow the labels, instructions and warnings on the generator and in the owner’s manual.\n\nWhen buying a portable generators, look for models that have a carbon monoxide shut-off safety feature, which is designed to shut the generator off automatically when high levels of the gas are present around the generator.\n\nWith portable heaters, people should:\n\nKeep all sides of the heater at least 3 feet from beds, clothes, curtains, papers, sofas and other items that can catch fire.\n\nAlways use a wall outlet, never a power strip, and never run the heater’s cord under rugs or carpeting.\n\nMake sure the heater is not near water. Never touch it if you are wet.\n\nPlace the heater on a stable, level surface where it will not be knocked over.\n\nNever leave a heater running unattended in a confined space.\n\nThe agency urges consumers to never use charcoal indoors, which also can create lethal carbon monoxide levels. That includes cooking on a charcoal grill in a garage, even with an open door.\n\nIt also warns consumers to use flashlights instead of candles during power outages. If using candles, do not place them on or near anything that can catch fire. Never leave burning candles unattended. Extinguish candles when leaving the room and before sleeping.\n\nCentral Iowa weather forecast: How much snow are we supposed to get?\n\nThe National Weather Service in its latest forecast calls for snowfall to begin early afternoon Wednesday, picking up after 4 p.m. and ending by about noon Thursday. The forecast total isn't severe ― about 4 inches. More concerning is the wind, which is expected to accelerate after midnight, blowing steadily at 20 mph to 25 mph through Friday before beginning to taper off Saturday.\n\nWith extremely low temperatures already forecast, that will bring severe wind chills (click here for an illustrated explanation of that \"feels like\" temperature, and how this event will compare to previous ones in central Iowa) and blowing snow, which can cause whiteouts ― a severe threat to travelers.\n\nThe weather service points out that in urban areas, with buildings and trees to baffle the wind, visibility can appear fine, but that in rural areas, the danger posed by blowing snow can be much more severe, and that people shouldn't make assumptions about whether it's safe to travel based solely on conditions in their neighborhoods.\n\nMore:How much snow is coming to Iowa?

She didn't plan on meeting cover model Red Currier and falling head over heels in love. And it doesn't help her happily-ever-after that she's masquerading as her married, three-months-pregnant sister.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/27/hemingway-look-alike-shrinking-great-salt-lake-polish-war-hero-news-around-states/117668764/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The founder and chief executive of the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama will leave the nonprofit organization at the end of the year, the group said in a statement. Isabel Rubio, who has led the Birmingham-based organization for 20 years, will be replaced by chief operating officer Carlos Aleman, who went to work for the group as deputy director three years ago. The coalition, which advocates for Latino and immigrant families in Alabama, helped lead opposition and provided community services when the state passed a restrictive law dealing with immigrants a decade ago. Court challenges later gutted the law. Growing from a staff of one, the coalition said it now has a staff of more than two dozen bilingual workers who serve more than 5,000 people annually. Rubio has raised more than $19 million to support the Hispanic community with small business development, citizenship, college and home ownership.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A popular strip club that once beckoned customers off a busy highway leading into Anchorage is now a church offering salvation – instead of temptation – behind the daughter of a former exotic dancer. Linda Dunegan believes divine intervention played a hand in transforming the building that housed Fantasies on 5th into the start-up Open Door Baptist Church, turning the show floor into a sanctuary and trading the dancer’s pole with a pulpit. “This church came about because I prayed for five years,” said Dunegan, who tried to buy the building before but walked away – for good, she thought – when she and the owner couldn’t come to terms. Then the owner gave a real estate agent a week to sell it and suggested the agent call Dunegan. This time, the deal went through. “God has been very good to me,” Dunegan said, “to give me a family, a wonderful husband, food on the table, a place to live.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:An Arizona Republican official said ballots stored for the review of the Maricopa County 2020 election were not damaged by water leaking from the ceiling at a state fairgrounds building during Phoenix-area monsoon thunderstorms. “No ballots are at risk,” Randy Pullen, representing state Senate Republicans who ordered the election review, told the Arizona Republic. Pullen said he was at the building when leaks began. He said workers covered boxes with tarps for protection and moved them away from the leaks inside the Weslin Bolin Building as rain poured outside. Pullen identified four leaks above where work is taking place, as well as leaks in other parts of the building. He told the Republic he called fairgrounds management to fix them. The Bolin building is an exhibit hall usually used for trade shows. It is not air-conditioned. The ballot review moved to the building earlier this month after the state Senate’s lease ended at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, also on the fairgrounds property.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: COVID-19 continues to rage through Arkansas as new day-over-day cases topped 2,000 for the first time since February. State health officials reported 2,015 new cases Saturday as the highly contagious delta variant swept across the state, prompting the state to resume weekend daily updates. Another 1,022 were reported Sunday. Forty-eight more COVID-19 cases required hospitalization over the weekend, and 13 more deaths were reported. The state averaged 626 new cases a day per 100,000 population over the past two weeks, an increase of 140.7% and a rate that topped the nation’s states, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. Although the Arkansas vaccination rate has been among the nation’s lowest, State Epidemiologist Jennifer Dillaha told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that 32,466 first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered last week, the most since late April.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The state has given the University of California, San Diego $35 million to build a coastal research vessel that will focus on such pressing topics as sea-level rise, the health of marine fisheries, ocean acidification, El Nino and the atmospheric rivers that periodically bring damaging storms to California. The university’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography will oversee the design and construction of the 125-foot vessel, which will have a hydrogen-hybrid propulsion system, an emerging technology meant to limit the release of greenhouse gases. The vessel – whose funding comes from the state’s general fund – will primarily sail in California waters, and also will be able to operate with diesel fuel. The ship will be used for research and education, replacing the research vessel Robert Gordon Sproul, which is nearing the end of its 40-year service life. Scripps also operates two large research ships, the Sally Ride and the Roger Revelle, and a small, near-shore vessel, the Bob and Betty Beyster.\n\nColorado\n\nLa Junta:Nine Otero County restaurants received nearly $622,000 in federal COVID-19 relief funding from Restaurant Revitalization Fund grants. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund was designed by Congress as part of this year’s American Rescue Plan Act. About $28.6 billion worth of grants were awarded to restaurants, bars and food trucks throughout the nation. Nearly $500 million was awarded to Colorado alone, according to Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper. Otero County restaurants receiving grants included Copper Kitchen, Eagle’s Lanes & Eagle’s Nest, El Azteca Mexican Restaurant, Felisa’s Mexican Food and Lounge and JJ’s Inc. in La Junta. RPF grants were also given to Frontier Diner in Cheraw, Majestyk, Inc. in Manzanola, Tamarack Grill in Fowler and Rocky Ford’s China Kitchen. No businesses in Crowley or Bent counties received such grants.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut could lag behind most states in regaining hotel jobs lost during the coronavirus pandemic, according to projections by a national trade group. The American Hotel and Lodging Association predicted the state will have regained a little less than 72% of its roughly 26,000 direct hotel industry jobs by year’s end. The projected 7,400 unfilled jobs is a more dire forecast than the group made in May, when it predicted a gap of about 5,900 jobs. The group predicted only four states – Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York – and the District of Columbia will regain smaller percentages than Connecticut by the end of 2021. It estimated the hotel industry will end 2021 down about 500,000 jobs compared to 2019 levels. Direct hotel jobs include positions such as housekeeper and front desk attendant but don’t include jobs such as restaurant or retail workers or other small businesses supported by the hotel industry. Experts said vacation and leisure travel in Connecticut has rebounded but business travel has lagged considerably. Business travelers account for roughly 60% of the hotel industry’s customer base.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:No Delaware hospitals – including the state-run psychiatric facility – are complying with federal regulations to post prices on their websites, according to a recent report. This month, Patient Rights Advocate published a report that found that 94.4% of U.S. hospitals are failing to follow the hospital price transparency rule that was put in place during the Trump administration. The list included all of the acute care hospitals in Delaware, as well as a number of behavioral health organizations. In January, hospitals were required to post the costs of services for all payers and plans and have a list or price estimator that calculates the 300 most common services. Before this law went into effect, the hospital industry sued to prevent posting prices but ultimately lost. President Joe Biden earlier this month issued an executive order that told the secretary of Health and Human Services to “support existing hospital price transparency rules.” ChristianaCare, the largest health system in Delaware, said in a statement that it has been “committed to price transparency” and launched its price website in 2018, years before the federal mandate.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:D.C. officials are asking people to stay out of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers as summer heat sends many toward local waterways, WUSA-TV reported. “The entire river is inherently dangerous because it looks calm,” said D.C. Fire and EMS Captain Paul O’Conner. “But underneath the moving water ... that looks easy to swim in (are) many obstructions.” Agency spokesperson Vito Maggiolo said three people have accidentally drowned in D.C. waters this year. The most dangerous area is on the northwest edge of the city near Fletcher’s Boathouse, according to Maggiolo. “Strong currents, they’ll pull you under,” he said. “Rocks, you’ll get tossed around. It’s almost like a vortex, being in a washing machine.” If that’s not enough, there’s another reason not to jump into the rivers: It’s illegal. DCFEMS and DC Police confirmed swimming in the Anacostia or Potomac rivers is against the law.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: There’s a new Ernest Hemingway look-alike in Key West. Zach Taylor of Ambrose, Georgia, won this year’s contest to celebrate the author during the island’s annual Hemingway Days festival. The 63-year-old business owner beat out 136 other entrants at Sloppy Joe’s Bar, the Key West saloon where Hemingway frequently drank. Competing in the contest is a family affair for Taylor. His late father-in-law, Carlie Coley, was the winner in 2000. His wife and mother-in-law shared his victory celebration Saturday night. “Hemingway has been a fixture of ours since we started coming down to the contest,” Taylor said. “And you know, I think ‘Papa’ would be proud of what’s been accomplished in his name in a town he loved so well.” Saturday night’s competitors paraded across Sloppy Joe’s stage, trying to impress the judging panel of former winners, while the audience cheered and applauded. In 2020, the contest was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Like Taylor, most 2021 entrants attempted to emulate the “Papa” persona adopted by the author in his later years. Some pleaded for victory through poems or song fragments including finalist David “Bat” Masterson, who accompanied his original tune on the harmonica. As well as resembling Hemingway, Taylor said he shares the Nobel Prize-winning author’s passion for fishing, hunting and the life of an outdoorsman.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: The demolition and removal of an overturned cargo ship along the Georgia coast is inching closer to completion. Crews on Thursday began cutting through steel to remove a sixth chunk of the Golden Ray and take it away on a barge to a facility in Brunswick. Roughly two-thirds of the ship has been removed since demolition began in November. The cut that started Thursday will be the second-to=last one on the project, the Brunswick News reported. Section 6 is about 73 feet long and weighs approximately 3,700 metric tons. The South Korean-owned Golden Ray capsized with more than 4,200 automobiles in its cargo decks shortly after departing the Port of Brunswick on Sept. 8, 2019. Investigators concluded the ship tipped over because unstable loading left its center of gravity too high. The entire crew was rescued safely but the ship was deemed a total loss. Demolition of the ship has been slower than officials predicted. The project reached the halfway mark with removal of the fourth section in April. The fifth chunk was cut away in early July.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Testing of drinking water at Hawaii’s public schools found at least 93 faucets and fountains have elevated concentrations of lead. The contaminated water was found among 2,232 sampled taps at 58 schools on Maui, Kauai and the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Testing on Oahu began in July, and the results will be released as they become available. An additional four taps with elevated levels of lead were found among 100 sampled sources at 70 child care centers in the state. The results show elevated lead in about 4% of the samples collected so far, officials said. The water testing returned lead concentrations above a project action level of 15 parts per billion. State officials said the compromised fixtures were taken out of commission, and the facilities were notified. Faucet fixtures appeared to be the problem in most cases, but follow-up testing will reveal if plumbing is to blame, said Michael Miyahira, acting branch chief of the Department of Health’s Safe Drinking Water Branch. This is the first time Hawaii’s public schools have been comprehensively tested for lead in drinking water. The state received a $222,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant to do the testing.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials are working on a hemp plan to submit to federal officials this fall so that farmers can grow it next year. State Department of Agriculture Deputy Director Chanel Tewalt told the Capital Press last week that the state intends to submit its plan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture by Sept. 1. Idaho lawmakers earlier this year approved the growing and selling of hemp products containing 0.3% or less of THC, the cannabis compound that gives marijuana its high. The State Department of Agriculture plans to submit the hemp plan in early August to Republican Gov. Brad Little and the State Police for their approval. Little, who signed the bill approving hemp in Idaho into law in April, and law enforcement officials have expressed concern that hemp could be used as a cover for growing or transporting marijuana. The overall effort is to align state law with federal law contained in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp. Idaho is the only state that still treats hemp like marijuana. That has prevented Idaho framers from growing hemp, which backers say can be a lucrative crop.\n\nIllinois\n\nWayne: A tick species native to the southeastern part of the United States has been found outside Chicago. Three Gulf Coast ticks were located earlier this month in the Dunham Forest Preserve in Wayne, according to The (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald. Wayne is roughly 40 miles west of Chicago. The species is more likely than others to carry the pathogen causing Tidewater spotted fever, which could cause a headache, muscle aches and rash, among other things. “Don’t be scared, be prepared. We don’t need to freak out,” said Holly Tuten, vector ecologist for the Illinois Natural History Survey Medical Entomology Lab at the University of Illinois. The ticks have previously found in more than a dozen Illinois counties, but in small numbers. Then last year, 780 were found in Illinois after researchers found a new way of searching for them, Tuten told the newspaper. However, only adults have been found, suggesting they might not be able to survive Illinois winters. Experts said Gulf Coast ticks can be avoided in the same ways as other ticks. Experts recommend remaining on the center of nature trails and wearing protective clothing when in grassy areas.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington:Public beaches along the Lake Monroe shoreline remained closed Friday more than a week after multiple rounds of heavy rain passed through south-central Indiana. The beaches at Fairfax and Paynetown state recreation areas were closed by lake officials after several days of heavy downpours caused widespread flooding in the area. Michael Prier, an office worker at the Paynetown office at Lake Monroe, told The Herald Times that lake waters on Thursday were up 6 feet from typical levels. Days earlier, the lake was 10 feet above normal. Lake Monroe’s public fishing docks also remain closed because of the high water. Some county roads that are used to travel around the lake additionally remain underwater, according to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Boaters are encouraged by the IDNR to use “extreme caution” on the lake because of possible floating debris and hidden obstacles in the lake. All boat ramps and campgrounds near Lake Monroe remain open.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:More than 100 people gathered outside the state Capitol on Saturday to rally against mandates requiring people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, such as the ones some Iowa hospitals have issued. One of the speakers at the rally, Republican state Rep. Jeff Shipley, called vaccine mandates “a crime against humanity.” People in the crowd held signs that read “stop vax bullying” and “mandates belong in socialist countries.” The event was organized by a group called Informed Choice Iowa that opposes mandatory coronavirus vaccinations and vaccine passports. Brei Johnson with that group told the Des Moines Register that she believes vaccinations should be discussed between a health professional and patient, not made a condition of employment. “You can take off a mask but you can’t undo a vaccine. That’s a slippery slope to what comes next,” Johnson said. Earlier this month, the owner of seven MercyOne hospitals and related clinics said all employees would be required to get vaccinated or risk termination. The hospitals and clinics are in Clinton, Dubuque, Dyersville, Mason City, New Hampton, Primghar and Sioux City. The Iowa Department of Public Health said nearly 47% of Iowa residents have been fully vaccinated against the virus.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A retired University of Kansas professor received Poland’s Medal of Valor this weekend more than 75 years after he fought with the Polish resistance against the occupying forces of Nazi Germany during World War II. Polish Air Force Major Gen. Cezary Wisniewski who is based at the Polish embassy in Washington, visited Jarek Piekalkiewicz’s home in Lawrence on Saturday to give him Poland’s second-highest combat honor on his 95th birthday. Wisniewski said the honor was overlooked during the war and then the post-war communist government of Poland refused to honor the country’s wartime resistance fighters. The recommendation that Piekalkiewicz receive the medal for his efforts was recently discovered in Poland’s archives, according to the Lawrence Journal-World. Piekalkiewicz joined the Polish resistance at age 16. Two years later, he was promoted to platoon sergeant and commanded 1,000 men during the bloody uprising of 1944 when roughly 6,000 resistance soldiers were killed before the resistance surrendered in October when its forces ran short of ammunition and food. Piekalkiewicz said he then became a prisoner of war at a German labor camp, and he tried to escape three times before he finally succeeded. Later, he served with the U.S. Army and British military. After the war, he earned his bachelor’s degree and met his wife at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, before coming to the United States and earning his doctorate. He went on to teach at KU from 1963 to 2000,\n\nKentucky\n\nIrvine: State officials have celebrated the opening of a $14.7 million technology center serving Estill, Powell and surrounding counties in eastern Kentucky. The center will serve high school and technical college students and provide training for displaced workers seeking new career paths. Gov. Andy Beshear participated in the recent grand opening, along with state Education Commissioner Jason Glass and Senate President Robert Stivers. Beshear praised the “forward thinking of leaders that laid the groundwork” for the project. The Estill County Area Technology Center will serve about 300 students from Estill, Powell and surrounding counties, Beshear’s office said. It will house six career and technical programs and will be home to the Estill County Success/Virtual Academy. “Technical centers, like the new Estill County Area Technology Center, are key to preparing the future workforce of Kentucky,” Glass said. “Our students will develop the latest and most in-demand skills in high demand areas, including health and computer sciences.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Republican U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, a critic of mask mandates and public health restrictions during the pandemic, said he, his wife and son have contracted the coronavirus. He made the announcement on Facebook on Sunday night. He said he and his wife had been infected last year, but this time around is much more difficult. He has not said whether he has been vaccinated. “This episode is far more challenging. It has required all my devoted energy,” he said. “We are all under excellent care, and our prognosis is positive.” Higgins is the second member of Congress to announce in the last week that they contracted the virus. Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican who represents parts of southwest Florida, said July 19 that he had tested positive. Buchanan said he had been fully vaccinated and was experiencing mild symptoms. Higgins has said he doesn’t support mask mandates or mandatory vaccines. In a May Facebook post, Higgins said: “If you want to get vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask. If you don’t, then don’t. That’s your right as a free American.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Some unemployment claimants in Maine and elsewhere will soon have to submit proof that they were employed when they lost a job because of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government is requiring the proof of employment by Aug. 4 for people who have received Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. The rule applies to anyone who has received the benefits beginning with the week that ended Jan 2. The Maine Department of Labor said claimants must submit the proof of employment as soon as possible to avoid a denial of benefits. Overpayment of benefits would require the claimant to repay benefits, the department said. There were 100 initial claims filed for federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in Maine in the week that ended July 17.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Colleges and universities in Maryland are adjusting computer software and hiring additional staff to manage vaccination records for COVID-19 ahead of the fall semester. The Baltimore Sun reported administrators are devising plans to verify compliance with vaccine mandates and to process applications for an exemption. Earlier this year,14 schools across the state said they would require students and employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine before the fall. Some schools have collected immunization records for years. But they’re now doing so on a larger scale and will include employees. Unvaccinated students who lack an exemption might not be allowed to live on campus or access campus facilities. Some could also see their registration for courses canceled.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Rachael Rollins, who has pushed for progressive criminal justice reforms as the first woman of color to serve as a district attorney in Massachusetts, has been nominated by President Joe Biden to become the state’s top federal prosecutor. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Rollins, who has led the Suffolk County district attorneys office since 2019, would become the first Black woman to serve as U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. Rollins defeated the district attorney candidate backed by the longtime incumbent and police groups in the 2018 Democratic primary on a promise to decline prosecution for certain low-level crimes. She argued people shouldn’t be jailed for crimes that result from mental health or addiction problems and said she wanted to focus her attention on serious crimes, like homicides. Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, who recommended Rollins for the job, said they are “certain that she will be a tremendous U.S. attorney” and pledged to work to make sure she’s confirmed as quickly as possible.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:The National Weather Service said tornadoes struck near Detroit and near Flint on Saturday night. The EF-1 tornadoes touched down in Genesee County’s Clayton Township about 6:30 p.m. and in Oakland County about 7:45 p.m., the weather service said. Damage from both storms was consistent with winds of 100 mph and they traveled about 1.8 miles, damaging trees. One person suffered minor injuries. Thousands of utility customers in the Detroit area had no power Sunday following a night of severe storms. DTE Energy reported nearly 135,000 customers in Oakland and Macomb counties had no service at 10:20 a.m. because of wind damage. Consumers Energy reported more than 650 customers without power in Oakland County’s Holly Township at 9:45 a.m. DTE had more than 500 crews in the field and “will be working around the clock to restore power to impacted customers as quickly and safely as possible,” the utility reported on its website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota officially adopted regulations championed by Gov. Tim Walz to encourage the switchover to electric vehicles. The “clean car” rules published in the State Register take effect in 2024 with the 2025 model year. They will require manufacturers and dealers to supply more electric vehicles for the Minnesota marketplace. The Walz administration said the rules will lead to cleaner air and help fight climate change by increasing the choices Minnesotans have for purchasing electric cars. It said the changes will protect public health and save Minnesotans money at the pump. But Scott Lambert, president of the Minnesota Automobile Dealers Association, said the rules put California in charge of writing Minnesota’s regulations because the state is essentially adopting California’s standards, and can’t modify them under federal law. He said the changes will swamp Minnesota dealers with more electric vehicles than customers want to buy, and force up car prices for everyone.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Education will temporarily move out of its headquarters in the old Central High School building in downtown Jackson so repairs can be made to alleviate repeated leaks and flooding. The department will lease office space at South Pointe Business Park in the Jackson suburb of Clinton, officials said in a news release Monday. Some employees will start working there sometime in mid-August, and others will work remotely. The department said phone numbers and email addresses for all staff will remain the same. This is the second time in recent years for the Department of Education to temporarily move to South Pointe. The first time was in 2015, when a fire in a downtown Jackson hotel damaged the old Central High building. Those repairs were completed after a year. The Legislature will have to set aside money for the new repairs.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis area has become one of the first in the country to reinstate mask requirements amid a rise in cases that health officials are blaming on low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant. Despite pushback from some elected officials, face coverings became mandatory Monday in indoor public places and on public transportation in St. Louis city and St. Louis County for everyone age 5 or older – even for those who are vaccinated. Wearing masks outdoors is strongly encouraged, especially in group settings. “For those who are vaccinated this may feel like punishment, punishment for doing the right thing,” St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, a Democrat, said at a news conference Monday. “I’ve heard that and I feel that frustration. While the vaccination can protect against serious illness, it can’t protect you from being infected with COVID-19 and passing it onto someone else, someone who may be more vulnerable.” The decision came as both of Missouri’s urban areas have seen a big uptick in coronavirus hospitalizations that began in rural areas of the state, especially in southwestern Missouri. Missouri ranks fourth nationally in the most new cases per capita in the past 14 days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nCascade:The Cascade County Sheriff’s Department has issued a pre-evacuation warning for “everything south of Cascade” in advance of a wildfire, Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said in a text Sunday afternoon. “A pre-evacuation warning has been issued for the Sheep Creek Lane area, everything south of Cascade,” Slaughter said in the text. “Deputies are being called in to make notifications.” Also, the County Sheriff’s Department and the Montana Highway Patrol were conducting pre-evacuation warnings for the northern part of the Belt Creek Drainage as well as the town of Monarch being threatened by another wildfire as of 6:47 p.m. Sunday. According to the Inciweb website, that fire started Friday at about noon by lightning about 10 miles southeast of Cascade and has since grown to 3,623 acres. It is east of the Dearborn Rest Area on Interstate 15 at the Cascade-Lewis and Clark County Line. A total of 132 firefighting personnel were on the scene, including two Type 1 hotshot crews and three Type 2 Initial Attack Crews, along with three bulldozers and five fire engines. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation is coordinating with the Cascade County Sheriff’s Department and multiple volunteer fire departments in Cascade County.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Four people were injured when a second-floor outdoor deck collapsed during a barbecue, trapping the people and leaving serious burns on one woman when a hot charcoal grill fell on her. First responders said the incident happened about 9 p.m. Sunday at a home in Bellevue. Several people were on the deck when it collapsed, officials said, causing them to fall 10- to 12-feet to the ground. Four people, including the woman with first- and second-degree burns, were taken to local hospitals. Officials said some people at the scene declined treatment.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:The airport serving Nevada’s second-largest metro area faces a shortage of jet fuel that could force the cancellation of cargo and passenger fights, potentially restricting the flow of tourists and essential goods into the northern part of the state. Nevada’s political leaders issued a statement late Saturday pledging to minimize disruption at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport and ensure the aerial fight against Western wildfires isn’t hampered. Besides serving Reno, a popular gambling destination, the airport is the nearest passenger terminal to Lake Tahoe. “To be clear, further failure to secure adequate fuel supplies is unacceptable,” wrote Gov. Steve Sisolak, Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, and U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei. Airport officials across West have voiced concerns about jet fuel shortages and their effect on what is shaping up to be a busy wildfire season. Jet fuel demand declined sharply and supply chains atrophied during the coronavirus pandemic, according to aviation supply companies, jet fuel transport companies and others. They have yet to bounce back in the West even as the economy picks up and people flock to airports for long-delayed trips.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMoultonborough: Parents are demanding answers after a summer camp that called itself one of the best in the nation unexpectedly shut down after just six days this month. Officials at Camp Quinebarge notified parents in early July that they needed to pick up their children after delays in food shipments made it impossible to continue, The Boston Globe reported. All remaining sessions for the overnight camp were canceled. But some parents told The Globe that problems appeared to go beyond food deliveries. Stories surfaced about counselors who were hired days before camp with little training. Campers reported that multiple meals were served on dirty dishes. Some parents said their children were quarantined after they vomited and that the parents were not notified. The camp’s executive director, Eric Carlson, apologized to parents but said the closure was tied to industry-wide staffing and supply chain problems and not because of any long-term problems with the camp’s operations. The camp had been licensed to operate by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, but it closed before an in-season inspection was performed, a department spokesperson told The Globe. Some parents have said they deserve a full accounting of what happened at the 85-year-old camp, which costs $3,400 for two weeks. Although some defend the camp, some have swapped horror stories on a Facebook group for aggrieved parents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHackensack:Advocacy groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security against the Bergen County Jail on behalf of 15 current and former inmates, with allegations of sexual assault, medical and physical abuse, religious discrimination, COVID-19 negligence and generally “deplorable” conditions. The complaint called for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end its agreement with the jail and release all immigrants detained at the facility. Freedom for Immigrants, the Center for Constitutional Rights and UnLocal jointly filed the complaint. It includes testimonies from current and former inmates, some who kept anonymous because of fear of retaliation. One inmate told Freedom For Immigrants’ hotline that a correctional officer sexually assaulted him, and then was told by the officer “you can’t do anything about it.”At least three inmates complained of medical neglect. One man said he was diagnosed with HPV and diabetes while in jail, and since then has been denied proper treatment for both ailments. Another said he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013, but after having an X-ray conducted by a doctor at the jail, he was told everything was “fine,” despite feeling constant pain. The Bergen County Sheriff’s Office had previously denied similar allegations. Regarding this complaint, the sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Indian Resources Development at New Mexico State University, in partnership with Navajo Technical University, received a four-year, $250,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture to develop experiential learning opportunities to increase retention and graduation of Native American students at New Mexico land-grant institutions. Housed in NMSU’s College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, Indian Resources Development and NTU were awarded the grant with support of Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, American Indian Chamber of Commerce, Flower Hill Institute and the Navajo Nation Department of Natural Resources. The project will offer experiential learning opportunities that foster connections between Native American students’ cultural background and their academic experiences along with relevant real-world internships, professional development and career exploration opportunities. Mentors from regional land-grant institutions, Tribal entities and Native professionals also will collaborate on the project.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city will require all of its municipal workers – including teachers and police officers – to get coronavirus vaccines by mid-September or face weekly coronavirus testing, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The rule is expected to affect about 340,000 city employees, making the city one of the largest employers in the U.S. to take such action. Although it isn’t a vaccine mandate – no workers will be forced to take a shot – officials hope the inconvenience and discomfort of weekly tests will persuade many to overcome a reluctance to get inoculated. “This is about our recovery. This is about what we need to do to bring back New York City,” de Blasio said. “This is about keeping people safe.” The Sept. 13 deadline coincides with the start of public school, when the Democratic mayor has said he expects all pupils to be in classrooms full-time. City health care workers and employees in congregate setting such as group homes will face earlier deadlines. The move came as the city fights a rise in COVID-19 cases fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Since the end of June, the daily average of new cases has increased by more than 300%.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Officials said no one was seriously injured when a small airplane flipped over onto its roof shortly after landing at the Ocracoke Island Airport on North Carolina’s Outer Banks. The incident happened about 1:30 p.m. Sunday, a news release from the Cape Hatteras National Seashore said. The single-engine airplane came to rest in grass near the end of the runway, and emergency officials responded. Neither the pilot nor passenger required transport to a hospital, according to the news release. The Federal Aviation Administration was notified and no further details were immediately available.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota Department of Transportation has added dozens of self-serve kiosks across the state to help residents avoid what can sometimes be a long wait at motor vehicle stations. The DOT has completed adding 44 kiosks, an effort it began earlier this year. Residents can now use 52 kiosks to renew a license, request a replacement license or ID card, schedule a road test, pay a reinstatement fee, change an address and edit donor registry information, the Bismarck Tribune reported. They also can check the status of their license, driving record and commercial driver’s license medical card. An initial REAL ID card isn’t available at the kiosk, but its renewal is possible. “The new driver’s license kiosk upgrades add another convenient option for customers doing business with the NDDOT and also expands services into rural communities,” DOT Director Bill Panos said. Motor vehicle registration renewals, nonresident temporary registration requests and applying for a mobility impairment placard are also available at the kiosks.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state doesn’t plan to mandate masks in schools this fall, but health officials strongly recommend students and staff wear face coverings if they aren’t vaccinated against COVID-19, the Department of Health’s chief medical officer said. That and other recommended steps are essential to protecting children and ensuring a successful school year as students return to classrooms, Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said. Some of Ohio’s largest districts, including Columbus and Cleveland, already decided to require masks for everyone when the school year begins. Others are still navigating the complicated decision-making and polarization around mask rules as the delta variant spreads and cases rise. The health department is strongly urging school employees and eligible students age 12 and older to get vaccinated. That is the best protection, Vanderhoff said. Health officials also are recommending schools continue additional measures that have proven helpful, such as keeping extra distance between people indoors, improving ventilation, sanitizing and encouraging good hand-washing.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTaft: A state prison inmate serving a sentence for escape was recaptured less than five hours after escaping a minimum security prison in eastern Oklahoma on Saturday, according to the State Department of Corrections. Robert Youngblood, 41, was taken into custody about noon after escaping the Jess Dunn Correctional Center in Taft about 7 a.m., according to a statement from the department. The department said Youngblood was seen by staff leaving the prison grounds on foot. The department said Youngblood was serving time for escape from a Logan County jail. DOC records showed Youngblood’s previous convictions included drug possession and distribution, false personation, obstructing an officer and robbery.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Rescue teams continued their search Sunday for a Salem climber who plummeted several hundred feet while descending Mount Jefferson on Friday. The \"intense\" search for Steven Vanpelt, 33, was in its third day after Marion County Sheriff's deputies initially responded to a call from the Pamelia Lake trailhead just off Oregon Highway 22 at 11:36 a.m. Friday. Linn County Sheriff’s Office took over command of the operation at about 3:30 p.m. that day. Linn County officials said Vanpelt was descending Mount Jefferson when he fell \"among extreme mountainous terrain.\" A witness told deputies they lost sight of Vanpelt after he plummeted several hundred feet. Vanpelt has not yet been found because of the dangerous terrain consisting of snow, cliffs, large boulders, crevices and rock scree, which calls for technical mountaineers, officials said. Search-and-rescue efforts on and near the mountain often require multiple counties because of the resources needed and county borders in the area. Corvallis Mountain Rescue, Eugene Mountain Rescue, Deschutes Mountain Rescue and Portland Mountain Rescue are helping with the efforts, Linn County Sheriff's Office authorities said. LifeFlight crews and the Army National Guard have also conducted multiple flights to search the terrain in the days following the initial report.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTredyffrin Township:A Republican candidate for governor has denied he caused an accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike last week in which a Bradford County motorcyclist was killed. Charlie Gerow, 66, was involved in an accident Wednesday night in Chester County. A highway construction worker told Spotlight PA that he saw a car later identified as Gerow's traveling on the other side of the turnpike with a motorcycle wedged into its grill. State police closed the turnpike for 7 hours after the accident. No charges have been filed. The Chester County coroner’s office said the victim was Logan Carl Abbott, 30. The cause of death was multiple blunt impacts and toxicology tests on the victim are pending, Chester County Coroner Christina VandePol told the Associated Press. Gerow’s campaign posted a statement to its website on Friday that said he is “cooperating fully with the investigation and will continue to do so.” The statement said Gerow “looks forward to the State Police completing their investigation and is confident that the investigation will confirm that he was not the cause of the accident.” The campaign statement said Gerow has been advised to not discuss the accident until police have completed their investigation. State police released a crash report that did not identify anyone involved, but reported that a fatal crash occurred in the turnpike’s westbound lanes in Tredyffrin Township at about 9:50 p.m. Wednesday. Police said the crash involved a Honda motorcycle and a Mercedes Benz 300. The westbound lanes were closed until 4:45 a.m.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNarragansett: The easing of rules on outdoor dining that proved to be a crucial lifeline for many Rhode Island restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic were extended Monday during a ceremonial bill signing by Gov. Daniel McKee. The law signed outside Meldgie’s Diner in Narragansett puts a moratorium until April 1 on enforcement of municipal ordinances or zoning requirements that would penalize restaurant and bar owners for modifying their premises to allow for outdoor dining. “When something works and makes sense, you continue it,” the Democratic governor said at the ceremony attended by the legislative sponsors of the bill as well as several bar and restaurant owners. “That is what this legislation is all about: allowing these outdoor seating arrangements to continue so we can support small, locally-owned restaurants that have faced numerous challenges since the outset of the pandemic.” Mark Eldridge, co-owner of three Meldgie’s Diner locations, said the challenges of COVID-19 have been “overwhelming,” but his restaurants have stayed afloat thanks to local, state and federal aid programs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: The Spartanburg County Council voted to ends its $25-a-year road fee in the wake of a state Supreme Court decision tossing a similar fee out in neighboring Greenville County. There have been other attempts in recent years to repeal the fee passed in 2005 to pay for road and bridge maintenance, but the high court ruling sealed its fate, County Council Chairman Manning Lynch said. The County Council will need to vote two more times to officially end the fee, the Herald-Journal of Spartanburg reported. The fee generates about $7 million a year and Lynch said he thinks the county can find money in its general budget to replace the fees.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen:A federal contempt of court trial involving three members of the U.S. Marshals Service has been moved from Aberdeen to Sioux Falls, according to court documents. Three supervisory marshals, including the agency’s Chief of Staff John Kilgallon, were accused of allowing a deputy marshal to leave the courthouse in Aberdeen with prisoners in tow on May 10after the marshal refused to tell the judge whether she had been vaccinated against COVID-19. The trial was originally set for Sept. 13 in Aberdeen, but will now begin Dec. 14 in Sioux Falls. U.S. District Judge Brian C. Buescher, who is presiding over the case, said Sioux Falls is a more convenient place for proceedings for all parties involved in the case, the Aberdeen American News reported. U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann, who filed the criminal contempt of court and obstruction of justice charges, has dropped out of the case. Buescher is based in Nebraska. In court documents recusing himself from the case, Kornmann wrote that Department of Justice policies should not trump lawful federal court order and the case “has nothing to do with requiring anyone to be fully vaccinated.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:The Tennessee Department of Transportation said it will likely be early August before the Interstate 40 bridge between Arkansas and Tennessee can reopen to traffic. Contractors are working on Phase 3 of the repairs that began after a crack was found in May in the Hernando DeSoto Bridge over the Mississippi River. Transportation Commissioner Clay Bright previously said construction was expected to run into at least late July. The department said Friday it would have a more schedule information this week about reopening. All interstate traffic in the Memphis area is being diverted to I-55. The 47-year-old, six-lane bridge was shut down May 11 after inspectors found a crack in one of two 900-foot horizontal steel beams crucial for the bridge’s structural integrity.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: Party attendees beat a man to death with bricks early Monday after he opened fire, police said. Another person was shot and killed and three were injured. Fort Worth police were called to the 5600 block of Shiloh Drive about 1 a.m. Witnesses told police that a small gathering was being held in a backyard. One of the attendees became upset and left the gathering before returning with another person. Both started arguing with other partygoers, authorities said. Police did not describe what caused the initial altercation. The party attendee pulled a gun and shot one person, authorities said. The victim was not seriously injured. Other people at the party chased the shooter, authorities said. While the shooter turned and fired at the crowd, a group picked up landscaping bricks and started throwing them at the shooter. The shooter ended up on the ground – it’s not known whether he tripped or was tackled – and continued shooting. One person was killed by that round of gunfire, and another was injured, authorities said. “The shooter was struck multiple times with at least one landscaping brick and was pronounced dead at the scene,” authorities said. Police have not released the identities of anybody involved, nor have they said whether any charges will be filed. A handgun was recovered by police.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The water levels at the Great Salt Lake have hit a historic low, a grim milestone for the largest natural lake west of the Mississippi River that comes as a severe drought grips the region. On Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey announced average daily water levels had dropped about an inch below the previous record of 4,191.4 feet, which was set in 1963. The new record came months earlier than when the lake typically hits its lowest level of the year, indicating water levels could continue to drop further, said Candice Hasenyager, the deputy director of Utah’s Division of Water Resources. Receding water already is affecting a nesting spot for pelicans, which are among the millions of birds dependent on the lake. Sailboats have been hoisted out of the water to keep them from getting stuck in mud.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The city council has postponed a vote on whether to allow people experiencing homelessness to camp in city parks. Late last week, the council discussed a proposed policy looking at the needs of the homeless and the city, including where emergency sleeping would be located when the local shelter is full, WCAX-TV reported. The proposal also addressed what park staff should do if they find someone sleeping in an unapproved location, such as on school grounds, private property or near a public path, the station reported. The goal is to protect the homeless while adding boundaries, officials said. “If the shelters are open and there’s a place for someone to go, and they’re camping in a high sensitivity area, we would ask them to leave that area, so they can go to a shelter that’s more appropriate and safe,” Montpelier Homelessness Task Force staff representative Cameron Niedermayer said. The Homelessness Task Force will be considering suggestions from the public and working with the parks commission before the council’s next meeting on Aug. 18.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Lifeguards in Virginia Beach are warning people against diving into murky and shallow water at the oceanfront in the wake of three people reporting spinal cord injuries this year. Tom Gill, chief of the Virginia Beach Lifesaving Service, told The Virginian-Pilot last week that if “you can’t see what you’re diving into, you shouldn’t dive into it.” Chad Rosenbrock dived into the surf in June and reportedly hit his head. The impact broke several vertebrae. The 46-year-old Navy veteran was paralyzed from the chest down. Virginia Beach saw six suspected spinal injuries in 2020, three in 2019, two in 2018 and seven in 2017. Most injuries are fairly minor. And less than 10% result in paralysis. But doctors say they’re all preventable.\n\nWashington\n\nBainbridge Island:A juvenile male sixgill shark measuring more than 9 feet long washed up on Rockaway Beach, and the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife responded to conduct a necropsy. “It was such a surprise to me,” said John Keller, who lives next to Mackenzie. “I fish out here and have fished out here a long time. I’ve never believed or even thought that there were sharks in the water other than dogfish. I’ve been out salmon fishing, I’ve caught more than my share of dogfish, but to see something like this … that’s just an amazing critter out here in this water.” Lisa Hillier, a biologist with the state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, was among those who examined the shark and found that the shark was killed after ingesting fishing gear, with lead weights and hooks. The shark was the third to wash up on a beach in the region this year, she said. “We do get washups occasionally, sometimes one or two a year. Having three is not unusual, but let’s just hope that it stops there,” Hillier said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSouth Charleston: Coupon books are now available offering discounts on lodging, dining, activities and merchandise at West Virginia state parks.

DPI officials concluded that the Cedarburg School District failed to establish enough facts to make any determinations and ordered the district to launch a new investigation. According to the DPI decision, parent Jessie Mchomvu filed a complaint with the district in October alleging her bi-racial child heard another high school student praise Kyle Rittenhouse and vowing to drive a vehicle through a Black Lives Matter protest. Rittenhouse, who is white, shot and killed two people during a protest over police brutality in Kenosha last August. He’s set to stand trial in November on homicide charges. Mchomvu also alleged that her child frequently heard a racial slur for Black people in the hallways, students displayed Confederate flags on their vehicles and wore clothing with messages supporting police and Donald Trump. The district hired an outside investigator to look into the complaint. The investigator determined there was no evidence of racial harassment or bullying after interviewing Mchomvu and one district employee. The district adopted the investigator’s conclusion.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A recently retired U.S. senator from Wyoming remained hospitalized in uncertain condition Monday, three days after a bicycle accident outside his hometown.

Non-essential “Telework Able” employees should telework.\n\nUnsheltered residents are to call 211 for info on the closest warming center and for help accessing a shelter through a coordinated intake process, the email said.\n\nFranklin’s snow emergency, which began shortly before 5:30 a.m. Friday, will go through 6 p.m. Saturday, according to an email from Franklin Police. No street parking is allowed during this period, the email said.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nHow much snow is the Friday storm expected to bring to the Milwaukee area?\n\n\"It's gonna be another tricky storm,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Ben Miller said Thursday. \"Not similar to the last one, but given the warm Lake Michigan temperatures and the warm December we had, it could impact snow totals again near the lakeshore.\"\n\nWith temperatures around freezing during the day, the lakeshore communities, especially to the south, could see a wintry mix or even rain during the day.\n\nAreas along the lakeshore, though, should still see 3 to 6 inches on the ground.\n\nWe'll update this file with the latest on the winter storm and the situation around Wisconsin with snowfall totals, school closings, road conditions and any power outages.\n\nFor those farther away from the lake, even by just a few miles, temperatures also around freezing could create wintry-mix conditions during the day, but they should see snow even into the afternoon. He said any wintry mix will change back to snow quickly. The inland communities are forecasted to get 5 to 10 inches with some pockets getting 10 to 12, Miller said.\n\nHow much snow will the rest of Wisconsin get?\n\nEastern, northeastern and central Wisconsin are expected to get between 6 and 12 inches of snow from the storm, according to the National Weather Service in Green Bay.\n\nThe areas along the Lake Michigan shoreline are expected to get the most snow, closer to 8 inches.\n\nFurther north and in north central Wisconsin, the snowfall amount tapers off.\n\nSome of the biggest snow totals in the state are expected in south central and southwest Wisconsin. The National Weather Service in La Crosse projects much of the area, including Madison, to get between 11 and 18 inches. La Cross is expected to get 9 to 15 inches.\n\nThe snow Friday will bring an arctic blast and below zero temperatures\n\nThe snow will bring with it the first arctic blast and below-zero temperatures of the season. That weather comes into the area Friday night and into Saturday. Temperatures will slowly drop on Saturday and into Sunday when they fall below zero, Miller said.\n\nSunday, Monday and Tuesday will see highs in the single digits and lows below zero. That could be the case on Wednesday and Thursday. Regardless, temperatures are expected to be in the high teens or lower single digits or below zero the rest of the week.\n\n\"It's going to come in and stick around for a while,\" Miller said. \"The longer we go into the season with above-normal temperatures, the bigger the shock it's going to feel like when it finally decides to dip.\"\n\nWhere can I find the latest Wisconsin winter weather road conditions?\n\nCheck out the the 511 WI website for the latest traffic updates and any road closures across Wisconsin.

The new plates are for the Alabama Poultry Foundation, Sickle Cell Awareness and Troy University, according to AL.com. Also available on Feb. 1 will be an Alabama Audubon “Protect Our Birds” tag. Most of the proceeds of the tag - $41.25 of its $50 cost – will go to Alabama Audubon to support bird conservation. Discontinued are the Rotary International, Civitan International and Square/Round Dancing plates.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Police are investigating vandalism at a Russian cemetery in Sitka. Police are investigating vandalism at the Russian Cemetery. About 20 headstones were knocked over or damaged and Russian Orthodox crosses were broken and left the ground, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. Police were informed of the vandalism Friday by the cemetery’s caretaker, Bob Sam, who had last checked the cemetery a week before. Wooden crosses were destroyed, numerous cement headstones were pushed off their bases, statues on top of headstones were toppled and glass vases were broken, Sitka Police Department spokesperson Serena Wild said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Phoenix Public Transit Department has received a $920,000 grant to manage the planning of 11 stations along a 5-mile streetcar route that would connect four activity centers in Mesa. The money from the Transit-Oriented Development Planning grant will be used to conduct extensive planning efforts, determine design guidelines and establish economic strategies, according to Mesa officials. The route would connect Riverview Marketplace, Asian District, Fiesta District and downtown Mesa when it’s completed, the officials said. The Valley Metro Tempe Street Car Project was allocated $17.4 million last June under the American Rescue Plan to advance the 3-mile streetcar plan with 14 stations and six vehicles.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A University of Arkansas professor pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about patents he had for inventions in mainland China. Simon Saw-Teong Ang pleaded guilty in federal court in Fayetteville to one count from a 58-count federal indictment. Prosecutors said 24 patents bearing Ang’s name were filed with the Beijing government but that he failed to report the patents to the university and denied having them when questioned by the FBI. The university requires disclosure of all faculty patents, which the university would own. The plea deal called for a one-year prison sentence, but the crime could be punishable by up to five years in prison. The 64-year-old Fayetteville resident was suspended from the university faculty when he was initially indicted in July 2020. The university website no longer lists him on its faculty directory.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The descendants of Native American tribes on the northern California coast are reclaiming a bit of their heritage that includes ancient redwoods that have stood since their ancestors walked the land. Save the Redwoods League planned to announce Tuesday that it is transferring more than 500 acres on the Lost Coast to the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The group of 10 tribes that have inhabited the area for thousands of years will be responsible for protecting the land dubbed Tc’ih-Léh-Dûñ, or “Fish Run Place,” in the Sinkyone language. Priscilla Hunter, chairwoman of the Sinkyone Council, said it’s fitting they will be caretakers of the land where her people were removed or forced to flee before the forest was largely stripped for timber. The transfer marks a step in the growing Land Back movement to return Indigenous homelands to the ancestors of those who lived there for millennia before European settlers arrived. The league first worked with the Sinkyone council when it transferred a 164-acre plot nearby to the group in 2012. The league recently paid $37 million for a scenic 5-mile stretch of the rugged and forbidding Lost Coast from a lumber company to protect it from logging and open it to the public.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Student enrollment has continued declining across Colorado public schools, with the state counting about 1,200 fewer students in kindergarten through 12th grade this fall than last year, when enrollment in preschool through high school plunged by about 30,000 students. State officials largely attributed last year’s enrollment slump – which was the first of its kind reported in more than 30 years – to parents’ pandemic-driven decisions. Many held off on enrolling kids in preschool and kindergarten and other families switched to homeschooling or online education programs. And the Colorado Department of Education, which on Wednesday released enrollment numbers from a count conducted in October, expected that enrollment numbers would increase again within the next few years. But the dip in K-12 students this year points to an underlying issue that has nothing to do with the pandemic: declining birth rates. Declining numbers could spell financial trouble for some school districts, because district budgets are largely determined by pupil counts.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Three Connecticut breweries have closed or announced closings within the last month because of the pandemic, and a fourth announced it is leaving its current space and assessing options for the future. It’s a blow to an industry that has been thriving in the state in recent years and it reflects a nationwide trend. Sales of craft beer dropped more than 9% in 2020, according to the Brewers Association. Brewery owners told the New Haven Register they faced challenges from an overall decline in taproom business to having to comply with the state’s post-lockdown requirement that they also serve food. 30 Mile Brewery, which opened in 2016, announced it is closing recently on its Facebook page. Better Half Brewing of Bristol closed on Dec. 31 and Shebeen Brewing Company in Wolcott also is closing its taproom, the Register reported. Taproom sales are especially important for small breweries that might not be able to make enough money from selling their products wholesale, William da Silva, a founder of Derby’s Bad Sons Beer Co., told the Register.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Surf-fishing permits for 2022 will got on sale starting Feb. 1 after a nationwide supply chain disruptions pushed back the sale dates, which are usually around the winter holidays, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said. Sales for surf-fishing permits will begin at 10 a.m. Feb. 1, and annual passes for the Delaware State Parks will go on sale at 10 a.m. Feb. 15. The annual passes allow visitors to access the parks for the entire fee season from March 1 to Nov. 30, and surf-fishing permits allow people to drive onto designated sections of Delaware State Parks beaches for fishing. An annual pass costs $35 for a Delaware registered vehicle and $70 for an out-of-state vehicle. A Delawarean can get an annual surf-fishing permit for $90, and an out-of-state angler can get it for $180. First-time permit holders must also obtain a surf-fishing plate on which they will affix their surf-fishing permit decal. Beyond drive-on beach access, the decal grants entrance into the other state parks without paying the daily entrance fee.

Keepers at the National Zoo’s small mammal house reported for duty on Jan. 4 to discover Beatrix had given birth overnight. Now 2 weeks old, zoo staff said the prickly little one is doing well. The porcupette has bonded with its mom and is nursing well and gaining weight, keepers said. “Our team is looking forward to learning if the newborn will take after Beatrix, who is relaxed and easy-going, or be more active and curious like Quillbur,” the zoo said in a social media post. It’s not known whether the new bundle of spiny joy is a boy or a girl. Newborn porcupettes look anatomically similar until they are about 6 months old, staff said. Keepers sent quill samples to scientists at the Zoo’s Center for Conservation Genomics for DNA analysis. They should know the newborn’s sex in a few weeks. Quillbur and Beatrix gave birth to their first offspring back in 2019, soon after Quillbur came to the National Zoo. After a naming contest that year, the son was named Quilliam. Quilliam and this newborn porcupine are the fourth generation of this family to live in the small mammal house\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville:Data released by the International Shark Attack File said Florida ranked No. 1 in the world for unprovoked shark bites in 2021. Florida had 28 unprovoked bites last year, compared to 19 in the rest of the U.S. and is consistent with Florida’s most recent five-year annual average of 25 attacks. Of Florida’s 28 unprovoked bites, 17 were in Volusia County, which includes Daytona Beach. Researchers with the ISAF, which is a division of the University of Florida’s Florida Museum of Natural History, scour media reports for news of shark bites, include reports from field researchers and verify with medical personnel the veracity of the information. “Unprovoked attacks” are defined as incidents in which a live human is bitten in the shark’s natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark, according to the report. “Provoked attacks” occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way, including spearfishers, divers that harassed or tried to touch sharks, people that tried to feed, unhook or remove sharks from a fishing net.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGriffin: A pastor has denied he was holding people against their will in an unlicensed group home. However, police have charged Curtis Keith Bankston and his wife, Sophia Simm-Bankston, with false imprisonment in connection with the operation. Police said the couple at times locked as many as eight people in the basement, seizing control of their finances. Police said earlier this week city firefighters responded on Jan. 13 to a report of a person having a seizure at the location and found people were in a deadbolted basement, with paramedics climbing through a window to reach a patient. Police said they found the residents were all mentally or physically disabled and the Bankstons also controlled their medications and had denied medical care to residents. Dexter Wimbish, Curtis Keith Bankston’s attorney, told local news outlets on Thursday that his client hadn’t committed a crime. Police said the couple disguised the home as a ministry of Bankston’s church called One Step of Faith 2nd Chance. Investigators said the couple locked residents in the basement during parts of the day. Police said all the residents were moved to new homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: A reinforced fence has been installed around Kahului Airport on Maui after a deer blocked a runway earlier this month. Vinyl fencing now overlaps an existing wood fence surrounding the airport to prevent deer from squeezing through, Maui District Airports Manager Marvin Moniz told The Maui News. The added barrier installed for an estimated $100,000 will prevent a “small kitten” from getting through, Moniz said. Workers also cut brush growing along the fence to make it less appealing for hungry deer, Moniz said. Tens of thousands of invasive axis deer roam Maui. At one time, up to 700 axis deer were spotted around the perimeter of the airport fence, Moniz said, but that number has since reduced to about 300 as they move more north seeking greener pastures and water. Deer herds have also trampled trees and brush around the Molokai Airport. Gov. David Ige recently extended through March 7 an emergency disaster declaration for Maui County so the state can take measures to reduce and control the deer.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin asked legislative budget writers for $29,000 in taxpayer money to cover legal fees incurred after she lost a public records lawsuit. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. McGeachin lost the lawsuit, with the judge saying she acted in “bad faith” in denying access to the public documents. He ordered her to release the records and pay the Idaho Press Club’s legal fees, which came in just below $29,000. McGeachin hired a private attorney to represent her in the case rather than using the Idaho Attorney General’s office. That work cost her an additional unknown amount in legal fees, but she told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee on Wednesday she was still “auditing” that bill, the Idaho Statesman reported.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man known as the “Dreadhead Cowboy” has pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in connection with a rush-hour horseback ride he took along Chicago’s Dan Ryan Expressway in 2020. Adam Hollingsworth pleaded guilty Friday to aggravated animal cruelty and was sentenced to a year in prison by a Cook County judge, court records showed. With credit he earned while on electronic home monitoring as his case was pending, Hollingsworth could be released from the Cook County Jail as early as Monday. Hollingsworth was arrested in September 2020 after disrupting traffic on the Dan Ryan Expressway while galloping his horse, Nunu, amid rush hour traffic in an act of civil disobedience he said was intended to draw attention to gun violence against children. Hollingsworth’s ride resulted in extensive delays on the expressway, with traffic backed up for miles. Officials initially said the horse was so severely injured by the 8-mile ride on asphalt that it might have to be euthanized, but Nunu was later reported to have significantly recovered.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A historic barn that once housed elephants and tigers from well-known circuses and now is home to the International Circus Hall of Fame museum is in need of emergency repairs. Bob Cline, treasurer of the nonprofit hall of fame, said volunteers discovered in December that a main beam supporting an upper wall of the structure had rotted completely and given way, the Kokomo Tribune reported. The barn was built in 1922 by the American Circus Corporation. It is among several structures located east of Peru, in northern Indiana, that once served as the winter quarters for the world’s largest circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. The hall of fame has been working for years to preserve the structures. Cline said the $4,200 to repair the barn’s beam is just the “tip of the iceberg” of what needs to be done. The group is seeking donations to help cover costs for the project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The Red Bull Soapbox Race – an extreme soapbox derby for adults – will make its Iowa debut this summer. Red Bull promotes several extreme sports to publicize its energy drink line and give consumers “wings.” Its soapbox race is similar to the traditional version for children in that carts coast downhill, but the Red Bull Soapbox Race challenges “the most fearless, fun-loving and foolhardy teams to prototype and create the wackiest of rides” using homemade carts, according to its website. Sponsors include West Des Moines-based Hy-Vee and Ankeny-based Casey’s. Casey’s plans to set up a committee that will look for the best “hometown racers” celebrating where racers are from and what they love about Casey’s. Winning hometown racers will receive free Casey’s pizza for a year. The Des Moines event will take place June 18, with the course running along East Walnut Street just south of the state Capitol, from East 12th to East 7th streets. Those interested in entering a cart for the race can apply now.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Clipeez salon is catering to the needs of children and parents, with child-friendly salon chairs that look like firetrucks, airplanes and more. Owner Amanda Rice, who has been a stylist for almost a decade, said she has dreamed of opening a business like Clipeez since she was in beauty school. Rice said she has learned tricks over the years to help children feel at ease while getting their hair cut. With two children of her own, she knows haircuts can be a stressful experience for some children. Rice’s small customers also are greeted with a play area that includes a chalkboard wall for drawing, child-sized tables and chairs, and a variety of toys and activities to keep them busy while they wait. Although Clipeez is a child-focused salon, Rice said customers of all ages are welcome. Parents can schedule a haircut for themselves, knowing their child will be entertained during the appointment. Rice is the only stylist taking appointments at Clipeez but is in the process of hiring additional help. She said she hopes to add five to six stylists to her team so Clipeez can offer walk in appointment options in the future.\n\nKentucky\n\nLivermore: This city in western Kentucky has become certified as the 25th trail town in the state, officials said. Livermore in McLean County received its certification from the Kentucky Department of Tourism, officials said in a statement. The tourism and economic development program provides a strategic plan for communities, which commit to sharing outdoor opportunities, culture, history and stories with visitors looking for adventure, the Kentucky Department of Tourism said. Livermore offers paddling on the Rough and Green rivers and cycling on three new routes, officials said. “There are thousands of miles of trails and waterways throughout the commonwealth,” Department of Tourism Commissioner Mike Mangeot said. “These trail towns offer the perfect destination for long-distance adventures or day trips and we are excited to have Livermore join the other 24 destinations who have received this designation.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A worker on a crew replacing corroded grating on an oil platform wasn’t wearing his safety lifeline when he fell to his death off Louisiana in May 2020, the federal offshore safety agency said. The man stood on grating after he and another worker had cut through its metal crossbars so it could be removed in sections, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. He died after falling 50 feet. The job safety plan said such cutting, called ripping, should be done in sections but the crew “proceeded to rip the entirety of the work area,” weakening it, according to the report. Workers had set out the safety gear called a self-retracting lanyard but didn’t put it on, the report said. The rig operator and the man’s supervisors also contributed to the accident, the agency said. The man was not identified. His employer, Fluid Crane and Construction Co. of New Iberia, had no comment. The rig’s operator, Fieldwood Energy LLC, is reorganizing under a bankruptcy court administrator. Its website shows only the administrator as a contact. Neither the administrator nor Fieldwood’s bankruptcy attorneys responded to emails requesting comment.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine wildlife managers will soon start accepting applications for the 2022 moose hunt, which will follow a year in which hunters had limited success. Tens of thousands of hunters typically apply for a spot in the state moose permit lottery. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said it will start accepting applications in February. The lottery typically happens in June and then the hunt is in the fall. The wildlife department said 68% of hunters killed a moose during the 2021 hunt. That was the third-lowest success rate in the four-decade history of the modern hunt, the Bangor Daily News reported.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:New housing in Ocean City is scheduled to be built at Philadelphia Avenue and Dolphin Street. On Friday, SVN Miller announced that Dolphin Street Development has purchased the corner parcel and plans to build 22 “upscale townhomes” on the property. Dolphin Street Development Owner Jeff Thaler isn’t a stranger to Ocean City development and has completed numerous projects in the area. SVN Miller’s release did not say when construction would begin. This announcement came a month after the Ocean City Town Council approved conceptual plans to build workforce housing between Somerset and Dorchester streets.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMethuen: The city’s first female firefighter has been promoted to captain after a state board ruled in her favor, saying she was passed over for a promotion because of her gender and favoritism in the department. City officials approved Tracy Blanchette’s promotion to captain of the Methuen Fire Department at the request of Fire Chief Tim Sheehy, The Eagle-Tribune reported Friday. The promotion followed the Civil Service Commission’s ruling in November that stated Blanchette was passed over for a promotion from private to captain because of her gender. According to Blanchette and witnesses who testified before the commission, the department fostered an environment of “mutual back-scratching employment culture” among male firefighters. The commission also ruled that Blanchette receive back pay at a captain’s salary dating back to February 2019, when she was passed over for the promotion. Blanchette also filed a sexual discrimination suit against the city in November 2020, seeking $2.75 million in damages, the newspaper reported.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Clair Shores: It’s rusty and no longer needed, but a 165-foot water tower still has fans in a Detroit suburb. St. Clair Shores City Council member David Rubello wants to save the tower, which stands at the city’s golf course, The Macomb Daily reported. The tower was built in the 1920s to improve water pressure in the community but now is obsolete. To some, it’s a local landmark that deserves love. “I hate to see any part of the history of St. Clair Shores destroyed,” Rubello said. “If the people of our community can come together and save this tower, that would be amazing and a win.” He has proposed finding a company that would pay to repair it in exchange for placing advertising on the tower. It could cost roughly $400,000 – 10 times the cost to demolish it. Tall structures can be converted into wireless phone towers, but the area appears to be covered. “It has become part of the landscape. Sadly, demolition looks to be the proper choice,” said Chris Rayes, community development and inspections director. The council voted to table the issue for six months.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A state appeals court on Monday issued a mixed opinion in a complicated case contesting one of the key permits that a St. Paul-based company needs to build what would be the state’s first copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed a decision by regulators to issue the PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It now goes back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to determine whether any pollution discharges from the mine into groundwater would violate the federal Clean Water Act. However, the three-judge panel rejected several other arguments from PolyMet’s opponents. Among them, there was a demand for more stringent limits on the treated wastewater that’s discharged from the mine and a call for a contested case hearing to gather more evidence and testimony on certain aspects of the permit before a neutral judge, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Parts of Mississippi’s capital city have had little or no water pressure in recent days because of broken pipes and problems at a water treatment plant. Areas with higher elevation in south Jackson have been most affected. Problems started Thursday after a major water main broke, and other water lines have broken since then, the Clarion-Ledger reported. On Monday, low water pressure forced four Jackson public schools to have classes online instead of in person and students from four elementary schools were sent to other campuses. City engineer Charles Williams told news outlets he expected crews to make significant progress in restoring service this week. “We are seeing improvements and will continue to see those improvements over the next couple of days,” Williams said during a news conference Monday. “We just ask for patience from our residents. We know they’re frustrated with this, especially in south Jackson.” Multiple pipes broke when temperatures dropped below freezing. The city had problems with a membrane system at a treatment plant, which delayed the crews’ ability to fully restore water pressure to all residents, WAPT-TV reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: Eastern Missouri prosecutors have refiled a felony terrorist threat charge against a man accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people while he was dressed as the Batman villain known as The Joker. St. Louis County prosecutors refiled the charge Friday against Jeremy Garnier, 50, of University City, a day after a judge dismissed the case because prosecutors could not produce a key witness for the grand jury, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Garnier was arrested in March 2020 in a University City restaurant in the midst of his livestream. In it, prosecutors said, he was dressed as The Joker and ordered a soda in the restaurant, saying: “I can’t be inebriated when I’m planning on, you know, killing a bunch of people.” Garnier’s costume and alleged threats were reminiscent of a 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in which 12 people were killed and dozens injured during the showing of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Shooter James Holmes, who was dressed as The Joker during the shooting, received multiple life sentences after a jury couldn’t agree unanimously on a death sentence.\n\nMontana\n\nRonan: The Flathead Water Compact officially got in gear managing one of the Flathead Indian Reservation’s most valuable assets, water rights on the 1.3 million-acre reservation. On Thursday, four new board members took their seats and outlined the rules for granting, managing and enforcing the water rights, which include drinking-water wells, irrigation water, river flows, wetlands, high-mountain lakes, and some of the reservoir behind Hungry Horse Dam. “This is a landmark day for the tribes and the state,” board member Teresa Wall-McDonald said. “With continued cooperation, we can work through any challenge that presents itself.” The CSKT Tribal Council appointed Wall-McDonald, head of the Tribal Lands Department, and Tribal Services Director Clayton Matt to the board, the Missoulian reported. Gov. Greg Gianforte appointed geologist Roger Noble and attorney Ken Pitt. Their first job was to pick a fifth member, which they agreed to choose from a list of five people put forth by the CSKT and governor’s office, at their next meeting. The U.S. Interior Department will also appoint a sixth, nonvoting member to the board. The second, and much larger, task is to set up staff to redo all the previous water rights and get future allocations going. That includes hiring a lead water engineer and a team of five technicians, along with record-keepers and other staff.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Contract talks between the biggest freight railroads and unions that represent 105,000 employees are headed to mediation this week after the unions declared an impasse following more than two years of negotiations. The unions said Monday the contract talks had deadlocked because the railroads are still seeking concessions, even after workers remained on the job throughout the pandemic and endured significant staff cuts in recent years as the railroads overhauled their operations. Michael Maratto, general counsel of the National Railway Labor Conference that represents the railroads, said it is routine for federal mediators to get involved in contract talks, and the railroads welcome their help in reaching an agreement. The NRLC group is negotiating on behalf of more than 30 railroads, including Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Kansas City Southern. Since 2017, the major freight railroads have collectively cut more than 20% of their staff as the industry adopted a new operating model called Precision Scheduled Railroading. It calls for running fewer, longer trains with a mix of freight to reduce the number of crews and locomotives needed to deliver millions of tons of goods nationwide. Unions have said the widespread cuts have spread employees thin, raising concerns about whether defects that could cause derailments will be missed during inspections or allowed to linger in the rail network because routine maintenance has been delayed.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Hard Rock International, owners of the Mirage Hotel & Casino, said it plans to demolish the property’s iconic volcano as part of a major renovation plan, KLAS-TV reported. Hard Rock International Chief Executive Officer Jim Allen confirmed plans to rebrand the resort and get rid of the entire front area. A guitar-shaped hotel will take over, according to a recent rendering. MGM Resorts International, the previous owner, said in a statement it will license The Mirage name and brand to Hard Rock for the next few years while the rebranding process continues. Some are not happy with the decision to do away with the volcano. An online petition on change.org to save the Mirage volcano had gathered more than 1,500 signatures as of Monday.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A flock of 10 loons rescued on frozen Lake Winnipesaukee was released Monday into the Atlantic Ocean. WMUR-TV reported the 10 adult loons trapped on Lake Winnipesaukee were rescued Saturday by members of the New Hampshire’s Loon Preservation Committee. “It could just be that they stuck around a little bit too long because the lake was still open, the fishing was good, and then they molted those flight feathers and as the water started to come in it was too late for them to be able to leave,” said the committee’s Carolyn Hughes. Loons commonly spend the summer and fall months on inland lakes where they breed and raise their young. Loons typically spend the winter on the ocean. The birds were examined on Sunday and found to be in good health.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has tapped Sarah Adelman, the acting head of the state Department of Human Services, to become the commissioner of the state agency. Murphy said Adelman has successfully led the department since taking over on an interim basis in January 2021. She stepped in after Commissioner Carole Johnson left Murphy’s Cabinet for the Biden administration, where she was tapped to oversee COVID-19 testing. Adelman previously served as a deputy commissioner at the department, overseeing a number of divisions, including one that oversees NJ FamilyCare, which is the state’s program to provide health care for children and lower-income residents. She also has served on the board of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, and before joining the Murphy administration was an executive at the New Jersey Association of Health Plans. The Human Services Department is one of the state’s biggest agencies, with 7,400 employees and a $20 billion budget, which includes state and federal funds. Adelman’s nomination is subject to confirmation by the state Senate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Two COVID-19 testing sites that were not on the list of facilities approved by state public health officials have closed indefinitely. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office said in a statement it will investigate the Illinois-based operator, Center for COVID Control. The operator ran roughly 300 testing sites nationwide, including one in Santa Fe and one in Albuquerque. According to its website, sites are closed so that all staff can undergo more training. Center for COVID Control has been riddled with allegations, including falsely billing the federal government for tests for people who had health insurance, falsifying test results and being unhygienic.\n\nNew York\n\nLake George:Ice Castles, a new winter attraction in Lake George that features a wintry playground of tunnels, slides and sculptures all made from ice, opened Sunday. In early December, ice artisans began growing and harvesting icicles to create the frozen attraction that is expected to draw tens of thousands of visitors. Each day, they harvested and hand-placed up to 10,000 icicles to build the acre-sized winter experience. About 25 million pounds of ice went into the creation. The frozen playground includes ice-carved slides, tunnels, fountains, crawl spaces, caverns, and intricately carved ice thrones. At night, color-changing LED lights embedded in the ice create a beautiful glow. Tickets, which range from $15 to $27 a person, are on sale at www.icecastles.com/new-york.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources said a record 22.8 million visitors entered the system’s 41 parks, recreation areas and natural areas in 2021, WRAL-TV reported. That’s a 15% increase from the 19.8 million visitors in 2020, when visits surged as more people sought outdoor activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Jockey’s Ridge State Park was the most visited park in 2021 with more than 1.8 million visitors, about 100,000 fewer than in 2020. The second-most frequented park, Jordan Lake State Recreation Area, saw the largest growth, up 84% from the nearly 877,000 visitors in 2020. Falls Lake State Recreation Area came in third and saw 46% growth last year. Nearly 1.5 million people traveled to the Wake Forest location, up from the 1 million visitors in 2020.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Officials said a produced water spill at an oil well near Watford City Sunday was the result of vandalism. North Dakota Oil and Gas Division officials said valves were opened on the location, leading to a spill of more than 18,000 gallons. Most of the wastewater had been recovered by vacuum trucks, officials said. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It’s a byproduct of oil and gas development. A state inspector has been to the Abraxas Petroleum Corp. site and will monitor the cleanup.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio has settled an environmental lawsuit with Volkswagen over the company’s 2015 emissions scandal for $3.5 million, state Attorney General Dave Yost said. As that scandal unfolded, the automaker was found to have rigged its vehicles to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests. and ultimately paid more than $33 billion in fines and settlements. The Ohio Attorney General’s Office also sued the company, alleging Volkswagen’s conduct – affecting about 14,000 vehicles sold or leased in Ohio – violated the state’s anti-air pollution law. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in June the federal Clean Air Act did not preclude Ohio from seeking its own compensation against Volkswagen. In November the U.S. Supreme Court turned away Volkswagen’s appeals. In settling the lawsuit, Volkswagen did not admit liability. “This agreement fully resolves Ohio’s legacy claims and puts this matter behind the company as we focus on building a future of sustainable mobility,” Volkswagen said in a statement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Cherokee Nation Film Office has unveiled plans for a new incentive program offering up to $1 million in annual funding for productions filmed within the Cherokee Nation in northeastern Oklahoma. The 7,000 square-mile Cherokee Nation spans all or parts of 14 Oklahoma counties: Adair, Cherokee, Craig, Delaware, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Nowata, Ottawa, Rogers, Sequoyah, Tulsa, Wagoner, and Washington. The specialized film incentive is devised to generate economic development and jobs in the Cherokee Nation, as well as to help Oklahoma’s burgeoning film industry continue to grow, the tribe announced Tuesday in a virtual news conference. Plus, the new incentive will provide additional funding for employing Native American citizens and using Native-owned businesses. It is billed as the first tribal film incentive program in the United States. The tribal film office will begin accepting applications for the tribe’s film incentive on March 1. The base incentive offers a cash rebate for qualified production expenses. Prequalified productions filming anywhere in Cherokee Nation are eligible for the rebate.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Supreme Court has OK’d a proposal that would give would-be lawyers the option to skip the bar exam and instead become licensed to practice law through experience or supervision. The state’s highest court in a unanimous vote “expressed approval in concept” to two alternative pathways designed for law students and postgraduates seeking admittance to the state bar, according to draft minutes from the court’s Tuesday business meeting. The court disbanded a previous task force and ordered the Oregon Board of Bar Examiners to convene new committees to further develop the proposals, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Brian Gallini, dean of the Willamette University College of Law, said one proposed alternative would allow Oregon law school students to become licensed attorneys after completing a standard curriculum and likely a capstone project. The other proposed alternative is tailored for out-of-state applicants and would require would-be lawyers to spend 1,000 to 1,500 hours with a licensed Oregon attorney. Many attorneys-in-training would likely continue to take the arduous bar test, as students who score high enough on the uniform exam can be admitted to practice law anywhere in the state.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State authorities said Scranton has been removed from a program for financially distressed municipalities after three decades. The Department of Community and Economic Development said Tuesday the decision was made after “a thorough review” of city audits and financial data, as well as the record from a November public hearing. Secretary Dennis Davin credited “years of hard work and collaboration” on the part of residents, businesses and others. Scranton was designated as distressed in 1992 under the Municipalities Financial Recovery Act or Act 47 following “years of recurring deficits, ineffective financial management practices and unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic trends,” the department said. State officials credited the mayor and city council for working together to help the city “prepare and follow realistic budgets and find ways to improve services while cutting costs.” Monetization of the sewer authority also provided funds to address pension shortfalls and pay off punitive loans, officials said. Officials said Scranton is the 16th municipality to exit the Act 47 program enacted in 1987 to provide fiscal management oversight, technical assistance, planning and financial aid to municipalities experiencing severe fiscal distress.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has reached a settlement of more than $114 million with an opioid manufacturer and three distributors, most of which will go directly to fighting the crisis and helping people with addiction, state Attorney General Peter Neronha said. The settlement includes $21.1 million from Johnson & Johnson and an additional $90.8 million from AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, he said at a news conference. The money is an addition to a $2.6 million settlement reached with McKinsey & Co. last year. Rhode Island’s settlement is separate from a $21 billion global settlement proposed for other states. Rhode Island was not satisfied with how much it would have received under the global settlement and did better this way, Neronha said, noting the state did better than other New England states that signed onto the global settlement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is considering whether to sign into law a bill that would make it easier for businesses that recycle plastic by melting it to open in the state. The bill passed both chambers of the General Assembly on Thursday after a group of House and Senate lawmakers worked out a compromise. Supporters said recycling plastic this way is a safe business and good for the environment because it reduces trash in landfills. Opponents of the bill said melting plastic to recycle it is an unproven industry and it’s not enough to require firms that use the technique to pay a bond to promise to clean up any excessive pollution for five years after the law goes into effect. The five-year bond requirement was a compromise after the bill’s original three-year requirement stalled the proposal in 2021. A spokesman for the governor said McMaster is reviewing the bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A state House committee approved a proposal to prod school districts to use most of their boost in state funding for teachers’ salaries. The Republican-dominated committee approved the bill on an 8-6 vote, sending it to debate on the House floor. Lawmakers were also considering whether to approve a historic 6% boost in state funding for schools to keep up with inflation. In recent years, South Dakota has been trying to climb up the rankings of states with the lowest average teacher pay in the country. But even as a 2016 sales tax hike channeled more money to school districts, South Dakota’s average teacher pay has remained among the lowest in the nation. Republican Rep. Hugh Bartels is championing the bill, which would extend for three years a requirement that came with the 2016 tax plan. It would require school districts to use at least 85% of their funding increase for teachers’ salaries and benefits. School districts would risk losing funding if they don’t at least match average teacher compensation from 2017, but they could also apply for a waiver if they fail to.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Security officers at Tennessee’s major airports found more than 280 guns in passengers’ carry-on luggage in 2021, a significant increase from prior years, officials said. The 283 guns found last year at security checkpoints in airports in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga and the Tri-Cities area surpassed the 162 weapons discovered in 2020 and exceeded the total of 181 guns found in 2019, Transportation Security Administration spokesman Mark Howell said in a news release. Nashville International Airport led with 163 firearms found in 2021, more than the total found at the other four airports. The TSA screened about 10.7 million departing travelers at the five airports, an 88% increase over the number screened in 2020, the news release said. Travelers face criminal and civil penalties for bringing firearms to a security checkpoint. Guns can be transported on a commercial aircraft only if they are unloaded, packed in a locked, hard-sided case and placed in checked baggage, the TSA said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:An 812-acre fire that ignited Jan. 18 and caused at least 250 families to flee from their homes in central Bastrop County after officials said a prescribed burn in Bastrop State Park grew out of control, was 100% contained Monday night, the Texas A&M Forest Service said. “The fire received beneficial rainfall today,” the forest service said Monday. Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape told the Advertiser on Friday that the fire management team’s strategy going into the weekend was to let the fire burn itself out within its footprint and to maintain security around the fire’s perimeter.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar Hills: A teenager was seriously injured in a sledding accident just as health officials were giving out helmets and warning of the sport’s potential hazard’s at a nearby safety event. The accident – at a popular sledding site known as “the Bowl” in American Fork Canyon south of Salt Lake City – came as doctors in the area have reported more serious sledding accidents and a doubling in head injuries, KSL-TV reported. The 16-year-old injured on Saturday was airlifted to a hospital in stable condition after receiving a serious cut to the head. Medical workers and first responders nearby had been seeking to raise awareness about safety and encouraging the use of helmets.\n\nVermont\n\nElmore: The city is asking the U.S. Postal Service to renew a contract with a local store to retain an outpost where people can collect their packages and mail. The post office at the back of The Elmore Store serves fewer than 1,000 people and could close as early as February, New England Cable News reported. The store was taken over by new owners at the beginning of January, according to its Facebook page. In a statement, the Postal Service told New England Cable News: “The business that runs this unit has recently been sold and the Postal Service is in the process of negotiating a contract with the new owner. If there is any change to service there, Post Office Box customers will be given advance notice.” If the post office closes, free mail delivery would be available to residents, but some do not want their packages left outside in the weather, or for other reasons prefer to rent a post office box at the store.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: A newborn husky stolen from an eastern Virginia pet salon has been found and reunited with her mother, but the dogs’ owner said two more puppies from the litter of six are still missing. Bandi Murdock, who owns the dogs and the Critter Cleaners pet salon in Hampton, said the female puppy was returned Sunday, the Virginian-Pilot reported. The six puppies were stolen from the pet salon early Friday, but three were recovered quickly. Hampton police announced Saturday a homeless man had been charged with breaking into Critter Cleaners, animal larceny and other crimes in connection with the theft of the puppies, each about 2 weeks old. Officers and the business owner said someone entered through a window and took money and the puppies early Friday. There was surveillance video. Police found two puppies in the home of an acquaintance of the suspect, according to Murdock, who said she reimbursed a woman who returned a third dog she bought for $100. On Sunday, a woman contacted police to report that her boyfriend bought the fourth puppy and she wanted to return the puppy to her owners, Murdock said. Officers met the woman and Animal Control checked the puppy. Murdock said she and her husband gave the woman a $100 reward, then rushed the puppy to her mother, Nala. “Everybody’s doing great,” Murdock said of the recovered puppies and their mother. “They were all very hungry, but they’re all doing good.” The puppies must be nursed by their mother until they’re at least 4 weeks old, so it’s critical to return them to Nala, Murdock said. Anyone with information about the remaining two puppies is asked to contact Hampton police.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Flights departing and arriving at Paine Field in Everett were canceled Tuesday morning, as foggy weather and new 5G restrictions hampered the airport’s operation. The Seattle Times repotred all commercial flights out of the small airport were canceled on Monday. On Tuesday morning, the first four outgoing flights were also canceled, according to flight trackers, as were the morning’s first arrivals. Alaska Air, whose regional carrier Horizon Air is the only commercial airline operating out of Paine Field, warned that cancellations could continue for several days and was offering some accommodations to affected travelers. Ticket-holders can reschedule their flights for later this week at no additional cost, or try to reschedule their trips to depart from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed limitations on low-visibility flying to avoid 5G interference with cockpit instruments. That has created a problem specific to the Embraer E175 regional jets that operate out of Paine Field and to certain airports, including Paine Field and Portland International Airport.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Signaling an eagerness to diversify its energy offerings, coal-dependent West Virginia would eliminate a ban on nuclear power plants under a bill that passed the state Senate on Tuesday. The bill was approved on a 24-7 vote. Three senators did not vote. A similar bill is pending in the House of Delegates. The state’s ban on nuclear plants was enacted in 1996, but nuclear power has in recent years gained support as a tool to keep climate change under control, with proponents noting that it emits few planet-damaging emissions and is safer on average than nearly any other energy source. “All this bill does is simply says we’re open to discussion. That’s it,” said Kanawha County Republican Sen. Tom Takubo, the bill’s sponsor. “We’re not close-minded. “I think it’s important for West Virginia to be looking forward to the future, looking forward to diversify, and simply say to the rest of the world we are open for discussion should this technology come to our mountain state.” West Virginia is the nation’s second-largest coal producer, behind Wyoming, and accounted for 5% of the nation’s total energy production in 2019, ranking fifth among the states, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But West Virginia has lost thousands of coal jobs in the past decade as companies and utilities explore using other energy sources such as natural gas, solar and wind.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans who control the state Assembly were set to approve bills Tuesday that would require employers to count a prior coronavirus infection as an alternative to vaccination and testing and prohibit vaccine passports. Both measures would face a likely veto from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The governor last year vetoed a GOP bill that would have barred public health officials from requiring people get vaccinated. Republican backers maintain natural immunity is at least as effective as being vaccinated. Similar bills passed in Florida and Arkansas last year. A number of Wisconsin medical groups, including the Wisconsin Medical Society, oppose the measure, arguing vaccination is the best way to protect against COVID-19 and it’s not known how long natural immunity lasts. Data from the state health department showed unvaccinated people are hospitalized at a rate nearly 11 times higher than fully vaccinated people. No groups have registered in support the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming’s first Black sheriff last year fired a white deputy who is accused of tormenting a Black subordinate for years with racist name-calling that led him to quit, a new federal lawsuit revealed. Albany County Patrol Sgt. Christian Handley once drove past and yelled a profanity and the N-word at Cpl. Jamin Johnson while Johnson and his wife and children were walking out of their home, according to one example of racism alleged in the discrimination lawsuit filed last week. “Mr. Handley later apologized for having not realized that Mr. Johnson’s family was present, as if his vile racism was otherwise acceptable,” the lawsuit said. Johnson is suing Handley, seeking a jury trial if necessary and damages for the years of racism that he said led up to his decision to quit in 2017. The allegations put a new spotlight on the sheriff’s office in Laramie, the Albany County seat known for the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, a crime that drew unprecedented attention to LGBTQ rights and hate crimes. The racism allegations came after Sheriff Aaron Appelhans’ appointment as Wyoming’s first Black sheriff in the wake of an outcry in Laramie over a deputy’s 2018 shooting of an unarmed man who had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Handley used racial slurs to refer not only to Johnson but to Black citizens he came in contact with on the job, including four University of Wyoming students who were in a vehicle he once pulled over, according to Johnson’s lawsuit against Handley, filed Jan. 18 in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne. The suit didn’t provide the reason for the stop. Handley declined to comment when reached by phone and asked about the lawsuit Monday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/29/heat-relief-tiny-veterans-homes-unearthed-bones-news-around-states/117294388/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nSelma: Preservation work has begun on the historic Brown Chapel AME Church, the 113-year-old church that played a pivotal role in the fight for voting rights. Gov. Kay Ivey, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell and other officials attended the groundbreaking ceremony Thursday in Selma, The Selma Times-Journal reported. The National Park Service has provided a $1.3 million grant for the church’s restorations and repairs. Brown Chapel was built in 1908. The restoration work will include electrical work, roof work and cupola repairs. Sewell said the grant will “ensure that America’s story lives on.” The church and its members played key roles in the marches that helped lead to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The church was the site of preparations for a 1965 march that became known as Bloody Sunday after marchers were beaten on Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge. The event galvanized support for the passage of the Voting Rights Act. The church was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997, and it is still in use today. “The love of Brown Chapel AME Church will forever be shared by our state to the world, to be a representative of doing the right thing even when it can be dangerous,” Ivey said\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: If people want to testify at city council meetings in Soldotna, they will have to do it in person from now on. The council decided last week it would end the city’s use of Zoom conferencing, the Peninsula Clarion reported. Like many governmental bodies, the city began using Zoom as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Soldotna paid just over $3,000 for a Zoom subscription, which included a video webinar that could host up to 500 participants. The City of Seward said in April it would no longer offer Zoom for meetings, but the City of Kenai and the Kenai Peninsula Borough still use Zoom. In a memo to the city council, Soldotna Mayor Paul Whitney said the need for video conferencing had decreased. Whitney also said during last week’s meeting that the council will return to regular seating.\n\nArizona\n\nLake Havasu City: An Arizona State University nursing program, set to debut at the school’s Lake Havasu City campus this fall, seeks to put a dent in the state’s nursing shortage. ASU Havasu, which is still a young campus at 9 years old, got approval in April from the Arizona Board of Nursing to offer a 12-month bachelor’s of science degree in nursing. The program is expected to draw more than 30 new students, the Today’s News-Herald reported. Anita Harger, the chief human resources officer at Kingman Regional Medical Center, said she has never seen such a dearth of nurses in her 30-year career. It’s a worry for most hospital administrators across the region, she added. Hospitals in rural areas also find it hard to compete with regional hospitals or private medical practices. Amanda Goodman, a spokeswoman for Arizona State University’s Edson College, is hopeful the class of future nurses will consider planting roots. Nurses who get their education in rural areas are likelier to stay in there after graduation.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture Cooperative Extension Service recently issued a notice on Japanese beetles. Looking like miniature June bugs, Japanese beetles are becoming an annual nuisance. Nearly every year, about mid-June, adults appear, feeding on various ornamental plants. In the landscape, that’s most often roses, crape myrtles, hollyhocks and several others, but they will take advantage of whatever they can get. Large populations will defoliate plants seemingly overnight. Adults can be controlled with malathion, carbaryl (Sevin) and pyrethrin. The better option might be to try to control the grub stage of the beetles that will occur next year. After this year’s adults feed, they will lay eggs that will hatch this fall and over the winter as white grubs in the soil. This is often in the lawn near the host plants that the adults feed on. Because the newly hatched grubs feed on grass roots, applying a lawn grub control product, such as GrubX, that contains the active ingredient imidacloprid in late June and into July will control the grubs and break their life cycle. For information, call (870) 425-2335.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Delta is now the variant of the coronavirus identified third-most often in California, according to new data – underscoring that the variant is highly contagious, a danger to people who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Delta variant now makes up 14.5% of California coronavirus cases analyzed in June, up from 4.7% in May, when it was the fourth-most-identified variant in California, according to data released by the California Department of Public Health. Experts said the Delta variant poses a greater chance of infection for unvaccinated people if they are exposed to this version of the virus. The variant, first identified in India, might be twice as transmissible as the conventional coronavirus strains. The Delta variant has been responsible for the rise in cases recently in India, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. But vaccinated people are well-protected against infection and illness from the Delta variant. One recent study found that the full course of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (two doses) was 88% effective against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant and 96% protective against hospitalization. There is no widespread scientific consensus on whether the Delta variant is more likely to cause more serious illness than other conventional strains. Delta’s rise comes as California’s currently dominant strain, Alpha, first identified in the United Kingdom, might have peaked.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Easing the notorious rush-hour gridlock on Interstate 25 south of Denver will require controlling thousands of motorists’ access to the highway with fraction-of-a-second precision never before seen in Colorado. It’s why in the next few weeks, state transportation officials will launch the Smart 25 Managed Motorways Pilot Program, using what’s called “coordinated ramp metering” on a 14-mile stretch of northbound I-25 between University Boulevard in Denver and Ridgegate Parkway in Lone Tree. Many entrance ramps on metro Denver highways have traffic lights to control traffic flow but they aren’t programmed to respond to real-time conditions. By making constant and minute changes to the length of time cars wait on entrance ramps before merging onto the highway, traffic engineers believe slowdowns and logjams can be greatly reduced – or avoided altogether. The proof, according to Colorado Department of Transportation Smart 25 Project Manager Zach Miller, resides nearly 8,800 miles away in Melbourne, Australia. “Australia has figured out how to use algorithms to resolve complex traffic problems to prevent congestion,” Miller said. “I am hopeful this technique can be beneficial to CDOT as well.” What Australia’s second-largest city found after implementing its coordinated ramp metering program on a stretch of the M1 freeway a decade ago is impressive: The number of vehicles getting through increased by 25% during peak commuting periods, travel speeds improved 35% to 60% during peak periods and crashes went down by 20% to 50%.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Opioid deaths spiked in Connecticut during the pandemic and continue to increase in 2021, fueled by continued disruptions to recovery programs and a deadly, fentanyl-laced drug supply. The synthetic opioid fentanyl, which is 80 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, was found in 4% of accidental intoxication deaths in the state in 2012 but showed up in the vast majority of fatal overdoses last year, the Hartford Courant reported. The isolation brought on by the pandemic led to more drug use, more emergency room visits and more overdoses. The state Department of Public Health reported the number of overdose deaths in the first three months of 2021 was higher than the same period in 2019 and 2020. Some recovery programs stopped offering treatment or support groups, exacerbating the difficulties.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:U.S. Sen. Tom Carper revealed recently that he was sending his old minivan out to pasture, opting for a much younger and sportier red Model Y Tesla, which has all-wheel drive, 20-inch induction wheels and an all-black interior. Nothing lasts forever. Not even a 2001 Chrysler Town & Country minivan. In all, the Silver Bullet logged an estimated 535,000 miles. “Whether it’s your first car or some other car, I think everybody has a vehicle for which they had just a real attachment, a lot of affection or maybe even just gratitude because of what it carried them through,” Carper said. The reach of Carper alumni is vast in Delaware politics. Many are now high-ranking communication aides or elected and appointed officials. Upon hearing the news, former drivers, who consider themselves to be a part of an unofficial fraternity, immediately texted one another. The thought of getting lost while driving the van or it breaking down on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge still makes some break out in a sweat. “It’s the most famous prop in Delaware history, right?” joked Mat Marshall, a former driver who estimated he drove miles 340,000 to 390,000.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said that all DMV service centers will return to walk-in service starting July 19, WUSA-TV reported. DMV officials said that they will honor all appointments made through July 7, but none will be available after that date. In addition, two DMV locations will have special weekend hours to accommodate residents. In-person service becomes available on a first-come, first-serve basis at Adjudication Services starting July 19 and at all DMV Service Centers starting July 20, Bowser said in a release. “As DC DMV transitions away from ‘appointment only’ service, the agency notes that residents can still make appointments for any available or canceled appointments through July 17,” Bowser said. Scheduling road tests for commercial and noncommercial driver’s licenses will remain by appointment only, Bowser said. Additionally, the mayor states that D.C. residents can take advantage of “special weekend hours” for in-person services at the DMV’s 95 M Street SW location and Inspection Station between 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, July 11 and July 18.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis said Florida is sending 50 state law enforcement officers to Texas to help enforce the U.S.-Mexico border, though it remains unknown what their mission will be and who will be paying for the effort. “We are unable to share mission specifics at this time to protect the security of the missions they are working,” said Katie Strickland, a spokeswoman for the governor. DeSantis said funding the mission has also not been determined. “That is still a point of discussion,” DeSantis said. “Typically, if someone would help us, you know, we would pick up some of their funding and so that is how we would hope that it goes. But we do not anticipate getting any federal funds.” DeSantis’ focus on the U.S. border comes as Republicans across the country are using immigration to attack the Biden administration. As part of that effort, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the U.S. border Wednesday with about a dozen House Republicans. The governor, who is positioning himself for reelection in 2022 and is widely believed to be considering a run for the White House, said Friday that he might try to make a trip to the U.S. border himself.\n\nGeorgia\n\nClarkston: Researchers at Georgia State University will use a $500,000 grant to try to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates among refugees and other groups in Clarkston – one of the largest refugee resettlement communities in the U.S., the university announced. The money from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will help train and deploy six outreach workers to address residents’ concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and encourage them to get vaccinated. The workers will represent major refugee groups living in Clarkston, including the Burmese, Congolese, Afghan and Somali communities, as well as the African American community, the university said in a news release. The school plans to use workers who are known and trusted in their respective communities and send them out within a month, Michael Eriksen, a public health professor at Georgia State who is leading the effort, said. Thousands of refugees live in the Clarkston area.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health care professionals who care for the medical needs of homeless in Honolulu’s Chinatown neighborhood will be expanding their efforts to other parts of Oahu with a new mobile clinic. Starting in July, the team led by Christina M.B. Wang, of the Hawaii Health & Harm Reduction Center, will take a Nissan van to help homeless people across the Haleiwa and Waianae small boat harbors. They will also go to Central Oahu, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Nessa Vierra, 60, has received COVID-19 vaccinations, a cellphone, bandage kits and repeated offers of help from a walking team in Chinatown. She called the center’s medical mobile outreach across Oahu “one of the greatest things to happen. That’s perfect.” Vierra spends time in her regular spot at River and Pauahi streets, along with dozens of her friends who have been treated by Wang’s team over the years. The van was purchased through a grant from the state Department of Health.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Boise Police Department said 28 people were sickened when an unidentified chemical was spilled at a popular Boise public pool on Friday afternoon. Fourteen people were hospitalized after the exposure, but officials said none of the injuries was life-threatening. Boise Fire Division Chief Paul Roberts said the chemical was “pool-related” and the spill happened at a maintenance building while a commercial truck was filling tanks at the site. Hazardous materials crews were sent to the pool about 1 p.m., and authorities warned people in the neighborhood to “shelter in place” for a few hours because of the risk of respiratory injuries. About 28 people who were at or near the pool reported symptoms, police said. Eleven were treated at the scene and 14 were taken to area hospitals for treatment. Officials were still investigating what chemicals were involved in the spill.\n\nIllinois\n\nGlencoe: A famed horticultural park north of Chicago that has been free to attend for a half-century is about to charge patrons. Starting in January, the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe will start charging visitors on a sliding scale, between about $10 to $26. Jean Franczyk, the garden’s president and CEO, said the decision to charge admission was driven by popularity of the park that before the pandemic drew more than a million visitors a year. “We did a lot of modeling and anticipating and said, ‘OK, how are we going to maintain the quality of programs?’ ” she told the Chicago Tribune. “How are we going to keep up with ongoing maintenance? How are we going to meet this audience demand? And we landed on: One of the things that we could do was revise our admissions policy.” Visitors will catch a break because the cost to park will drop from $20-$30 to $8. And visitors can save money if they plan ahead or visit at times less popular than spring weekends. For example, what the park calls “plan-ahead pricing” means it will cost $9.95 for many days every year. Also, the park will add 52 free days a year.\n\nIndiana\n\nColumbus: Unearthed bones recently discovered at a construction site in south central Indiana are believed to be thousands of years old, according to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Construction workers found the human remains in May while digging at the site of a new Bartholomew County judicial building in Columbus, The Republic reported. Archaeologists from the University of Indianapolis analyzed the bones, determining them to be between 2,000 and 3,000 years old. The bones belong to an adult male, a preteen and an infant, according to the DNR. The bones are thought to be the bones of Native American people of the Adena culture, which existed in the Ohio River Valley as far back as 1000 B.C. The human bones were found roughly 6 feet deep and mixed with animal bones. A different settlement was also found about 2 feet from the surface, consisting of glass, nails and other artifacts dating to the late 1800s or early 1900s. After archaeologists conclude their analysis, the remains will be turned over to Native American tribes for reburial, the DNR said. The county building is still set to open in April 2022, but a monitor will be onsite to oversee further construction to ensure any additional human remains discovered are handled properly.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: The University of Northern Iowa has received its third and largest allotment of federal COVID-19 relief funding, which will provide additional financial assistance to qualifying students impacted by the pandemic during the fall 2021 and spring 2022 semesters. The $10.7 million provided to UNI as part of the American Rescue Plan and Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund III is the most recent round of funding the university has received for its students since the beginning of the pandemic. The university previously distributed more than $7. million in federal funding to students who showed exceptional need because of COVID-19. Undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in the fall semester may be eligible for a portion of the new funding. In order to qualify, students must fill out a 2021-22 FAFSA, which the university is using to help determine individual need. Students who are referred to the office of financial aid and scholarships for HEERF III funding, yet do not meet FAFSA eligibility criteria, will have their applications considered on a case-by-case basis. The award amount will likely range from $1,250 to $1,750 per eligible student. The funding will be made available to qualifying students starting in mid-September. Additional awards are anticipated for the spring semester and will be provided based on remaining available funds.\n\nKansas\n\nLarned: A man has been charged with arson after a large U.S. flag was burned outside a business in Larned, Pawnee County Attorney Douglas McNett said. Jason Wayne Cauble, 37, of Larned was arrested Tuesday. He made his first court appearance Thursday on the felony arson charge, McNett said in a news release. Investigators said the 30-by-20-foot flag was burned in April at the Carr Auction and Realty Inc. building in Larned. McNett said that people who burn their own flags are protected by First Amendment free speech rights but arson can be charged when another person’s property is burned. He said he didn’t have information on Cauble’s possible motive. Cauble remains jailed on $15,000 bond. His preliminary hearing was scheduled for July 8.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Army 1st Sgt. Michael Miller pulled off a surprise reunion with his family Sunday with the help of the Louisville Bats minor-league baseball team. Miller’s children and other family members were at the game to throw out the ceremonial first pitch, only to find out their loved one was behind the plate after he took off a catcher’s helmet. The family sprinted to Miller as soon as they recognized him and shared a long group hug to applause and cheers from the crowd at Slugger Field. Miller had been on deployments since 2017, the Bats said. Gov. Andy Beshear’s son, Will, also threw out a ceremonial pitch at Sunday’s game, and Beshear shared a photo of himself with the Millers on social media.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:Legislation that would have allowed adults to carry concealed firearms without a permit in Louisiana was vetoed by Gov. John Bel Edwards. In a statement from Baton Rouge, Edwards said he strongly supports Second Amendment rights. “But I simply cannot support carrying a concealed carry firearm without proper education and safety training – and I believe the majority of Louisianans agree with me,” Edwards said. He added that anyone carrying a concealed firearm should have “basic marksmanship and safety training.” The bill by Monroe Republican Sen. Jay Morris passed 73-28 in the House and 27-9 in the Senate – wide enough margins to override a veto. But the Legislature is not in session. To consider overriding the veto, members of each chamber would have to agree to hold an unprecedented veto session in July. Pressure for such a session has been building since Edwards vetoed legislation prohibiting transgender athletes from competing on girls’ sports teams in Louisiana schools. Under Louisiana’s constitution, a veto session is automatically scheduled when a governor vetoes legislation. However, a majority vote of either the House or Senate can scrap the gathering. Lawmakers have never held a veto session since the current Louisiana Constitution was adopted in 1974.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government has given Maine a $7 million boost to help prepare for another public health crisis. Republican Sen. Susan Collins and independent Sen. Angus King said the Maine Department of Health and Human Services has received the money from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About $1.8 million is for preventing and controlling emerging diseases and the rest is for preparing and responding to public health emergencies. The senators said the state “must not lose sight of other public health initiatives that protect the health and safety of the community” while it continues responding to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:A plane crashed into Assawoman Bay near the Ocean City airport on Sunday afternoon, according to the fire department. Maryland State Police reported that the plane, which was piloted by Matthew Cortigiani of Utah, went off the runway and into the water shortly before 2 p.m. Cortigiani reported smoke in the cabin as he attempted to shut down the plane’s engine. He then proceeded to try and land the plane at the airport; but it went off the runway and into the bay. An Ocean City Fire Department official confirmed five individuals were on board but suffered no significant injuries and were placed on civilian vessels. One of the occupants was transported to TidalHealth Peninsula Regional for treatment of injuries. Maryland Department of Natural Resource Police and the U.S. Coast Guard also responded to the scene and assisted. The Worcester County Bureau of Investigations and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the incident.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Senate has approved legislation designed to create a more secure egg supply chain and raise the state’s farm animal welfare standards to be on a par with other states. The bill would upgrade Massachusetts’ egg production law – created by a successful 2016 ballot question – to create predictability and certainty by mirroring even stronger national United Egg Producers cage-free guidelines. Supporters of the bill said those guidelines have been adopted by leading retailers, producers, and other states. Massachusetts voters in 2016 overwhelmingly passed what at the time was the strongest law for farm animals in U.S. history, known as Question 3. Since then, retailers, producers, and other states mandated even stronger standards in the shift to cage-free conditions for hens. The legislation passed by the Senate updates existing state law to meet the new standards. The bill has the backing of the animal welfare groups that supported the 2016 ballot question. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House of Representatives\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:Residents in the Detroit area were cleaning up Sunday after flooding in the area overloaded sewer systems, damaged homes and knocked out power for thousands. Bags of trash lined neighborhood streets in suburban Grosse Pointe Farms as garbage trucks made special rounds to help pick up debris, including damaged furniture and bedding. A day earlier, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office declared a state of emergency for Detroit and surrounding Wayne County after daylong rain flooded freeways and streets. Health officials warned of hazardous conditions Sunday amid cleanup efforts and cautioned residents to stay out of flood waters. The Port Austin area on Michigan’s Thumb was also reeling from storm damage, including a suspected tornado Saturday night. There were reports of a badly damaged home, scattered trees and downed power lines, but no major injuries. DTE Energy said roughly 22,000 customers remained without power Sunday. Indiana Michigan Power said crews were also were restoring power for thousands in Michigan and northern Indiana. More than 6 inches of rain fell Friday in parts of the Detroit area, overloading sewer systems. Some streets were completely flooded, and low-lying sections of freeways saw water deep enough to cover car tires and hoods.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Authorities are bracing for an extended wildfire season, saying the typical summer reprieve is looking more and more unlikely. Wildfires are typically at their worst in the spring and fall, slowing in the summer when trees and plants are fully green and rain increases. But more than half of the state is experiencing drought conditions and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expects dry weather to continue through the summer. More wildfires had broken out across the state by mid-June than in all of last year. The state typically has fewer than 1,200 wildfires a year, burning roughly 39 square miles, the Star Tribune reported. So far, more than 1,425 fires have burned nearly 55,000 square miles of forest and grassland, according to the Department of Natural Resources\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The city has received more evidence that its economic outlook is returning to pre-pandemic levels. April’s sales tax collection numbers reported by Mississippi’s Department of Revenue and the city saw a new record set with $1,089,614. The city’s stadium tax for food and beverage and the tourism tax for hotels and motels also increased, The Oxford Eagle reported. The numbers are reported on a two-month delay. The sales tax was 3% higher than March’s revenue and 79% higher than April 2020, which was the first full month of the COVID-19 pandemic, when most businesses were closed or had operations greatly scaled down because of health restrictions. In April 2019, Oxford collected $856,149 in sales tax, which was $233,465 less than this year. The food and beverage tax collected $387,876 in April, a 2% increase from March and 79% higher than April 2020. The tourism tax collected was $48,215 in April, up 34% from March and 347% from April 2020.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Missouri’s rivers are rising, and with heavy rain possible through most of the week, parts of the state are under flood warnings and flash-flood watches. Minor flooding was happening Monday at several points on the Missouri River. Damage was minimal, though several roads and streets were under water. The Mississippi River was nearing technical flood stage from St. Louis south through Cape Girardeau, with crests expected early this week. The rising rivers followed heavy weekend rain – some areas got up to 10 inches of rain. One person died and two others were rescued Saturday when their vehicle became stuck in floodwaters in Clinton County. Forecasts call for occasional storms through at least Thursday in much of the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Legislation aiming to protect businesses from COVID-19 restrictions imposed by local authorities was signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte more than a month ago, but across the state, elected officials, public health officers and attorneys are left with wildly different interpretations of what the new law does. In Bozeman, officials said they will be taking a more hands-off approach to everything from food safety regulations to sanitation requirements at local businesses, as they come to grips with a new law they believe has gutted their ability to enforce even the most basic health rules, the Montana State News Bureau reported. House Bill 257 was part of a stack of bills brought by Republicans during the recent session to address what they saw as overreach by public health officials during the pandemic. The relatively complex measure mainly sought to shield businesses from mask mandates and other instances in which local government comes between them and their customers. The legislation alters the sections of state law dealing with the powers of counties and municipalities to enact ordinances and resolutions. It prevents those actions from denying customers “the ability to access goods or services” or requiring businesses to do so. And in the part of state law dealing with local health board authority, it adds that same prohibition to regulations dealing with communicable diseases that apply to an entire jurisdiction.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Health officials are continuing to work to persuade residents of rural parts of the state, where coronavirus vaccination rates remain low, to get their shots. The Omaha World-Herald reported that vaccination rates in the state’s rural counties tend to lag far behind the rates in the state’s urban counties, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only about 40% of the adults in rural parts of Nebraska are fully vaccinated compared with more than 60% of those living in the state’s metropolitan areas. The state’s most populous counties have some of the highest vaccination rates: Lancaster County has 63% of its adults fully vaccinated, followed by Douglas at 62% and Sarpy at 58%. But 11 of the state’s rural counties have vaccination rates below 25%, including McPherson at 11%, Grant and Logan at 16% and Arthur at 17%. As part of the effort to reach rural areas. two top officials at the state Department of Health and Human Services plan to participate in a forum held by the Center for Rural Affairs on Tuesday. The agency’s CEO Dannette Smith and Chief Medical Officer Gary Anthone will answer questions about the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines during the event. The state has also promoted the vaccines in rural areas through advertisements, other town hall meetings and work with local health officials.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has issued a fire prevention order for all its lands in Nevada, including a ban on the use of fireworks, exploding targets and ammunition with steel components. BLM Nevada Fire Management Officer Paul Petersen said the order runs through Oct. 31. He said it’s necessary because Nevada is experiencing record dry conditions and much of the state is in severe drought. “The current national wildland fire potential outlook indicates that we could be in for a challenge this summer,” Peterson said. “It is important for the public to understand and comply with the fire prevention order to help keep human-caused wildfires from needlessly damaging natural and cultural resources.” The order makes it illegal to burn any explosive materials on BLM lands in Nevada. Several areas in the agency’s Southern Nevada District are subject to additional restrictions prohibiting building campfires, using charcoal barbecues or stove fires and smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMilton: A 32-year-old man was accidentally shot in the head in New Hampshire after the bullet fired by his 8-year-old nephew ricocheted while they were shooting chipmunks, police said. The man was injured Friday in Milton and is expected to recover, the Fosters Daily Democrat reported. Police said a bullet shot by the 8-year-old ricocheted after killing a chipmunk and hit the man in the head. Milton Police Chief Richard Krauss called it a “truly just a freak accident.” “It’s not against the law for anyone to teach a child how to shoot and take them hunting, even at 8 years old,” Krauss aid. “There are kids who learn how to hunt and shoot a lot younger than that.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River:Councilman Daniel Rodrick said he will not be part of a committee set up to review whether Toms River should allow marijuana businesses in town. Rodrick said he will not change his mind about his opposition to recreational marijuana sales, and accused Council President Kevin Geoghegan of violating the state’s open public meetings act, or Sunshine Law, by making appointments to the committee during an executive session. But Councilwoman Laurie Huryk said the appointments were made at a meeting of the township’s land use committee. The committee is tasked with producing a recommendation by the council’s July 13 meeting. New Jersey residents approved legalizing recreational marijuana for adults in a November referendum. In Toms River, 63.7% of voters supported last year’s ballot measure legalizing weed for adults. The council had initially planned to adopt an ordinance barring companies that sell, manufacture or distribute marijuana from operating in town.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Home schooling nearly doubled in New Mexico last year as thousands of parents opted out of virtual learning programs offered in public schools. The unprecedented defection from the public school system is putting a strain on school budgets, which are rooted in student enrollment. Parents with the time and patience to school at home said they love the flexibility of home schooling and have learned how to give their children a more tailored education. “We had no interest in doing virtual learning through a public or charter school,” said Jennifer Fischer, 43, who moved with her partner and two sons from Los Angeles to Albuquerque during the pandemic in August. Raised by school teachers and experienced in teaching media classes, the filmmaker couple were unintimidated by the prospect of teaching their fourth-grade and fifth-grade boys. The number of children registered with the state as home schoolers nearly doubled from about 8,800 before the pandemic to about 15,400 this past school year, according to Public Education Department data. K-12 enrollment was already shrinking by about 1.1% each year following a decade of decreased births and more childbearing-aged people moving out of the state than moving to it.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City:Secretary Transportation Pete Buttigieg was to tour the century-old rail tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey on Monday as a long-delayed $11 billion project to build a new tunnel gains steam. The federal government gave the tunnel project key environmental approvals last month necessary to secure federal grants. That had been a sticking point during the Trump administration, as Schumer and others had accused formre President Donald Trump of purposely delaying the environmental approval for political reasons, a charge administration officials denied. The existing tunnel is more than 110 years old and prone to problems and delays because of aging infrastructure. Saltwater intrusion from Superstorm Sandy in 2012 accelerated the tunnel’s deterioration and forced Amtrak, which owns the tunnel, to embark on costly repairs to keep it functioning reliably. Hundreds of trains and hundreds of thousands of passengers pass through the tunnel a day, and delays can ripple up and down the East Coast between Boston and Washington. Once primary construction begins, the tunnel could take as long as six or seven years to complete. A new tunnel would allow the old tunnel to be overhauled, a process that would take roughly two years, and then returned to use. That could significantly increase rail capacity into and out of New York, though it would require additional tracks at New York’s Penn Station. A plan to expand and overhaul the station is in the early stages.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcean Isle Beach: A shark bit a 7-year-old girl over the weekend at Ocean Isle Beach, according to Mayor Debbie Smith. WECT-TV reported that EMS responded to the scene on Sunday morning and the girl was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening. There were no other sightings of sharks on Sunday and no additional warnings for swimmers, Smith said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Wildlife officials said North Dakota’s spring pheasant population estimate is up 3% from last year, but there is worry that an extended drought could cut into hunting prospects in the fall. “The statewide number might be a bit misleading since we are notably down in the southwest, while most of the state benefited from good reproduction in 2020 and a mild winter,” said R.J. Gross, upland game management biologist with the state Game and Fish Department. Pheasant crowing counts are conducted each spring throughout North Dakota. Observers drive specified 20-mile routes, stop at predetermined intervals and count the number of pheasant roosters heard crowing over a 2-minute period. The number of roosters detected this spring was up in the northwest, southeast and northeast regions. The southwest area, which is generally considered the state’s main pheasant hunting region, was recorded at 18.4 crows per stop, down from 19.6 in 2020, The Bismarck Tribune reported. Drought is causing delayed growth in nesting cover, brood-rearing cover and croplands across the state, according to Gross. Extended drought could prevent insect hatches, reducing food available to chicks.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A volunteer picking up debris Monday morning along the banks of Alum Creek Reservoir in Delaware County found what is believed to be a human leg floating in a plastic bin. The man was in a kayak about a quarter-mile north of Cheshire Road, east of Africa Road, about 8:30 a.m. when he saw the floating tub. “As he got closer, he noticed the lid was slightly ajar and a human leg was protruding from it,” said Tracy Whited, spokeswoman for the Delaware County Sheriff’s office. The man immediately called 911. Investigators with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Delaware County Coroner’s office and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources were on the scene and looking for other evidence, Whited said. Officials did not disclose other details, including what else might have been in the bin. Alum Creek Reservoir is a man-made reservoir that covers about 5 acres and is one of the main raw water supply sources for central Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Oklahomans spent more than $1.5 billion on medical marijuana since it became legal to buy in 2018, according to an analysis of the latest tax collection figures from the Oklahoma Tax Commission. That level of retail means the state collected more than $110 million from the 7% marijuana tax, and another $138 million was levied in state and local sales taxes, according to the most recent data. There were record sales in April, when medical marijuana patients spent nearly $90 million and the state collected nearly $6 million from the marijuana tax and another $7.5 million in sales tax. If the growth continues at its present rate, Oklahoma’s cannabis sector is poised to become a billion-dollar-a-year industry based solely on retail sales. That doesn’t account for the value of farms, distribution and business services offered throughout the industry. This creates a sizable revenue stream for the state.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The city shattered its heat record Sunday, topping out at a sweltering 113 degrees. Temperatures in the city rose to 101 early in the day, and skyrocketed another 10 degrees by 3 p.m., quickly surpassing its record of 108 degrees set in 1981, 1941 and 1927, according to David Bishop, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Portland. At about 4:25 p.m. – and then again at about 5:10 p.m. – the city reached 113 degrees. Temperatures continued to fluctuate throughout the evening, but were still at 109 about 8 p.m., said Colby Neuman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Portland. National Weather Service officials issued an excessive heat warning for much of the Willamette Valley in effect through 11 p.m. Monday, urging the public to stay indoors and hydrate to avoid the potential for heat-related illnesses.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania lifted its mask mandate Monday, more than 14 months after the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf began requiring people to wear face coverings whenever they left home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Department of Health will no longer require unvaccinated people to wear masks in public, though it said businesses, health care facilities, prisons and other places may still require them. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also requires masks on planes, trains, buses and public transportation hubs. Fully vaccinated people were allowed to shed their masks in most public places in Pennsylvania last month. According to federal data, 75% of Pennsylvania residents age 18 and over have received at least one vaccine dose, with nearly 60% of the adult population fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. People are considered fully vaccinated once they are two weeks beyond their last required dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Community College of Rhode Island is holding two COVID-19 vaccination clinics this week in conjunction with enrollment events. The first is scheduled for Tuesday at the Warwick campus, and the second is scheduled for Wednesday at the Providence campus. Prospective students interested in attending CCRI will be able to apply for free, receive assistance with filing for financial aid, schedule or take the placement exam, and register for classes. The vaccination clinics, which will be administering the Pfizer shot, are open to the prospective students and their families. CCRI is requiring all students attending on-campus activities this fall to be vaccinated. This year’s high school graduates can also learn about the RI Promise Scholarship program, which provides two years of free tuition for full-time CCRI students.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGalivants Ferry: U.S. Sen. Tim Scott launched his reelection campaign Monday, arguing in a series of stops across the state that he and other Republicans represent progress and stability for voters in this deeply conservative state. “Sometimes you’ve got to go back to the future, and that’s a future I want to go back to,” Scott said in North Charleston, referencing the accomplishments of the Trump administration, as well as his hope that Republicans can recapture the U.S. Senate majority in next year’s midterm elections. Scott, 55, has said the 2022 Senate run would be his last. The chamber’s only Black Republican, he has become one of the GOP’s go-to standouts, particularly on issues of race and policing. Scott has also begun to be mentioned as a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate, with his name appearing in a straw poll conducted at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference. He also gave the party’s response to President Joe Biden’s maiden address to Congress this year, accusing Democrats of dividing the country and suggesting they’re wielding race as “a political weapon.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Summer camps are back in full swing this year after some limited enrollment or closed completely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Dakota. And at some camps that stayed open and in-person last summer, COVID-19 spread in a matter of days. At Camp Judson in Keystone, the South Dakota Department of Health reported 96 cases by Aug. 3, 2020. Days before, on July 27, the department reported less than 10 cases at the camp. Camp Judson closed its doors to campers that week. This year, though, places such as Leif Ericson, the YMCA’s day camp that hosts campers from ages 4 to 15 in Sioux Falls, is seeing a resurgence of campers in enrollment numbers for its five two-week sessions throughout the summer. The camp is finally back to normal in 2021 after floods ravaged the site in 2019, and after COVID-19 limited enrollment in 2020. Camp director Mike Murphy said the camp anticipated a normal summer in 2020 until mid-March. He capped the capacity at 1,500 last year, kept a waiting list and shortened the duration of the sessions. All the staff wore masks. They also offered a virtual camp option and kept sessions limited from July to mid-August.\n\nTennessee\n\nSevierville: Police said two people face charges after officers found a dead monkey inside a hot car parked outside of a waterpark. According to the Sevierville Police Department, officers last Wednesday found the dead 9-week-old marmoset monkey and a 5-week old monkey that was alive in the car parked at Soaky Mountain Waterpark after the facility’s management notified police. Police said the other monkey was taken to an animal hospital and was very dehydrated but improving. One of the monkeys’ owners is charged with aggravated animal cruelty and the other with animal cruelty. Both are from Indiana. Police said additional charges are possible and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A group of Texans assisting each other in two Facebook groups are suing to prevent Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton from opting out of a COVID-19 pandemic relief program that added an extra $300 to their weekly unemployment pay. Abbott last month said the state was ending its participation in the enhanced benefits as of Saturday, two months before the added payments are to end nationally. Their lawsuit, filed in Travis County, alleged that the Texas constitution does not give Abbott the authority to make this decision alone, but instead requires a determination by the Texas Workforce Commission. TWC is the state agency that processes unemployment claims and pays out benefits. Abbott “exceeded his power” in opting out of the program, according to the lawsuit. It seeks a temporary restraining order to keep the benefits from ending on Saturday. Attorney David Sibley, who is working with the Facebook groups, said the case will be heard Friday afternoon. The two groups, Texas Unemployment Updates and Unemployment Petition and Peaceful Protest, contain more than 30,000 members combined.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Reports of violations of the city’s water-use guidelines have spiked since the city declared a water shortage on June 4 and called for increased water conservation, said Matt Haack, Ogden’s water conservation coordinator. Haack said more than 200 complaints have been received, more than the 100 to 150 that had been reported in all between implementation of the city’s online water-waste reporting form in 2017 and the June 4 declaration, the Standard-Examiner in Ogden reported. The calls have generally been about excessive lawn watering, watering that causes runoff into sidewalks and streets and lawn watering during prohibited times, 10 a.m.-6 p.m., which is the hottest part of the day. So far, the city hasn’t issued any fines, said Brady Herd, Ogden’s public utilities manager, instead focusing on education and providing information.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: A major construction plan at the Fairbanks Museum has been postponed because of pandemic-related pricing and labor and subcontractor shortages, museum officials said. The museum bid out the Science Annex project in the spring and planned to start construction in July until the project came in at $2 million or 68% above construction estimates, the Caledonian Record reported. “We were just honestly stunned to see the costs come out where they did,” Adam Kane, the museum’s executive director, wrote in an email to project donors and supporters on Friday. The museum has decided to postpone construction to early spring of 2022, hoping to drive down costs and do additional fundraising, he said. Kane is also hopeful that the Science Annex will be supported by additional federal funding. The project is designed as a 6,000-square-foot, three-story annex on the rear of the museum that will house hands-on exhibits for astronomy and meteorology. Plans are for it to also provide a future home for Community College of Vermont operations in St. Johnsbury.\n\nVirginia\n\nCentreville: A Virginia man was arrested last week after police said he posed as an officer while trying to force his way into his neighbors’ homes, then fought with responding police officers. WTOP-FM reported that it happened early Wednesday in Centreville, when a 36-year-old man left his home after a domestic incident. Fairfax County police said the man tried to force his way into two of his neighbors’ homes while identifying himself as a police officer. When officers arrived, he was being “held down” by one neighbor, police said in a news release. Once officers tried to detain the man, police said he fought them. The man was arrested and charged with burglary, assault on law enforcement, two counts of destruction of property, simple assault and impersonating a police officer.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: Orchardists in Central Washington are trying to save the cherry crop as a heat wave grips the region, using canopies, deploying sprinklers and sending out workers in the night to harvest cherries. Temperatures are expected to exceed 100 degrees this week, with a predicted high near 115 on Tuesday. The heat wave hit as Washington’s cherries are ripening, the Yakima Herald reported. Cherry growers are moving 500,000 boxes a day, said B.J. Thurlby, president of the Washington State Fruit Commission. So far, the cherries appear to have good color and sugar, he said. This heat wave is a new experience, Thurlby said. “We have not been in these waters before,” Thurlby said. If the cherries get too hot, they will sunburn and dry out, he said. There are strategies to take the edge off the heat. Sprinkler systems under cherry trees can, through evaporation, knock off 10 to 15 degrees from the air temperature around the fruit, Thurlby said. But it’s not a foolproof solution. Shade netting is also another strategy that orchardists use to fight heat and birds. The large polyethylene sheets can knock down temperatures 10 to 15 degrees, as well as prevent sunburn on fruit.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia Chief Justice Evan Jenkins has suspended many of the court health protocols that arose last year from the coronavirus pandemic. Jenkins’ administrative order contained some exceptions. Courts should continue using remote technology when possible for hearings and proceedings, Jenkins’ order said. They should also continue avoiding the use of call dockets to cut back on extended waiting periods in lobbies, common areas and court rooms, he wrote. Protocols for people in prison or jail remain in effect, and hearings for such people should continue to use video conferencing to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in a jail or corrections facility, Jenkins wrote. If circumstances change or a local outbreak occurs, additional steps can be taken.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A plan to develop “tiny homes” for homeless veterans on Milwaukee’s northwest side is proceeding after an important part of the developer’s financing package was obtained. The developer, Veterans Outreach of Wisconsin Inc., has received approval for a $700,000 loan from the Milwaukee Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit business lender affiliated with the city of Milwaukee. That loan will provide bridge financing as Veterans Outreach continues its fundraising efforts to develop up to 48 homes on 7 acres at 6767 N. 60th St., according to MEDC. The Common Council and Mayor Tom Barrett in 2019 approved selling the city-owned site for $35,000. With the MEDC loan, Veterans Outreach plans to complete its land purchase next week and break ground on the project soon after, said Brad Behling, the nonprofit group’s executive director. The rest of the $2.2 million project’s financing is coming from grants and donations. The project’s first phase will include 24 single-family small houses, and a 10,000-square-foot community center with a communal kitchen, showers and offices to host services for the residents. Veterans Outreach hopes to have residents moving in by spring, Behling told the Journal Sentinel. Each house would have 240 square feet.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Plans to rebuild and pave a road will close one of the driving routes into Grand Teton National Park for much of 2022. Moose-Wilson Road connects the communities of Wilson and Teton Village just south of Grand Teton, with the park headquarters at Moose. It’s one of the less busy ways to get into the park in western Wyoming. About 1.4 miles of the 8-mile road is unpaved. Park officials plan to close the road between where it enters the park and the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve in the spring of 2022. They plan to reopen the road on weekends during the busy summer tourist season but close its southern stretch entirely again after Labor Day. The new road’s features will include about 20 vehicle pullout areas. A second phase of work focusing on the road’s northern end will occur in 2024-25, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Each phase costs roughly $13 million. The $26 million has been secured through a federal fund created by the Great American Outdoors Act.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/29"}]}

While it was officially denied by the Kremlin for more than 50 years, it “dramatically changed Ukrainian society and culture, leaving deep scars in the national memory”, writes Serhii Plokhy, the eminent Ukrainian historian.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Ukraine officially declared the famine a genocide in 2006, and has lobbied the international community to do the same. Twenty-four countries have done so, including, in recent months, Germany, Ireland, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nHow did the famine come about?\n\nIn 1928, Joseph Stalin decided that the USSR’s survival depended on rapid industrialisation. His first Five-Year Plan decreed that private landholdings should be merged into collective farms, run on communist lines; increased production would feed factory workers and excess grain would be sold abroad, generating funds for industrial investment. In fact, resistance from the peasantry to land confiscation, along with poor planning, led to smaller yields.\n\nThe Soviets responded by accusing the kulaks (landowning peasants) of sabotage and grain hoarding. They were deemed class enemies, and many were killed or sent to the gulags. When poor harvests led to widespread hunger in the early 1930s, Stalin doubled down, trying to meet optimistic quotas by seizing peasants’ food supplies. The famine devastated grain-producing regions of the USSR: an estimated 5.7 to 8.7 million people died of starvation and linked diseases between 1930 and 1933.\n\nWhy was Ukraine particularly affected?\n\nA quarter of the world’s most fertile soil is in Ukraine, which has been famous as a grain exporter since antiquity. The Bolsheviks relied heavily on its grain, but they also deeply distrusted Ukraine.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution in 1917, an independent republic was declared in Ukraine, and a complex series of vicious conflicts were fought during the Russian civil war, before it became part of the USSR in 1922. As a grudging compromise, the Soviets adopted “Ukrainianisation”: support for its language and a measure of cultural independence.\n\nBut when Stalin targeted Ukraine for rapid collectivisation, many peasants resisted, some violently. The Soviets blamed this resistance, and crop failures resulting from Stalin’s policies, on nationalist feeling: Ukrainian communists and intellectuals were blamed, and the Soviets renewed their determination to extract as much grain as possible from Ukraine.\n\nWhat effects did this have?\n\nThe harvest of 1932 was poor, but state requisition targets were kept very high. When Ukrainian party leaders told Moscow that fulfilling the targets would mean mass starvation, they were classified as enemies and killed or imprisoned. As people began dying in spring 1932, requisitions proceeded, taking what the peasants needed to survive the winter, and even their seed corn for the next year.\n\nIn August, Stalin criminalised taking even a single grain of wheat from a collective farm. Party cadres toured the countryside searching out and confiscating any food as “fines”. Ukrainian peasants were banned from leaving the republic and from travelling to cities. Areas that didn’t meet grain targets were blacklisted, and cut off from the Soviet economy. Mass deaths began, on an almost unimaginable scale, in early 1933; Kyiv and Kharkiv provinces each recorded more than one million deaths.\n\nHow did the world react?\n\nThe Soviets denied throughout that a famine was taking place. A handful of foreign journalists reported on it, but most were successfully discouraged from doing so. Foreign nations made no interventions. Discussion of the famine was forbidden in the USSR until the 1980s, and its memory was mostly kept alive by Ukrainian émigrés, whose accounts of mass starvation – of peasants dying in the streets, and widespread cannibalism – were so horrifying that they were sometimes dismissed as Cold War propaganda. Even the opening of the Soviet archives hasn’t answered every question.\n\nDeath counts, estimated at 3.5 to five million people in Ukraine alone, or around 10% of its population, have had to be deduced because the data was falsified: when the 1937 census revealed drastically reduced population figures, Stalin had the statisticians responsible arrested and shot.\n\nWere Ukrainians singled out for persecution?\n\nCertainly: Stalin imposed the most brutal collectivist policies on Ukraine; he also purged its political leaders, and reversed “Ukrainianisation” by having Ukrainian-language schools and publications closed.\n\nUkrainian farmers elsewhere in the USSR, for instance in the Kuban region of the north Caucasus, were affected more than their neighbours. However, other parts of the Soviet Union, such as Lower Volga and Kazakhstan, suffered comparably.\n\nWas it a genocide?\n\nRaphael Lemkin, the Polish-Jewish lawyer who coined the word in 1944, described the Ukrainian famine as “the classic example of the Soviet genocide”. But under the terms of the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, it possibly doesn’t qualify: there has to be an “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.\n\nAnne Applebaum, in her history Red Famine, argues that the Holodomor doesn’t entirely conform to that. The issue has become deeply politicised: in Russia today, the famine is seen as a “pan-Soviet tragedy” and talk of genocide is regarded as a provocation. Settling the issue is perhaps unnecessary, argues the Yale historian Timothy Snyder. Either way, it is “one of history’s great political atrocities”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/us/philadelphia-rising-covid-cases-no-mask-mandates/index.html", "title": "Philadelphia's Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are climbing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPhiladelphia health leaders warned Thursday that in the past three weeks, reported Covid-19 infections have more than doubled and hospitalizations have nearly doubled as well.\n\n“The entire Philadelphia region is seeing COVID-19 cases rise dangerously,” Health Commissioner Dr. Cheryl Bettigole said in a statement, but added health officials will not be reinstating a mask mandate at this time. “We strongly recommend that every Philadelphian and visitors wear a mask whenever they’re indoors in public.”\n\nThe number of residents testing positive for the virus is as high as it was in the first week of February, health officials said, and roughly 142 people are in city hospitals with the virus – up from 79 three weeks ago.\n\n“The pandemic is not over.

I need more Russian cannon fodder,’” Wallace said. “He is probably going to declare on this May Day that ‘we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people.’”\n\nVictory from defeat\n\nAccording to the i news site, Moscow’s shift to consolidating control over Donbas in the east of Ukraine is linked to Putin’s desire “to tout some tangible military victories” ahead of Victory Day, the “most significant date in the nation’s political-military calendar”.\n\nMarking “the Soviet Union’s triumph over Germany in the Second World War”, the holiday is marked with displays of Russian strength, including “a large military pageant parade through Moscow’s Red Square”.\n\nForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov this week told Italian broadcaster Mediaset that the Russian military “will not artificially adjust their actions to any date, including Victory Day”, adding: “The pace of the operation in Ukraine depends, first of all, on the need to minimise any risks for the civilian population and Russian military personnel.\n\n“We will solemnly celebrate May 9, as we always do,” he said. “Remember those who fell for the liberation of Russia and other republics of the former USSR, for the liberation of Europe from the Nazi plague.”\n\nBut despite Lavrov’s efforts to play down the impact of the ongoing conflict on Victory Day plans, the West should expect to see Putin “rattle some sabres” in the run-up to the military parade, said Forbes’ national security contributor Craig Hooper.\n\n“Ukraine was meant to be a showcase for Russia’s advanced weaponry and authoritarian government,” he said. “But Ukraine has demonstrated that both are hollow.” Moscow’s forces “failed” to seize control over meaningful expanses of territory, while Putin’s “over-reach” has “strengthened global appreciation for ‘rules-based’ order”.\n\nThere is nothing left for Putin but an appeal to “nationalism and Russian nihilism”, he added, suggesting that the events of 9 May will likely be modelled on “Stalin’s playbook” of appealing to the “Motherland” while blaming Russian isolation on the “West”.\n\nPropaganda potential\n\nIn an effort to highlight some success in Ukraine, the Kremlin could order hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war to be put on display during a parade in Red Square, a think tank has warned.\n\nThe Centre for Defence Strategies, which is based in Ukraine, said that 500 captured fighters could be “forced to go through Red Square for cameras”.\n\nBritish fighters currently being held by Russia include Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner. Both were “taken prisoner in the besieged city of Mariupol” and “have since been paraded on Russian state television”, The Times reported.\n\nAndrew Hill, another Brit, “is believed to have been detained by Russia after a video emerged showing a man being questioned on Russian television”, the paper added.\n\nWith less than a week to go until 9 May, Moscow could also “look at places other than Donbas to make a statement”, CNN reported.\n\nAdmission of failure\n\nOptions to mark the event may include “annexing the breakaway territories of Luhansk and Donetsk”, a “push for Odessa in the south”, or declaring “control over the southern port city of Mariupol”.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said this week that the US has “good reason to believe that the Russians will do everything they can to use” the event for propaganda purposes, adding that Moscow has “doubled down” on propaganda “as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield”.\n\nHe continued that it “would be a great irony” if Moscow used the occasion “to declare war”, suggesting that this “would allow them to surge conscripts in a way they’re not able to do now, in a way that would be tantamount to revealing to the world that their war effort is failing, that they are floundering in their military campaign”.\n\nThat the campaign is Ukraine is struggling could also reveal itself through the parade. The Telegraph reported that “fewer soldiers and armoured vehicles will partake” in the event as the “war in Ukraine has weakened the Russian military so dramatically”.\n\n“There will be around 130 military vehicles taking part in the parade,” the paper said, citing Russian Ministry of Defence documents, “compared with 191 last year.” Meanwhile, “around 10,000 personnel will take part, compared with 12,000 last year”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Harriet Marsden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/15/russia-holiday-may-9-ukraine-putin/7309151001/", "title": "Russian holiday on May 9 could signal milestone in Ukraine", "text": "The Kremlin has staged massive shows of strength to mark the day.\n\nThe weeks leading up to May 9 could be pivotal in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of an impending Russian offensive.\n\nAn upcoming national holiday in Russia could be an important milestone in that country's invasion of Ukraine, a war that has been more difficult than the Kremlin anticipated.\n\nMay 9 is Victory Day, marking the Russian defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 at the end of World War II.

So far, so good. Europe claims, however, that the act will hurt its companies selling into the US market. Japan and South Korea have also raised similar concerns.\n\nConsumers can receive a tax break of up to $7,500 for some new electric vehicles (EVs) depending on how many of its components have been manufactured or assembled in either the United States, Canada or Mexico.\n\nSubsidies for car manufacturers who buy US-made parts, including EV batteries, will make it harder for European firms to compete and could divert investment away from the bloc, according to the European Commission. The US plan also offers tax credits incentivizing domestic production of hydrogen and other renewable fuels.\n\nA worker on the Ford F-150 Lightning production line at the Ford Motor Co.

Transatlantic trade hit a record €1.2 trillion ($1.26 trillion) last year, according to the European Commission, which it describes as “a key artery of the world economy.”\n\nWhile China is Europe’s biggest trading partner for goods, when services and investment are included, the United States takes the top spot.\n\nThat partnership has grown ever more important in 2022, particularly for Europe. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, there has been a dramatic increase in shipments of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) across the Atlantic as EU countries have scrambled to replace Moscow’s energy imports.\n\nBut the IRA presents a potentially serious stumbling block. While a trade war is unlikely, the plan is testing the transatlantic alliance and pushing Europe to consider mobilizing its own package of subsidies.\n\nEmployees install cables on a production line at a BMW plant in Leipzig, Germany on October 20, 2022.

Ronny Hartmann/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen criticized the protectionist “Buy American logic” of the plan on Sunday, saying that it could spark a subsidy race between the two sides. A “costly trade war” — which typically involves both sides imposing tariffs on imports — was not in the bloc’s interest, she said.\n\nStill, Georg Riekeles, associate director of the European Policy Centre, is pessimistic about the path forward. The IRA is now law, and there is little appetite to bring it back to Congress to make substantive changes, he told CNN Business.\n\n“It is doubtful answers will be found now in Washington,” he said.\n\nFree trade failure\n\nThe IRA is not the first time Washington and Brussels have butted heads.\n\nIn 2018, former US President Donald Trump slapped a 25% tax on imports of steel from Europe and a 10% tax on its aluminum as part of his “America First” policy that favored domestic industry.\n\nThe move prompted the bloc to impose its own tariffs on some US-made products, including jeans, whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In October last year, both sides agreed to temporarily suspend those tariffs while they attempt to negotiate a deal.\n\nSuch ongoing disputes affect only about 2% of EU-US trade, but a comprehensive agreement at deepening the vital relationship remains elusive.\n\nFor years, the two sides have sought but struggled to introduce a tariff-free system to boost their respective economies. In 2013, under US President Barack Obama, negotiations for the much-hyped Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership began. They ended three years later with no conclusion.\n\nMarianne Petsinger, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, told CNN Business that Europe and the United States had wanted the deal to act as a “counterweight” to China’s growing global economic dominance at the time.\n\nNegotiations stalled over regulations, as well as controversies surrounding the types of products that could appear on Europe’s supermarket shelves, she said.\n\n“To some extent, [the TTIP’s failure] was very much around public opposition [in the EU] over chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef,” Petsinger added.\n\nWhat now?\n\nBoth sides say they want to find compromise.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that he and Biden had “an excellent discussion on the IRA” at their summit in Washington.\n\nThe European Union has a couple of options at its disposal, analysts told CNN Business.\n\nIt could lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organization or respond with its own package of green tech subsidies, or a combination of both.\n\nOn Monday, Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said that the bloc should create its own “European IRA plan,” according to a Reuters report.\n\nUntil now, though, strict EU rules on “state aid” have prevented member states from injecting too much firepower into their domestic industries for fear of distorting the internal market.\n\n“It is their purpose to prevent subsidy races among EU member states, unfair competition and distortions of the EU internal market,” David Kleimann, visiting fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based research firm, told CNN Business.\n\nVon der Leyen said on Sunday that the bloc was prepared to “simplify” its rules to “rebalance” the playing field, which the IRA tilts in favor of the United States.\n\nSuch simplifications are unlikely to “veer into the kind of protectionism” exhibited by Washington, Riekeles said.\n\n“Closing borders is a short-sighted answer to economic crisis,” he added.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/cars/electric-vehicle-boom-bust/index.html", "title": "Electric car startups want to avoid same fate as Britain's 1890s bike ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nAmazon and Ford reported this week they lost a combined $12.3 billion in the last three months due to their investments in electric vehicle company Rivian. The losses dampened hopes that any electric vehicle company will inevitably turn into gold.\n\nEven Rivian, which many automotive experts view as the most promising Western electric vehicles startup, isn’t immune from the boom-and-bust cycle that’s playing out in the electric vehicles market. But experts say this is typical of when new industries arise.\n\nWorkers lower an R1T truck body onto a chassis in the assembly line, April 11, 2022, at the Rivian electric vehicle plant in Normal, Illinois. Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nRivian’s stock has fallen 75% since its initial public offering last year. In November 2021, Rivian was valued more than Ford and GM, but now it’s worth about half as much. Its appeal as a counterweight to Tesla, highly regarded investors and 12-year buildup to production haven’t been enough to protect its stock price from a downturn hitting nearly all electric vehicles companies.\n\nIn 2021, Rivian produced 1,015 vehicles, falling short of its 1,200 target. Its production pace has more than doubled since last year – producing 2,553 vehicles in the first three months of the year – but remains short of what’s necessary to be profitable and justify its lofty valuation. The company is already planning to build a second manufacturing plant in Georgia to complement its Illinois plant, where the existing facility expects to produce 200,000 vehicles a year. Rivian, like many automakers, also raised its prices amid inflation and supply shortages but apologized and rolled back price hikes on existing preorders following customer backlash.\n\nThe challenges have been even worse for other electric vehicle companies that have gone public in recent years. The stock prices of Faraday Future, Lordstown Motors and Electric Last Mile Solutions are all down more than 70% since they went public via SPAC, and all have faced SEC investigations.\n\nSPACs, which have been popular with electric vehicle companies, allow companies without meaningful revenue or proven products to become publicly traded without as much scrutiny as a traditional initial public offering.\n\nUrban Delivery electric vans on the production line at the Electric Last Mile Solutions facility in Mishawaka, Indiana, U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 28, 2021. Taylor Glascock/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe sharp price drops in electric vehicle stocks may be typical of booms and busts. New industries that excite investors with the opportunity to ride a financial rocket into the stratospheres of wealth, but some companies that go public might not otherwise in less enthusiastic times. The 2000 dot com bust is an often-cited example.\n\nAlthough no newly public companies involved with electric vehicles have been convicted of fraud to date, fraud is indeed typical of stock market bubbles, according to William Quinn, a lecturer at Queen’s Management School in Britain who studies stock market bubbles. He pointed to the British bicycle bubble of 1890 when hundreds of new bicycle companies were listed on the stock market at excessive valuations. Nearly all went bankrupt within a few years.\n\nDavid Kirsch, a University of Maryland business professor and co-author of the book, “Bubbles and Crashes,” said he expects some electric vehicles startups to survive but many to fail. “The stories are unraveling,” Kirsch told CNN Business.\n\nThe fates of two electric vehicle companies, Nikola and Lordstown Motors, appeared to take a turn for the worse in 2020 and 2021, respectively, following critical reports alleging misleading and inappropriate conduct from the investment firm Hindenburg Research.\n\nUS electric vehicle companies aren’t the only ones to see their valuations reduced. Chinese electric vehicles startups have taken a hit, too. Nio’s stock has fallen 49% this year, while X-Peng is down 52% and BYD’s has dropped 17%. Even the world’s most valuable automaker, Tesla, hasn’t been immune; its stock down is 27% this year.\n\nKirsch views the falling stock prices of companies that wish to rival Tesla as evident of how difficult it is to turn startups that inspire investors with a story into businesses that prove themselves on paper with revenue and profits.\n\n“Some of these companies are being exposed in a way,” Kirsch said. “There’s a saying, when the tide goes out, you see who isn’t wearing a bathing suit.”", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/01/tech/amazon-union-election-staten-island/index.html", "title": "Amazon workers at New York warehouse vote to form company's ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nAmazon (AMZN) warehouse workers at a facility in New York City have voted to form the first US union in the tech giant’s 27-year history, marking a stunning victory for a bootstrapped effort led by a fired employee.\n\nIn a closely watched election, workers at a Staten Island, New York, facility known as JFK8 voted in favor of forming a union with a newly-established organization called Amazon Labor Union (ALU), which was started by current and former warehouse employees.\n\nThere were 2,654 votes in favor of unionizing and 2,131 votes against it by the end of the second and final day of public vote counting on Friday. Out of approximately 8,325 eligible voters, 4,785 votes were counted and another 67 were challenged. Seventeen ballots were voided.\n\nThe parties have five business days to file any objections.\n\nIn a statement after the vote, Amazon indicated that it is exploring various legal channels to fight the results. “We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,” Amazon said in the statement. “We’re evaluating our options.”\n\nThe staggering result could prove to be a milestone moment for Amazon and the broader labor movement in the United States. The union vote has the potential to upend how Amazon, the country’s second largest private employer, engages with some members of its vast workforce. It could also add fuel to organizing both within the company’s own sprawling empire, where some efforts are already underway such as at an Amazon Fresh store in Seattle, as well as at other companies across the country.\n\nThe outcome was hailed by advocacy groups, large labor unions and the White House, with press secretary Jen Psaki telling reporters Friday that President Joe Biden was “glad to see workers ensure that their voices were heard.” John Logan, professor of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, called the ALU win a “jaw-dropping result.” He added: “There really is no bigger prize for unions than winning at Amazon.”\n\nShortly after the tally was complete, Christian Smalls, the president of ALU who is largely the face of the organization, joined a crowd of other ALU organizers and members of other labor groups that had gathered in downtown Brooklyn to celebrate the win. Sipping from a bottle of champagne and wearing pants emblazoned with the brand name “Billionaire Boys Club,” Smalls gave a brief history of his contentious relationship with the company.\n\n“Two years ago, my life changed forever,” said Smalls, who was fired from his job at the facility in March 2020 after leading a walkout to protest pandemic related health and safety concerns. (Smalls says he was retaliated against; Amazon says he was terminated for violating its policy that required him to quarantine after being notified of a possible Covid-19 exposure.) “I only wanted to do the right thing and speak up for workers behind me,” he said\n\nIn his speech, he also mentioned a widely reported suggestion by an Amazon executive in 2020 to disparage Smalls as “not smart or articulate.” At the time, the executive said his comments were “personal and emotional,” and that he’d allowed his emotions to “get the better of me.”\n\n“It’s not about me. Amazon tried to make it about me from day one,” Smalls said. “It’s always going to be Amazon versus the people and today, the people said they wanted a union.”\n\nAt the gathering, some handed out fliers that read, “Vote Yes For The Union. Despite what Amazon tells you, the union isn’t some outside organization. It’s a legal recognition of our right to have a say at work — as a group instead.” Members of another pro-labor group held a large sign that read: “Amazon and Starbucks: Stop Union Busting! Recognize the union and negotiate now!”\n\nThe results of a separate do-over election at a facility in Bessemer, Alabama were too close to call. A total of 875 workers at the facility voted for joining a union and 993 voted against it, according to the tally, which was also conducted on Thursday. But another 416 ballots were challenged. The National Labor Relations Board expects to hold a hearing on the matter in the next few weeks to determine whether any of the challenged ballots will be opened and counted.\n\nA bootstrapped push succeeds while an established union stumbled\n\nBoth union efforts were borne out of worker frustrations with Amazon’s treatment of workers amid the pandemic and were also motivated in part by increased national attention to racial justice issues and labor rights. But there are key differences between the two.\n\nThe Alabama effort was done in coordination with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), an 85-year-old labor union, which has organized tens of thousands of workers. By contrast, the Staten Island push is not aligned with an existing labor union but rather is trying to create its own.\n\nA demonstrator during the vote count to unionize Amazon workers outside the National Labor Relations Board offices in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S., on Friday, April 1, 2022. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSmalls previously told CNN Business that ALU is running on “pennies compared to other campaigns,” garnering $100,000 in donations raised through pages on GoFundMe, a crowdfunding platform.\n\nHe has sought to differentiate his organizing effort from the one in Bessemer, stating that having an independent union led by current and former employees of the facility “was working and resonated with the workers.” (ALU has also garnered enough signatures for an NLRB election at a nearby Amazon facility in Staten Island later this month.)\n\nThe two union pushes are also unfolding in two very different parts of the country. The RWDSU drive occurred in Alabama, a right-to-work state, where union membership is low. New York, on the other hand, has the second highest union membership in the nation. Amazon’s starting wage for workers of at least $15 an hour also fares differently in Alabama where the minimum wage is $7.25, compared to New York City’s $15.\n\n“They’re enormously important elections. [Amazon] is a company that is not just retail, it is not just logistics, it cuts across almost every sector of the economy,” Logan said.\n\n“I think lots of pro-union Amazon workers will take inspiration from this. There’s nothing exceptional about Staten Island to suggest that you can win at Amazon there but not somewhere else,” Logan said, “All of a sudden, organizing at Amazon no longer seems futile.”\n\nLogan credits the initial RWDSU Bessemer drive one year ago, which was celebrated by a number of celebrities and politicians alike, with broadly creating “energy and enthusiasm amongst young people interested in organizing themselves.” While the results of that election favored Amazon, a do-over was called for after the company was deemed to have illegally interfered. (An Amazon spokesperson called the decision “disappointing” at the time.)\n\nLabor experts have repeatedly said that organizing Amazon workers is an incredibly difficult task given current labor law and the company’s opposition to such efforts. Amazon’s anti-union campaigns included signage inside its warehouses, text messages, and meetings that workers were required to attend before the election periods kicked off.\n\n“In both cases, it’s a David and Goliath situation. They’re up against a very powerful, determined opponent,” Ruth Milkman, a labor sociologist at City University of New York, previously told CNN Business. “In both cases, it’s a very heavy lift because of Amazon’s resources and determination to stamp out any unionization efforts.”\n\nAmazon has previously said its “employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union” and that it is focused on “working directly with our team to make Amazon a great place to work.”\n\nFor more on the biggest and most important technology companies of our time, watch Land of the Giants: Titans of Tech on CNN+.

The Fed last week paused its rate-cutting cycle, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials were \"waiting to see what policies are enacted\" with the new president.\n\nEuropean Central Bank policymaker Klaas Knot said on Sunday he expects new tariffs will lead to higher inflation and interest rates in the U.S. that will likely weaken the euro.\n\nAssuming tariffs contribute to a surge in inflation, the U.S. central bank is less likely to enact the interest rate cuts markets broadly see as catalyzing growth, Capital Economics Chief North America economist Paul Ashworth said in a note.\n\n\"Under those circumstances, the window for the Fed to resume cutting interest rates at any point over the next 12 to 18 months just slammed shut,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/southwest-airlines-service-meltdown/index.html", "title": "Flight cancellations: Why Southwest Airlines is melting down | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nA punishing winter storm that dumped multiple feet of snow across much of America led to widespread flight cancellations over the Christmas holiday.

Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/business/china-digital-yuan-beijing-winter-olympics-mic-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "The Beijing Olympics won't be the splashy launch China wanted for ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN Business —\n\nChina was hoping the Winter Olympics would be a watershed moment for the digital yuan, providing a global stage on which to parade its prowess in financial innovation.\n\nInstead, geopolitical tensions, the pandemic and China’s insistence on stamping out every trace of Covid are spoiling the party, dealing a blow to one of the most ambitious digital currency projects on the planet.\n\nChina is already on the verge of becoming a cashless society, but the vast majority of those electronic transactions happen on privately owned apps, outside of the immediate purview of the state. An official yuan would change that, giving Beijing an unprecedented amount of information about what people are spending their money on and where.\n\nThe world’s second largest economy has been trialing the digital yuan in Chinese cities for the last two years, as it prepares for a national rollout that could put China ahead of Europe and the United States in the global race to develop a state-backed digital currency.\n\nThe timeline for that nationwide launch has yet to be decided, but Beijing almost certainly intended the Olympic Games to be an important milestone on the road to widespread usage.\n\nBeijing has been pressuring businesses — including big Western companies such as McDonald’s (MCD) and Nike (NKE) — to allow customers to use the digital yuan during the games. The digital version of the currency is one of only three payment choices foreign athletes and others have at sporting venues and the Olympic Village, aside from cash and Visa payments. And last year, Beijing said it would make it easier for foreigners to use the digital yuan during the Games by giving athletes ski gloves and smart watches with built-in payment functions, and scrapping a requirement to open a local bank account if they wished to use the currency.\n\nAs the event approaches, though, those efforts may land with a thud. Beijing is barring most fans from attending the Games, and has constructed an elaborate quarantine “bubble” to separate Olympians, officials, journalists and support staff from the rest of the city as fears of coronavirus outbreaks persist. Western lawmakers are also warning their athletes against using the digital yuan over mistrust of the Chinese government, including spying concerns.\n\n“The Olympic Games would have been the first real chance for tourists and Chinese nationals alike to familiarize themselves with the digital yuan, but that door slammed shut when the Chinese government decided to severely restrict the number of Olympic spectators,” said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a DC-based research institute.\n\n“That decision alone, more than anything else, will likely further delay the mass adoption of the digital currency.”\n\nThe digital yuan is one of only three payment choices foreign athletes and others have at sporting venues and the Olympic Village, aside from cash and Visa payments. Visual China Group/Getty Images\n\nA muted international debut\n\nChinese companies and government officials have been touting the Games as an opportunity for the digital yuan in recent weeks, even as it has become obvious that attendance will be minimal.\n\n“Launching the digital yuan at a big party like the Winter Olympics can showcase China’s latest fintech achievement to the world,” Li Xin, chief business manager at Bank of China (BACHF)’s digital yuan unit, told the state broadcaster earlier this month. The state-owned bank is the official banking partner of the Beijing Games.\n\nSeveral factors are making widespread adoption difficult. Authorities have created one of the most complex Covid quarantines ever attempted. Known officially as the “closed loop system,” the restrictions will apply to some 11,000 people from around the world, sealing them off from the wider Chinese population.\n\nAnyone — Chinese or foreign visitor — who isn’t part of that system are barred from attending the Games at all, further limiting the scale of the spectacle.\n\nPolitical tensions could also complicate the situation. Last July, three US Republican Senators urged the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee to forbid American athletes from “receiving or using the digital yuan during the Beijing Olympics.” The committee didn’t publicly respond. But it has reportedly advised US athletes to bring disposable or burner phones to the Olympics in China because of possible surveillance, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, have offered similar advice to their athletes, according to Reuters.\n\nEven if many of the people who do attend the event use the digital yuan, “it won’t make a significant dent in overall transaction levels,” said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe digital yuan is available in 10 cities and regions, but experts cite a lack of incentives as a major reason for flagging enthusiasm. Aly Song/Reuters\n\nStruggling for traction\n\nThe digital yuan is already struggling to gain traction within China. Transactions using the currency totaled just $8.37 billion in the second half of 2021, equivalent to $1.4 billion per month.\n\nWhile that marks some progress following two years of trials, it’s still far from mounting a serious challenge to privately owned digital payment apps.\n\nAnt Group, for example, revealed in 2020 stock exchange filings that its Alipay app processed $1.6 trillion on average each month — more than a thousand times the digital yuan’s monthly transaction volume.\n\nAfter initially limiting usage of digital yuan wallets to winners of a lucky draw, the Chinese government has been making it easier for the public to try the virtual money. At the start of this year, for example, the People’s Bank of China released a wallet app on Apple and Android stores that can be used in 10 cities and regions that are piloting the currency, along with the Olympic venues. That pilot app is now available to everyone in those areas, not just the lottery winners.\n\nThe central bank has touted surging numbers among its trial users last year as a sign of the digital yuan’s success. By the end of December, the app had been downloaded by 261 million individuals, or 19% of China’s population, according to central bank data.\n\nBut there are still barriers to use the money, too. Outside of the Olympics exemption for foreigners, people who want to trade with digital yuan need to download and sign up for the central bank app, and then add money from their accounts at one of the designated Chinese banks.\n\nThe currency also can’t be used outside of the 10 cities and regions that are piloting it, along with the participating Olympics venues.\n\nConsumers appear to have an “unwillingness to embrace” the currency right now, according to Frank Xie, a professor at University of South Carolina Aiken who studies Chinese business and the economy.\n\nExperts cited a lack of incentives as a major reason for the lack of enthusiasm.\n\n“The ecosystems that have been built now for a decade around the big tech firms are unbeatable in terms of network and convenience,” said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow focusing on Chinese financial innovation and technology at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. After all, industry leaders Alipay and WeChat Pay already have hundreds of millions of users who are familiar with their services.\n\n“The payment experience does not tend to strike most users as any different or better than what is already on offer,” he added.\n\nXie also suspected that concerns about a loss of privacy could be a factor, adding that “even ordinary citizens” have come to realize the reach of the government’s power.\n\nChanging spending patterns\n\nThe government does have some options for pushing consumers to change their spending patterns, according to Singleton of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n“Overtime, it is possible people could see increased adoption of the digital yuan to pay for certain expenses, like utility bills, transportation or other government-managed bills, simply because the government could force those changes upon consumers,” he said.\n\nAnalysts have also raised the possibility that the government could request that privately owned apps actively promote the state-backed yuan. That’s already starting to happen: Alipay began trialing digital yuan payments last year, and Tencent said earlier this month that it would also start supporting the digital yuan in its WeChat Pay wallet.\n\n“In effect, you are asking these providers to potentially cannibalize their own systems by allowing customers to use the digital yuan instead of their own existing payment options,” said Kimmo Soramäki, founder and CEO of London-based analytics firm Financial Network Analytics.\n\nThose companies might feel as if they have little option, though. China’s push into digital currency dovetails with its regulatory crackdown on Big Tech. Ant Group and Tencent (TCEHY) have been under intense scrutiny, and were forced to either overhaul their businesses or pay big fines as Beijing sought to curb their power.\n\n“The rollout of future versions of AliPay and WeChatPay [is] likely to be forestalled, which in turn will limit the power wielded by these major tech firms,” said Singleton, who added that the government is hoping that its regulatory hurdles will allow the digital yuan to “overtake these other payment systems.”\n\nHowever, Beijing eventually secures wider adoption of its state-backed digital currency, there does appear to at least be one certainty: The Beijing Winter Olympics isn’t shaping up to be the stage for digital yuan bragging rights that authorities might have hoped for.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/business/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-russia-sanctions/index.html", "title": "Financial sanctions are easier than ever for Russians to evade ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe West’s initial salvo of financial sanctions against Russia failed to deter President Vladimir Putin from launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now the United States is taking a punitive approach, announcing another round of sanctions meant to tighten the screws on Russian banks and “corrupt billionaires.”\n\nBut some experts say those measures, which so far do not target Putin himself, are becoming increasingly easy to evade, thanks in part to a surge of cryptocurrency adoption in Russia.\n\nThe US and EU sanctions rely heavily on banks to enforce the rules. If a sanctioned business or individual wants to make a transaction denominated in traditional currencies such as dollars or euros, it’s the bank’s responsibility to flag and block those transactions.\n\nBut digital currencies operate outside the realm of standard global banking, with transactions recorded on a public ledger known as the blockchain.\n\n“If the Russians decide — and they’re already doing this, I’m sure — to avoid using any currency other than cryptocurrency, they can effectively avoid virtually all of the sanctions,” said Ross S. Delston, an expert on anti-money laundering compliance.\n\nThe US Treasury is well aware of this problem. In an October report, officials warned that digital currencies “potentially reduce the efficacy of American sanctions” by allowing bad actors to hold and transfer funds outside the traditional financial system. “We are mindful of the risk that, if left unchecked, these digital assets and payments systems could harm the efficacy of our sanctions.”\n\nAs Exhibit A, look no further than Eastern Europe, which has one of the highest rates of crypto transaction volume associated with criminal activity, according to research by Chainalysis. Websites used for illicit trades known as darknet markets brought in a record $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2020, most of it in Bitcoin.\n\nAnd nearly all of the growth in darknet market that year can be attributed to one specific Russian-language-only market called Hydra. Hydra is “by far the largest darknet market in the world, accounting for over 75% of darknet market revenue worldwide in 2020,” Chainalysis wrote in a report earlier this month.\n\nOf course, evading sanctions isn’t as easy as dumping all your dollar-denominated funds into Bitcoin. It’s hard to buy anything with crypto, especially big stuff, Delston says.\n\nTake food for example, which Russia historically has imported.\n\n“Is a food exporter somewhere in the world going to accept cryptocurrency that fluctuates every day — every moment of every day — or are they going to want the world’s reserve currency, US dollars?”\n\nA further complication: the oil trade, which makes up a huge portion of Russia’s economy, is denominated in US dollars. To use cryptocurrency to buy anything, you have to have an off ramp to a government-issued currency such as the dollar, says Delston.\n\n“It’s not a complete solution for the Russian oligarchs,” he says, because Bitcoin and other cryptos can be traced on the blockchain. It’s harder, though not impossible, to launder those funds because of the blockchain.\n\nThere are other ways Russia could, at least in theory, mitigate the pain of sanctions by taking a page from Iran’s playbook.\n\nLike Russia, Iran is an oil-exporting country, and it remains under a decades-old near-total economic embargo by the US, including bans on all imports and sanctions on Iranian financial institutions.\n\nBut even as a pariah state, Iran has figured out how to take some of the bite out of sanctions by turning to Bitcoin mining, according to a report by analytics firm Elliptic.\n\nIran has a surplus of energy it can’t export, so it’s using it to power Bitcoin mining, which consumes huge amounts of electricity but rewards miners with payment in Bitcoin.\n\n“The mining process effectively converts energy into cryptocurrency,” writes Tom Robinson, Elliptic’s co-founder. “Iran-based miners are paid directly in Bitcoin, which can then be used to pay for imports” — something Elliptic says has become all but an official policy within the Iranian government.\n\nElliptic estimates that Iran-based miners account for approximately 4.5% of all Bitcoin mining, which would translate to annualized revenue of close to $1 billion.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/energy/us-gas-prices-russia-oil/index.html", "title": "Why are US gas prices soaring when America barely uses Russian ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThere’s pain at the pump for American drivers as US gas prices soar to record highs.\n\nAlthough the United States barely uses Russian oil, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is still a big factor in the gas-price spike — among other reasons.\n\nConfused? We’ll walk you through it.\n\nSo why is Russian oil affecting the US?\n\nMost of Russia’s oil goes to Europe and Asia. But the key here is to think about the oil supply globally, rather than the US specifically. The commodities world is a heavily interconnected one, and oil is priced through a global market. So what happens in one area of the world can affect another.\n\nThe problem at hand is that Russia is one of the world’s biggest oil suppliers. In December, for example, Russia sent nearly 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets, including 5 million barrels of the crude oil that’s used to make gasoline among other items.\n\nAnd yes, it’s true that very little of that Russian supply goes to the United States — just 90,000 barrels of crude oil per day in December, according to the most recent US government statistics.\n\nIn 2021, by contrast, Europe got 60% of Russia’s oil exports and China got 20%.\n\nBut remember that oil is bought and shipped around the world through a global commodities market. So in that sense it doesn’t really matter who specifically is getting crunched by the loss of Russian oil, because lower supply affects those global prices no matter what. And as we know from Econ 101, when there’s less supply of an item in demand, prices rise.\n\nFor example, if Europe buys less Russian oil, it will have to replace it with oil from somewhere else — perhaps from the powerful Saudi Arabia-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. That increase in demand for OPEC oil will send its crude prices higher. And guess who else buys hundreds of millions of barrels of OPEC oil?\n\nYou guessed it: the United States.\n\nWhy is there less Russian supply, anyway?\n\nAt first the West, including the US, exempted Russian oil and natural gas from the sanctions they levied. The Biden administration reversed course on that on Tuesday, banning Russian oil and other fuel imports to the US, while the UK said it will phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. (The EU is in a tougher spot on this, because they’re far more dependent on Russian oil.)\n\nBut the initial lack of formal bans didn’t really matter in terms of prices anyway. There’s been a de facto ban on Russian oil since the invasion began, with most of the country’s supply sitting unsold.\n\nThat’s because oil traders are incredibly nervous to touch the stuff. There’s a ton of uncertainty about buying Russian oil, whether it’s about the ability to close deals given the sanctions on Russia’s banking system, or finding tankers willing to go to Russian ports amid shipping dangers in the war zone.\n\nAs a result, the main type of oil that Russia exports into Europe is being offered for sale at a major discount because nobody wants it. JPMorgan recently estimated more than 4 million barrels per day of Russian oil has been effectively sidelined.\n\nSo investors are essentially pricing oil as if Russia’s supply isn’t available at all. And again, less supply = higher prices.\n\nWhy can’t other countries pump out more?\n\nGood old Covid strikes again. Nobody wanted oil in general in spring 2020, when global stay-at-home orders meant nobody needed to gas up and get to the office. With demand cratering, oil prices did too — even briefly trading at negative prices.\n\nIn turn OPEC+ heavily cut production to support prices. And they’ve kept production targets low since then, only gradually adding back production, even when demand for oil and gasoline bounced back sooner than expected.\n\nGuess who’s part of OPEC+? Russia. So yeah, OPEC+ isn’t rushing to the rescue. The Saudis have made crystal clear for months, even before the invasion, that the group doesn’t plan to open up the oil taps anytime soon.\n\nThat iron resolve may or may not be cracking, however. In one confusing development this week, the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to Washington told CNN that the country wants to increase oil production and will encourage its partners in OPEC+ to do so. But later the UAE’s minister of energy and infrastructure tweeted that the nation will to stick to its OPEC+ agreement and gradually raise production.\n\nAnd then, the Iraqi oil ministry said its leaders met and agreed its OPEC+ partners should balance supply and demand to stabilize the market. At this point, who knows.\n\nWhy can’t US oil companies ramp up production, then?\n\nRussia was the No. 2 oil producer in the world in 2021, pumping out 9.7 million barrels a day — but the US is No. 1 with 10.2 million. American companies don’t abide by those OPEC-style, nationally mandated production targets. But US oil producers can’t or won’t fill the supply gap, even though they could make a mint given the high prices and demand.\n\nAgain here, Covid strikes. Like many industries during the pandemic, oil producers are struggling to find staffers and source specialized equipment. Meanwhile, US oil companies are still smarting from the pain of that major oil bust in 2020, which kicked off a flurry of bankruptcies. Major oil companies’ stock performances have lagged the broader market since then too. And as makers of fossil fuels, they’re wary that future environmental policies could hurt future demand for oil.\n\nAll of the above underscores how oil and gas prices are tied to geopolitical events, the pandemic, drilling logistics and so much more. And it adds up to average US gas prices above $4.33 a gallon as of Friday.\n\nIn short, it’s all a simple case of supply and demand. But of course it’s never really so simple.", "authors": ["Julianne Pepitone"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/business/sam-bankman-fried-charges/index.html", "title": "FTX founder indicted on eight criminal charges including fraud and ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was indicted on eight criminal charges including wire fraud and conspiracy by misusing customer funds, according to an indictment from the US Attorney of the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe 30-year-old Bankman-Fried was arrested at his home in the Bahamas on Monday and appeared in court in Nassau Tuesday. He could face up to 115 years in prison if convicted on all eight counts, according to congressional statutory maximum sentencing guidelines. He did not waive his right to an extradition hearing, according to a US official. But Chief Magistrate of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas Joyann Ferguson-Pratt has denied Bankman-Fried bail.\n\nSeparately Tuesday, US markets regulators charged Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors and customers in his failed crypto exchange FTX.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said Bankman-Fried, “orchestrated a years-long fraud” to conceal from FTX investors the diversion of customer funds to Alameda Research, his crypto-trading hedge fund.\n\n“We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission also charged Bankman-Fried in a parallel action with the SEC.\n\nRegulators signaled this may be just the first of multiple charges to come. The SEC said there are ongoing investigations into “other securities law violations” and into other entities and individuals.\n\n“Mr. Bankman-Fried is reviewing the charges with his legal team and considering all of his legal options,” said Mark S. Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s lawyer, said in a statement.\n\nKnown as “SBF,” Bankman-Fried is a crypto celebrity who became a pariah overnight as his company suffered a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy last month, leaving at least a million depositors unable to access their funds.\n\nConspiracy and fraud charges\n\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York unsealed an indictment Tuesday, charging Bankman-Fried with wire fraud and multiple counts of conspiracy, including conspiracy counts to defraud investors, lenders, and the United States, commit commodities and securities fraud and money laundering, and violate campaign finance laws.\n\nProsecutors allege Bankman-Fried conspired with others on numerous schemes, including misusing customer deposits held in FTX that were used to cover the expenses of Alameda. Bankman-Fried also allegedly defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing them misleading information about the hedge fund’s financial condition.\n\nThe 14-page indictment also alleges that Bankman-Fried conspired with others to violate federal election laws by making political donations to candidates and fundraising committees between 2020 and November 2022, in excess of federal legal limits and in the names of other people.\n\nRisky bets, lavish spending\n\nFTX achieved a $32 billion valuation by raising more than $1.8 billion since launching in May 2019, including from sophisticated investors such as BlackRock, Sequoia Capital and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. Star athletes and celebrities who backed FTX also reportedly received a stake in the company, including Tom Brady and Gisele.\n\nThe SEC alleges that Bankman-Fried duped those investors who backed FTX by promoting it as a “safe, responsible” crypto trading firm that used “sophisticated, automated” risk measures to protect customer funds.\n\nIn reality, the SEC alleges, Bankman-Fried internally directed software code to be written in a way that allowed Alameda, to function with a negative balance in its the customer account at FTX.\n\nThis allegedly happened in August of 2019, just about four months after operations at FTX began.\n\nThis effectively gave Alameda a limitless line of credit funded by customer assets, according to the SEC. That meant there was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s funds that Bankman-Fried used as his “personal piggy bank,” the complaint says. He hid from investors and customers that he used the funds to buy luxury condos, support political campaigns, and make private investments, according to the SEC.\n\nBetween March 2020 and September 2022, Bankman-Fried executed loans from Alameda totaling more than $1.338 billion, including two instances in which he was both the borrower in his individual capacity and the lender in his capacity as CEO of Alameda, the SEC says in its civil complaint.\n\nBankman-Fried used funds from Alameda to purchase tens of millions of dollars in Bahamian real estate for himself, his parents, and other FTX executives, according to the filing.\n\nAlameda co-founders Nishad Singh and Gary Wang also borrowed $554 million and $224.7 million, respectively, by similarly executing promissory notes with Alameda in 2021 and 2022, the filing says.\n\nSingh and Wang have not been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe loans to Bankman-Fried and others were “poorly documented, and at times not documented at all,” the lawsuit says.\n\nWhen prices of crypto assets plummeted in May 2022, Bankman-Fried paid back Alameda’s demanding third-party lenders from its FTX “line of credit,” further growing the multi-billion-dollar liability and then concealed it in the Alameda balance sheet to avoid alarming investors, the complaint alleges.\n\nThe FTX chief executive continued to leverage the companies for his personal benefit, loaning himself $136 million in late July 2022 — one month after offering crypto financial services company BlockFi a $250 million revolving line of credit to ease its own liquidity issues, according to the filing. Meanwhile, throughout the summer, he presented a “false and misleading positive account” of the company to investors, despite its “tenuous financial condition”, the SEC alleges.\n\n“FTX operated behind a veneer of legitimacy Mr. Bankman-Fried created by, among other things, touting its best-in-class controls, including a proprietary ‘risk engine,’ and FTX’s adherence to specific investor protection principles and detailed terms of service,” Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, said in a statement. “But as we allege in our complaint, that veneer wasn’t just thin, it was fraudulent.”\n\n‘I screwed up’\n\nIn the four weeks since FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has sought to cast himself as a somewhat hapless chief executive who got out over his skis, denying accusations that he defrauded FTX’s customers.\n\n“I didn’t knowingly commit fraud,” he told the BBC over the weekend. “I didn’t want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.”\n\nBut Bankman-Fried has previously admitting making mistakes while leading FTX, which he stepped down from last month after it filed for bankruptcy.\n\n“Look, I screwed up,” Bankman-Fried said during a virtual appearance at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “There are things I would do anything to do over.”\n\nRapid descent\n\nThe speed of Bankman-Fried’s arrest caught observers, including US lawmakers, by surprise. Lawyers who aren’t involved with the case suggested the quick turnaround signals that former FTX employees may be aiding prosecutors.\n\n“Given Bankman-Fried’s apparent inability to stop talking, the smart move by former employees would be to rush to become a cooperator in exchange for more lenient treatment, and it would not be surprising to learn that one or more of them had done so,” said Howard A.

The capsule, which is fully autonomous, circled the Earth more than ten times, maneuvering closer to the ISS before making a gentle, precise contact with one of the space station’s docking ports at 7:37 pm ET.

Lindgren was born in Taiwan and spent much of his childhood in England before moving to the United States and attending the US Air Force Academy.\n\nThis group of four astronauts has spent months training together, and they even took some time to do some extracurricular bonding. Watkins noted they went on a kayaking trip in Eastern Washington “just to get to spend some time getting to know each other and understanding how we all function…and what makes each of us tick, and I think that’s going to be really crucial.”\n\n“We get along great. It is just such a joy to have these folks on this team,” Lindgren added.\n\nHow did they get to space?\n\nThe crew traveled aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which, since entering service in 2020, has now launched seven crewed missions.\n\nThough SpaceX designed the Crew Dragon to be reusable and three capsules are already in service, Crew-4 is flying aboard a brand new spacecraft, which they named “Freedom.”\n\nThe Crew Dragon was developed by SpaceX under a $2.6 billion contract with NASA as part of the “Commercial Crew Program.” The idea behind the program was to move NASA into a customer role — allowing private companies to design, build and test a new spacecraft to serve NASA astronauts while still giving the company ownership over the vehicle.\n\nSince SpaceX controls the vehicle, it has the ability to sell seats to whomever it wishes, hence the all-private mission that the company just concluded and one previous space tourism mission that took off in September last year.\n\nAt NASA, the program has been deemed a success, and the space agency is adopting the same contracting method for several vehicles involved in its efforts to explore the moon.\n\nWhat will they do in space?\n\nNow that they’ve arrived on the ISS, the crew will get caught up with the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS — including three NASA astronauts and an ESA astronaut that were part of SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission, and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThere’ll be about a five-day handover period, during which the Crew-3 astronauts will help the Crew-4 astronauts settle in, before Crew-3 returns home aboard their own SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nThen the Crew-4 astronauts will set to work on all the science experiments and space station maintenance duties they have on their to-do list.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on the aging of immune systems, organic material concrete alternatives, and cardiorespiratory effects during and after long-duration exposure to microgravity,” according to NASA. “These are just some of the more than 200 science experiments and technology demonstrations that will take place during their mission.”\n\nCrew-4 is slated to return from space in September, shortly after SpaceX launches its Crew-5 mission.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/12/spacex-polaris-dawn-mission-complete-historic-spacewalk/75173651007/", "title": "Polaris Dawn crew make historic commercial spacewalk on SpaceX ...", "text": "The pioneering spacewalk came on the third of the five-day Polaris Dawn mission, which billionaire Jared Isaacman is commanding and helping to fund along with SpaceX.\n\nThe first of three missions under the Polaris Program, the venture is intended to test technology that could one day make SpaceX founder Elon Musk's vision of crewed trips to Mars a reality.\n\nNow that the spacewalk is complete, the Polaris Dawn crew will resume other scientific tests ahead of a planned Sunday landing off the Florida coast.\n\nFor the first time ever, a crew of private spacefarers have pulled off a daring orbital maneuver that until now had been left up to only government astronauts.\n\nIn the predawn hours Thursday, the crew of the Polaris Dawn mission suited up in specially designed SpaceX gear to prepare for the vacuum of space 435 miles above Earth. When billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman and SpaceX employee Sarah Gillis exited their SpaceX Dragon capsule, they became the first commercial astronauts to do so.\n\nBecause the Dragon has no airlock, the other two members of the crew, Anna Menon and Scott “Kidd” Poteet, also were exposed to the conditions of space despite remaining in the vehicle.\n\nThe pioneering private spacewalk came on the third day of the five-day Polaris Dawn mission, which Isaacman is commanding and funding along with SpaceX. The first of three missions under the Polaris Program, the venture is intended to test technology that could one day make SpaceX founder Elon Musk's vision of crewed trips to Mars a reality.\n\nWhen the mission launched Tuesday, the SpaceX Dragon capsule bearing the astronauts traveled further into space than any spacecraft has gone in more than 50 years since NASA's Apollo era. The craft also surpassed the height reached by NASA's Gemini 11 in the 1960s, SpaceX said.\n\n“This incredible milestone is all thanks to the hard work of the crew and many SpaceX teams, all focused on a goal of making life multiplanetary,” Stu Keech, vice president of Dragon at SpaceX, said in a statement about the spacewalk.\n\nRewatch Polaris Dawn launch:Video shows SpaceX rocket launch 4-member crew for daring commercial mission\n\nTwo exit SpaceX Dragon for commercial spacewalk\n\nPreparations for the spacewalk began after the astronauts reached orbit Tuesday.\n\nShortly after liftoff, the Dragon's pressure began to slowly lower while oxygen levels inside the cabin increased, helping purge nitrogen from the crew members' bloodstreams. The protocol was to prepare the astronauts for the spacewalk and lower the risk of decompression sickness, SpaceX said.\n\nAfter the spacecraft reached a maximum altitude of about 870 miles, the Dragon was to descend to a cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth for the spacewalk itself.\n\nWhen it came time for the maneuver around 6 a.m. Thursday, Isaacman was the first to venture out of the Dragon. As he emerged from the forward hatch, the adventurer and experienced pilot soaked in the stunning view.\n\n\"Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here Earth sure looks like a perfect world,\" Isaacman said as SpaceX ground crews in Hawthorne, California could be heard on the livestream bursting into applause.\n\nGillis followed him shortly afterward, climbing out the “Skywalker” ladder at the top of the capsule to catch her first glimpse of the expanse of space. Gillis, an engineer who oversees astronaut training at SpaceX, would gain invaluable experience to train future astronauts, SpaceX officials have said.\n\nGillis was able to reenter the vehicle and securely latch and close the hatch so the crew could begin repressurizing the cabin.\n\nSpacewalk timeline\n\nHere's a look at how the Polaris Dawn spacewalk unfolded early Thursday:\n\n1:35 a.m.SpaceX announces the spacewalk was delayed from its initial start time at around 2 a.m. and will begin at 5:58 a.m. EDT. A reason for the delay was not given.\n\n5:14 a.m. Crew members climb into their spacesuits to prepare for cabin pressure to lower to that of the vacuum of space. While Isaacman and Gillis test the mobility of the spacesuits outside the capsule, Poteet and Menon remain strapped in their seats monitoring vital support systems.\n\n5:25 a.m. The crew performs communication checks.\n\n5:55 a.m. The crew is ready for seat rotation. The seats will be rotated so the crew has more room to move.\n\n6:00 a.m. The SpaceX suits come complete with a heads-up display, which displays data in the crew members' visors. It shows data such as oxygen and temperature. They have about one hour and 50 minutes to complete the spacewalk. There are now live views from the spacecraft. The crew will have helmet cams, giving people on Earth live views of what the crew is seeing.\n\n6:09 a.m. SpaceX gives the go for the spacewalk. The crew's spacesuits pressurize.\n\n6:12 a.m. The spacewalk begins.\n\n6:22 a.m. The crew finishes final pre-breath operations, a process to avoid decompression sickness.\n\n6:30 a.m. The cabin is vented, which brings Dragon to vacuum. According to SpaceX, it will take eight minutes to match the vacuum of space. For the first time in history, all four crew members will technically be on a spacewalk.\n\n6:50 a.m. Isaacman opens the hatch to venture outside.\n\n7:00 a.m. Isaacman moves back inside to make way for Gillis to exit using the Skywalker.\n\n7:04 a.m. Gillis observes that part of the seal on the hatch popped out, but it can simply be popped in, according to SpaceX.\n\n7:06 a.m. Sarah Gillis is outside testing the spacesuit. SpaceX employees erupt into cheers to see one of their own preform a spacewalk.\n\n7:14 a.m. Gillis was heard saying the seal has bulges again. She pops it back in place and prepares to close the hatch.\n\n7:16 a.m. The Dragon hatch is now closed and sealed so the spacecraft can be pressurized. The process takes about an hour, SpaceX says.\n\n7:30 a.m. Oxygen is added into the cabin. Nitrox (oxygen and nitrogen mixture) will be added to the suits to take the crew out of the suits' pure oxygen environment.\n\n7:40 a.m. The cabin continues to pressurize, and no leaks have been found. The process is slow − as in scuba diving, there must be safety stops when changing to a different pressure so the body is not overexerted.\n\n7:55 a.m. The Dragon has returned to normal pressure, what the astronauts are accustomed to on Earth. That means the crew can now get out of their EVA suits, officially ending the spacewalk.\n\nAll 4 Polaris Dawn astronauts exposed to the vacuum of space\n\nUntil now, spacewalks have come only under the purview of government spacefarers such as NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts. What's more, the maneuvers most often take place in craft with airlocks.\n\nBut because the Dragon does not have an airlock, the entire spacecraft had to be depressurized when the hatch was opened, exposing the entire crew to the vacuum of space. For that reason, even mission specialist Menon and pilot Poteet needed to wear EVA suits designed by SpaceX to receive oxygen through tethers.\n\nNot only have spacewalks historically not been commercial endeavors, but those who have taken part have done so in spacesuits regulated by a government space agency.\n\nThis time it is all being done by SpaceX. Gillis and Issacman each spent about 10 minutes outside of the Dragon moving around to test the suit's capabilities, which the rocket company developed for this flight.\n\nAside from providing a launch site at its Kennedy Space Center, NASA is not part of the Polaris Dawn mission. But after the historic spacewalk, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson took to X to congratulate SpaceX and the crew.\n\n\"Today’s success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry and NASA's long-term goal to build a vibrant U.S. space economy,\" Nelson said.\n\nWhat is the Polaris Dawn mission?\n\nPolaris Dawn is the first of three human spaceflights under the Polaris Program, all of which are intended to test SpaceX technologies needed to carry humans deep into the cosmos.\n\nIsaacman, founder of internet company Shift4 Payment, is the only member of the Polaris Dawn crew to have been to outer space before. Menon and Gillis are also now not only the the first SpaceX employees to travel to space but have traveled higher than any other women in history.\n\nThe crew has already been testing a new laser-based satellite communication system using Starlink.\n\nBefore and after the spacewalk, the crew is also conducting nearly 40 scientific experiments – many of which aim to understand the human body's reaction to long spaceflights as NASA and other space agencies set their sights on destinations like Mars.\n\nThe SpaceX Dragon will return the Polaris Dawn astronauts to Earth on Sunday, splashing down off the Florida coast.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/tech/spacex-launch-crew-4-crew-dragon-walkup-scn/index.html", "title": "SpaceX to launch another historic astronaut mission tomorrow ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spacecraft are headed back to the launch pad, kicking off the second astronaut mission for SpaceX in just one month.

A shock-and-awe campaign of overwhelming air power aimed at bombing into submission a determined opponent that, despite being vastly outgunned, had withstood everything the world’s most formidable war machine could throw at it.\n\nOperation Linebacker II saw more than 200 American B-52 bombers fly 730 sorties and drop over 20,000 tons of bombs on North Vietnam over a period of 12 days in December 1972, in a brutal assault aimed at shaking the Vietnamese “to their core,” in the words of then US national security adviser Henry Kissinger.\n\n“They’re going to be so god damned surprised,” US President Richard Nixon replied to Kissinger on December 17, the eve of the mission.\n\nIn what would become known as “the Christmas bombings” in America and “the 11 days and nights” in Vietnam (no bombing took place on Christmas day), swathes of Hanoi were obliterated.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 Vietnamese were killed amid some of the most harrowing scenes of the conflict, in an operation likened by some to the Hamburg raids of World War II for the sheer scale of the destruction and civilian death toll.\n\nThe devastating losses were not all one way. At the same time, the United States Air Force sustained losses that today would seem unfathomable. Fifteen B-52s – the pride of America’s fleet – were shot down, six in one day alone, and 33 airmen lost.\n\nTragically, some believe all these deaths were largely in vain, with historians to this day debating the extent of the operation’s influence on the wider conflict.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, both sides claimed to have come out on top – Washington claiming it brought the Vietnamese back to the table for peace talks and Hanoi painting it as a heroic act of resistance in which it took everything its foe had and still remained standing.\n\nBut if the fog of war made it hard to judge those claims, half a century on it has done little to dim the memories of the the US airmen who can still recall flying through the North Vietnamese air defenses.\n\n“It almost felt like you could walk across the tips of those missiles in the sky there were so many fired at you,” recalled one retired US airman.\n\nThe flak was so bright, he said, you could “read a newspaper in the cockpit.”\n\nA US B-52 bomber flies over Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nDeath at Christmas\n\nThe airman, interviewed by CNN to mark the 50th anniversary of the “Christmas bombings,” recalled a mood at his base that was anything but festive.\n\nTo give the the best cover possible, the bombing missions were conducted at night, with the B-52s flying out of U Tapao, Thailand, and Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Because those that made it back to base would land in darkness, the crews would not realize until breakfast the next day who among their colleagues had failed to return.\n\n“You’d see the trailer next to yours with doors open on both ends and airmen loading (the occupant’s) personal belongings into a trunk to be shipped back to their families, so you knew that crew didn’t make it,” said Wayne Wallingford, an electronic warfare officer based in U Tapao who flew on seven of the 11 raids B-52s undertook over Hanoi.\n\n“It was pretty sobering to see that.”\n\nWayne Wallingford in front of a B-52 during the Vietnam war. Courtesy Wayne Wallingford\n\nOver the 12-day period that grim ritual was performed 33 times.\n\nBut while the US Air Force’s losses were unprecedented, so too was the carnage caused by the B-52s.\n\n“The resulting physical destruction was staggering: 1,600 military installations, miles of railway lines, hundreds of trucks and railway cars, eighty percent of electrical power plants, and countless factories and other structures were taken out of commission,” wrote Vietnam War historian Pierre Asselin in his 2018 book, “Vietnam’s American War: A History.”\n\n“The Linebacker bombings crippled the North’s vital organs, obliterating the results of its communist transformation, and its ability to sustain the war in the South by extension,” Asselin wrote.\n\nSuch was the devastation that one Soviet diplomat warned that North Vietnam faced becoming “a wasteland.”\n\nA picture released on December 19, 1972, of Vietnamese people carrying victims of the American air raids on Hanoi and North Vietnam.

Dozens of craters, some 12 yards in diameter and three yards deep, pockmark the area,” Jean Leclerc du Sablon wrote in a dispatch that appeared in The New York Times on December 29, 1972.\n\nOne survivor in particular caught his eye.\n\n“On a pile of ruins, an old woman held her hands to her face and chanted hauntingly, in near religious tone: ‘Oh, my son, where are you now? May I find you to bury you. Americans, how savage you are.’”\n\nNixon’s bid for ‘peace with honor’\n\nThe driving force behind the Christmas bombings was a recently reelected President Richard Nixon, who was keen to wrap up America’s involvement in an unpopular war before the beginning of his second term in January.\n\nNixon had been reelected just over a month earlier on a promise to attain “peace with honor” in Vietnam – where the US had been fighting since 1965 – and was stung when talks with North Vietnam suddenly fell through.\n\nHe warned Hanoi it would face consequences if it did not return to the negotiating table in good faith and ordered Linebacker II even as a new set of demands were being sent to the North Vietnamese.\n\nThe Air Force’s reaction was swift; on December 18, 129 B-52s took off from Guam and Thailand, destination North Vietnam.\n\nWhat was that awaiting the world’s most formidable bombers were the world’s most formidable air defenses.\n\nA B-52 bomber takes off from Andersen Air Force Base in support of Linebacker II. US Air Force\n\n‘America’s fortress’\n\nAt the time, the B-52 bomber was the gold standard of aerial firepower.\n\nThe eight-engine Stratofortress, some of which could carry more than 80,000 pounds of ordnance, first flew in 1954 and was designed to be an intercontinental bomber that could deliver nuclear payloads anywhere in the world.\n\nAlongside intercontinental ballistic missiles and ballistic missile submarines, it formed one prong of the nuclear triad America hoped would deter any possible atomic war with the Soviet Union.\n\nBut in the 1960s it began to take on more conventional bombing missions as the US enlisted its help in its struggle against Soviet-supported communist expansion in Indochina.\n\nThe B-52s were able to fly higher than the naked eye could see, making its attacks both physically and psychologically devastating as its massive payloads would arrive seemingly from nowhere.\n\n“(Nixon) wanted maximum psychological impact on the North Vietnamese, and the B-52 was airpower’s best tool for the job,” historian T.W. Beagle wrote in a 2001 report for the US Air Force’s Air University Press.\n\nStill, as formidable as the B-52s were, the tactics they employed hadn’t changed much since World War II.\n\nAnd for some of their crews, that would prove fatal.\n\nA picture released on December 19, 1972, of American B-52 air raids on Hanoi and North Vietnam shows a North Vietnamese antiaircraft missile. AFP/Getty Images\n\nFly into the danger zone\n\nNorth Vietnam’s air defenses were backed by Soviet-made SA-2 antiaircraft missiles, capable of shooting a 288-pound warhead to altitudes of 60,000 feet at more than three times the speed of sound.\n\nUS aircrew said they looked like telephone poles with lights and would illuminate the entire night sky.\n\nOn the first night of Linebacker II, North Vietnam fired 200 of them at the attacking US bombers and at least five of those missiles found their targets.\n\nThree B-52 were brought down, and two others were damaged.\n\nAs if that were not daunting enough, the crews back at U Tapao were left in no doubt that more casualties were expected.\n\nEtched into Wallingford’s memory are the words of a general that day.\n\n“He said, ‘Well, we thought we were going to lose a lot more of you than we did,’” Wallingford said. “That wasn’t a very motivational speech.”\n\nWayne Wallingford, then and now.\n\nAn open US playbook\n\nThe disastrous first day of the B-52s might have hit morale in U Tapao and Guam, but it had the opposite effect in Hanoi.\n\n“We all feared the B-52 at first because the US said it was invincible,” Nguyen Van Phiet, a North Vietnamese missile gunner credited with downing four B-52s during Linebacker, told Smithsonian magazine in 2014. “But after the first night, we knew the B-52 could be destroyed just like any other aircraft.”\n\nOn the second night, the B-52s fared better with only two damaged out of 93 flying and none lost.\n\nBut by night three, the North Vietnamese gunners had seen the US playbook and knew it as well as their US opponents.\n\nThe bombers would fly in long columns over predetermined tracks and after releasing their payloads would make banked turns to head home – at which point their electronic jamming equipment (meant to thwart antiaircraft batteries) would be facing skyward, leaving them vulnerable.\n\n“We were told for the last two minutes of the bomb run to stay straight and level which means you are a sitting target,” Wallingford said.\n\nOpening the doors to the bomber’s cavernous bomb bay increased its radar signature even further, he said. “It’s kind of a losing proposition.”\n\nTaken together, this meant the raids were “so predictable that any enemy would be able to knock you down kind of like the arcade at the carnival,” Ron Bartlett, another B-52 electronic warfare officer, told a Distinguished Flying Cross Society podcast.\n\nOn night three, six B-52s crashed to the ground.\n\nA picture released on December 19, 1972, of a North Vietnamese antiaircraft gun. AFP/Getty Images\n\nThose losses did not go down well with the American public or Nixon, who “raised holy hell” about the bombers taking the same routes every night and who feared the heavy loss of America’s mightiest warplanes would “create the antithesis of the psychological impact (he) desired,” according to Beagle.\n\nFrom the following night, the bombers were told to approach their targets from varied altitudes and directions; and not to fly single file or over targets they’d just hit.\n\nOver the final seven days of bombing, only six more B-52s were shot down.\n\nWas it all in vain?\n\nAt some point after day eight of the bombings, North Vietnam informed the US it was ready to resume peace talks in Paris.\n\nThis justified the operation, Nixon claimed. But many experts have since suggested this would have happened anyway and that a more patient Nixon could have avoided the horror and bloodshed on both sides.\n\nThey say that by late 1972 Hanoi’s war effort was already on shaky ground. Resources were low, and it would not have been able to sustain its war effort much longer.\n\n“By the time of Linebacker II, the North Vietnamese were prepared to meet the demands outlined in Paris to get the United States out of the war,” wrote Brian Laslie, command historian at the US Air Force Academy, in his 2021 book “Air Power’s Lost Cause.”\n\nAsselin, meanwhile, believes the North Vietnamese Politburo agreed on December 18, just hours before the bombing began, to let Washington know they would return to the peace talks.\n\n“Unfortunately, before it could relay its decision to the White House, it was already too late; Nixon had reached the end of his tether. At 8 p.m., Hanoi time, that same day, the United States commenced its most savage bombing of the North to date,” Asselin wrote.\n\nWinners and winners (and losers)\n\nWhat is not in dispute is that the Paris Peace Talks resumed on January 8, 1973, and an accord was signed on January 27 that ushered in the beginning of the end to US involvement in the war.\n\nIt was signed not only by the US and North Vietnam, but also by the South Vietnamese who had been convinced by Linebacker that, “if North Vietnam attacked again the US would return to bombing Hanoi,” said Peter Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and a former Royal Australian Air Force officer.\n\nWith the accord behind them, both Washington and Hanoi then claimed themselves the victors of Operation Linebacker II.\n\nAirman Wallingford and others are emphatic about a US victory.\n\n“It was the operation that ended the Vietnam conflict and that freed our 591 POWs,” he said. (Those American prisoners of war were released in February and March after the accords were signed.)\n\nBut even in America, some had their doubts.\n\nRobert Hopkins, a former US Air Force pilot, cautioned against falling into the “Linebacker II was a success trap,” saying that for the B-52 pilots it “deeply hurt morale for years to come.”\n\nThere was a more immediate problem, too.\n\nThree years on, with the Communist forces largely replenished and US forces largely out of Vietnam, Hanoi launched the large scale invasion of the South that led to the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975.\n\n“Linebacker II ended the American phase of the war, but its impact only lasted three years. Linebacker II did not bring lasting peace,” Layton said.\n\nIn Hanoi, “the story of the events of late December 1972 was a tale, not of massive loss and destruction, but of heroic resistance by Northerners,” wrote the historian Asselin.\n\n“In fact, the toll on the US forces had been such that it had forced Nixon to beg Hanoi to resume the peace talks, and to unilaterally and unconditionally end the bombing,” he wrote.\n\nOr as Kissinger, the US national security adviser of the time, was reported to have said:\n\n“We bombed the North Vietnamese into accepting our concessions.”", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2020/05/22/elon-musk-beats-out-boeing-space-race-launch-nasa-astronauts/3054947001/", "title": "Elon Musk beats out Boeing in the space race to launch NASA ...", "text": "To understand how a former software engineer with no space experience built a company selected to launch NASA astronauts to orbit, it might help to go back to a brisk February evening in 2008, when a guy you probably never heard of rode shotgun next to Elon Musk, holding on for dear life as Musk raced the first ever production Tesla through the streets of Los Angeles.\n\n\"This thing just slams you to the back of your seat like a fighter jet does,” Silicon Valley tech blogger, Robert Scoble wrote on his blog the next day.\n\nScoble was simply in the right place at the right time. He was having dinner with his buddy Jason Calacanis, an early investor in Tesla, when Musk called and challenged Calacanis to a race: his new Corvette against Musk’s midnight black Roadster P1.\n\nAt the time, the idea that an electric car could beat General Motors’ high-performance sports car engineered with 50 years of racing expertise and powered by a 420 horse power V.8 engine was laughable.\n\nThe Tesla smoked the Vette.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n“The Tesla pulled away so fast from the Corvette we couldn’t even see the Corvette in our rear view mirror,” Scoble said.\n\nThat night Musk did more than win a street race. He proved that one man with a vision and a new way of doing things could potentially derail the 100-year-old automotive industry.\n\n“That’s the Silicon Valley approach; you start out with a clean slate. It’s called First Principles thinking. Let’s question everything. They’re not thinking about what came before. They really don’t care. They’re looking at the problem fresh and using any tool they can to give them an edge,” Scoble told FLORIDA TODAY.\n\nElon was already applying these principles in the space industry with his six-year-old start-up SpaceX, which successfully launched its first Falcon 1 rocket into orbit around the Earth that same year.\n\nTwelve years later, on May 27, SpaceX is slated to be the first private company ever to launch astronauts to the International Space Station aboard the Dragon crew capsule. To cross the finish line first, Musk slashed production costs, built a reusable rocket and spacecraft from the ground up and beat out a 100-year-old aviation giant in the process. Sound familiar?\n\nStart your engines\n\nThe Commercial Crew space race began in Sept. 2014 when NASA selected two private companies, SpaceX and Boeing, to build human rated spacecraft in order to return American astronauts to space after the retiring of the Shuttle in 2011. The U.S has relied on the Russian Soyuz rocket to give astronauts a lift since then.\n\nAt its core, the goal of the Commercial Crew program is for NASA to move away from owning, operating and maintaining spacecraft and instead to buy seats on capsules built by private companies.\n\nTo do something that has never been done, NASA hedged its bets by choosing two companies that couldn’t be any more different from each other.\n\n“They knew that if they had an experienced, traditional space company they would have a fair amount of reliability but there was a lot of fascination with SpaceX, and the fact that SpaceX was already flying a vehicle , which could fairly easily — it seemed — serve as a basis for a crew vehicle, made that a really compelling proposition,” Andy Aldrin, Director of the Aldrin Space Institute at Florida Tech, explained.\n\n“SpaceX, what they do better than probably anybody is quick iteration at the early stages, quick prototyping, testing failure, redesign. Call it the Silicon Valley world as opposed to the supply chain defense contractor world,” said Dylan Taylor, investor and CEO of Voyager Space Holdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing came to the table with decades of experience in aviation and space.\n\n“Boeing is probably the best manufacturer in the world, look at how many aircraft they’ve made, how many pieces of defense hardware,” Taylor continued.\n\nBoeing’s entrant into the race was its Starliner crew capsule which draws heavily on the company’s history of work on the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.\n\nFor SpaceX to be going head to head against Boeing was an astounding accomplishment. Lawrence Williams was a founding executive at SpaceX and remembers how difficult it was for SpaceX to get a seat at the table when they started.\n\n“It wasn’t just that we were up against incumbents like Boeing and Lockheed but we were up against the entire space military industrial complex. We had trouble getting meetings with NASA for years. We were not welcome.”\n\nWilliams choked back tears as he recalled how personal it was for Musk and everyone at the company at the time.\n\n“In those early days we were just fighting for our lives, fighting for credibility. We were launching this pipsqueak little rocket Falcon one. Nobody wanted to pay attention to us. Lockheed would call us literally an “ankle biter” like a gnat because that’s how inconsequential we were.”\n\nAs a start-up, SpaceX had the advantage of operating lean in every department. Moving fast and keeping costs low was baked into the DNA of SpaceX from the beginning. Engineers used 3D printed parts for prototypes. If the parts didn’t work, they re-designed them – quickly.\n\nThe SpaceX approach reminded many Apollo-era astronauts and engineers of the early days at NASA when it was in a race to get Americans to the Moon before the Russians.\n\n“We are much more risk averse today than we were 50 years ago, and I think a little bit of that was good. Elon Musk in particular, I think, tends to cut a little corner here and there to get something done and launch what he wants to launch,” the late Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden said at a Florida Tech event. “The greater the reward, the greater the risk.”\n\nThe greater the risk, the greater the cool factor as well. Scoble argues a traditional company known for a more conservative approach like Boeing just isn’t sexy enough to attract the kind of talent needed to revolutionize space.\n\n“If you’re a brilliant person graduating from Carnegie Mellon or Stanford, are you gonna work for Boeing where you get a nice salary but no real chance to see a stock option package that could change your family’s life? Or are you gonna go work for some crazy dude Elon Musk who says, ‘ Hey, we might totally fail, but we’re gonna give you stock options and we have big dreams of totally changing everything.’\"\n\nThat, in part experts say, is why Silicon Valley has done so well against big companies. \"The talent tends to go to the riskier mission driven companies that have a singular focus,” Scoble said.\n\nThe allure of working for a maverick playboy billionaire helps too.\n\nWhen he’s not doing cameos in Hollywood movies, he’s dating actresses and pop stars. And no amount of bad-boy behavior seems to dull his luster, including all-night Twitter rants or smoking pot on Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\n“I guarantee by doing that he got a lot of resumes. They’re like ‘I wanna work for that dude, he’s cool,’” Scoble said.\n\nBurnouts\n\nIn May 2015, SpaceX completed a successful \"pad abort test\" which simulated how Dragon would whisk astronauts to safety if an emergency happened during launch.\n\nBut it took nearly four years until SpaceX completed the next major flight test, known as Demo-1. In between, the company was busy with its core business of cargo resupply missions to the ISS and Crew Dragon development that included mock landings and parachute testing.\n\nThen in Sept. 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launch pad, delaying the company’s ability to get the rocket rated for human spaceflight. It took them more than a year to re-design the system.\n\n\"This is the toughest puzzle that we've ever had to solve,\" Musk told CNBC at the time.\n\nThe incident also brought up serious concerns about SpaceX's “load and go” fueling process, which will have astronauts strapped into a Dragon capsule while the Falcon rocket below them is fueled with kerosene and super-cold liquid oxygen.\n\n“SpaceX came into it as a clear favorite. They already had the vehicle, so in theory they were just going to need to put in the systems that were needed,” Aldrin said. “But as it turns out that’s a lot more challenging than just putting in life-support systems. Getting a vehicle ready to fly NASA astronauts involves a lot of work.”\n\nOn March 2, 2019, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center carrying a test dummy named Ripley headed for the space station, making it the first commercially built and operated American crew spacecraft and rocket to launch from U.S. soil on a mission to the ISS.\n\nThe roar of celebration at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne was almost as deafening as the capsule’s powerful Merlin engines. A couple days later Dragon successfully docked autonomously with the ISS — the first of any U.S. spacecraft to do so — and six days later returned to Earth splashing down in the Atlantic ocean.\n\n“This is a significant achievement in the history of American spaceflight,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said after the launch.\n\nOnly a month later when SpaceX was in the home stretch of launching humans, the same capsule blew up during an abort system test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It was a devastating setback.\n\nWhen watching the dramatic explosion it was hard to imagine how SpaceX would rebound yet again.\n\nAnousheh Ansari was the first female space tourist and has been a supporter of Musk through the years. She said frequent re-iterations are key to SpaceX’s success.\n\n“There is a lot of emphasis on fails. Fail fast, fail in small steps so you don’t have a big disaster at the end. So there’s a lot of teams working together on every little piece of the project pushing boundaries.”\n\nWhile NASA and SpaceX investigated the incident, Musk made modifications to the design of the Dragon capsule while also upgrading its parachute system. The changes appear to have worked.\n\nScoble points out this is another quality that helped SpaceX leap ahead.\n\n“In a highly chaotic industry that is rapidly changing it’s good to have a dictator in charge who can make decisions really quickly,” Scoble said.\n\nThere can be a downside of such a personality at the helm as well. Reports from former SpaceX employees have described a man that has little patience for dissent which has created an atmosphere of fear among the ranks.\n\n“He would overrule engineers that had way more experience than him,\" Williams recalled, “but that was one of his points of genius was to come in and ask every question – why is it done that way? Why couldn’t it be this way? And a lot of time in aerospace it’s because it’s always been done that way. The fact of the matter is that’s how you keep doing things the same way and things don’t evolve.”\n\nBut his cavalier approach, taken with his penchant to speak his mind, has also gotten him in trouble at times with NASA .\n\nTraditionalists at NASA often favor team players who only vent softly inside the system. Elon is well known to take his grievances to the press, to social media and, when it matters, to members of congress.\n\n“The weaknesses might be that he’s very outspoken. He can’t control it. He says what he thinks and that doesn’t always help things,” Williams said.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing’s Starliner also had several big stumbling blocks along the way at the same time the company's core aviation business was rocked by tragedy and scandal.\n\nStarliner has completed a successful launch abort test of its capsule but only two of its three parachutes deployed. A few months the capsule missed docking with the space station because of multiple software issues. In addition to these setbacks, Boeing had to deal with fallout from their 737 Max crashes that resulted in hundreds of deaths and the grounding of fleets of their planes.\n\n\"They had this disaster with the 737. Are those executives really focused on the space division right now? No, they're focused on saving the company,\" Scoble said.\n\nThe Finish Line\n\nIn January, SpaceX completed the Dragon’s in-flight abort test – the last major milestone to prove it was ready to fly astronauts. A couple months later, when Boeing and NASA announced that Boeing would re-do the orbital test flight before Starliner could fly astronauts, SpaceX’s place in history was sealed.\n\nMusk’s long term vision has always been to make humans a multi-planetary species. This first human launch is just one leg of the marathon to get to Mars.\n\n“He is the most tenacious individual I have ever worked with, and willing to risk it all over and over again because he just believes,\" Williams said.\n\nIn only a couple of days, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will suit up for the historic launch aboard a brand new spacecraft. The last time American astronauts did that was the first Space Shuttle in 1981.They’ll be wearing sleek white and gray SpaceX designed spacesuits and riding to the launch pad in a gleaming new Tesla Model X.\n\nContact Rachael Joy at 321-242-3577 and follow her on Twitter @Rachael_Joy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2019/08/23/star-wars-land-disney-millennium-falcon/2080503001/", "title": "Star Wars Land in Orlando: What its like to pilot Millennium Falcon", "text": "Before I stepped into that fabled cockpit, the only Falcon I'd ever piloted through the universe was a used yellow Ford — my car while I was in college.\n\nAs \"Star Wars\" was being filmed for its eventual May 25, 1977, release, I was a communications major at a Kentucky college, Jimmy Carter was president and Harrison Ford (now 77) was younger than my youngest nephew is now. It's hard to remember a world when the Force wasn't with us, and when I wasn't enamored by the motivational messages (especially from Yoda) that the franchise unleashed into the pop culture lexicon.\n\nBut on Aug. 19, 2019, with my trusty co-pilot, aka my husband Doug at my side, I piloted the Millennium Falcon.\n\nYes. Forty-two years after the release of the first of 1,283 films in the \"Star Wars\" franchise (OK, really just 12), I was in charge of left-to-right movement in Han Solo's baby.\n\nAnd it all happened on Batuu at Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, via the Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run flight simulator ride.\n\nExcited, we are:Star Wars Land lands at Disney's Hollywood Studios in Orlando\n\nFans and the Force:These Star Wars super fans named their kids after the characters\n\nLet's get real here. I did crash the craft at least once (OK, maybe twice) but at least I didn't have to bypass the starter with a screwdriver, as I did with the far-less-responsive 1969 Falcon.\n\nI'm not one to ruin things in advance for \"Star Wars\" fans salivating at the prospect of this ride. I've been accused of being that \"spoiler\" person who can't wait to spill details on, well, everything.\n\nJust a few, though ...\n\nSo once you're at Galaxy's Edge, visiting Batuu and its port, Black Spire Outpost, you're going to queue up in a cavernous area headed inside the Falcon, which is tucked into a docking bay awaiting its next crew.\n\nAs you wind your way through Ohnaka Transport Solutions, you'll first hear from the dreadlocked Hondo Ohnaka, an audio-animatronic space pirate who needs crew members for smuggling runs. He's a hoot, as is watching his droid. The way the story goes, Chewbacca has landed the YT-1300 light freighter, which I swear I didn't screw up, at the port. The Wookiee has made a deal with Ohnaka to finance the repairs. And Ohnaka can supply the crews. I'm wondering what Chewie got into that left him broke, but that's another flight of fantasy.\n\nThere's lots to look at as you progress through the queue toward the Holy Grail of the Cockpit, from authentically beat-up tools and stormtrooper armor to a wildly detailed, animated starship engine to killer views of the top of the Falcon and the outpost. Plus there's \"hologram chess\" in the holding area, the kind in \"Star Wars: A New Hope.\"\n\nAnd then on to the cockpit ...\n\nEach run in the Millennium Falcon requires two pilots, two engineers and two gunners to pull it off, with dozens of flashing buttons and switches, jaw-dropping effects and, at the end, accuracy reports.\n\nThe gunners on my flight as a pilot were Shawn and Jennifer Eisenman from Port Orange, Florida, longtime Star Wars fans. Shawn directed my husband and me, twice, not to crash.\n\nAnd we were off. Thrust, I tell you, into hyperspace.\n\nIt's immersive. It's fast-moving and you'll be tempted to look around to take it all in. As Qui-Gon Jinn tells Obi-Wan Kenobi in \"Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace,\" \"Feel, don't think, use your instincts.\"\n\nTrivia:Test your Star Wars knowledge, young Padawans\n\nMmm, Blue Milk:Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge has lots of fun food, drinks\n\nI admit: I shouted. I cheered. More than once. Maybe five times. As a lefty pilot in the left-hand seat, I had only to remember left from right with my control, as my husband took care of the \"up is down, down is up\" part to my right and we (sometimes) avoided asteroids and assorted vehicles coming at me faster than I imagined possible.\n\nThe Eisenmans shouted and cheered, too.\n\n\"Entering the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon was mind-blowing to me because it's almost a complete duplicate of the original,\" Shawn said.\n\n\"The interaction between piloting, gunners and engineers to control your fate on the ride was exciting ... Overall, I think it was awesome.\"\n\nI agree: It's, as my husband said, like Star Tours meets Mission Space, with the wonderful effects of Flight of Passage, but you can throw away the 3D glasses and just enjoy. Gotta say: After a second flight, I prefer the pilot's spot. It's truly the most critical to the mission, IMHO. But even though if you're a gunner or engineer, you could just sit there and let the ride take over: You won't want to. As a gunner, I fired away at incoming danger for all I was worth (a woeful 30 percent accuracy rate, but my piloting was, I swear, stellar). And engineers fix the damage to the ship. In those roles, Doug and I had more of a chance to take in everything inside the cockpit — and simply enjoy.\n\nAs Yoda would tell you: Do, or do not. There is no try.\n\nAnd for almost five glorious minutes, kick back and be like that adrenaline-charged kid I remember — who, through no fault of her own, destroyed the drive shaft on a far less exciting Falcon.\n\nContact Kennerly at 321-242-3692\n\nor bkennerly@floridatoday.com.\n\nTwitter: @bybrittkennerly\n\nFacebook: /bybrittkennerly\n\nSupport local journalism: Subscribe to FLORIDA TODAY at floridatoday.com/subscribe.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/weather/buffalo-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm in Buffalo: Crews work to clear snow-covered roads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe winter storm death toll has risen to 37 in Erie County, New York, as crews continue to clear roads and first responders check on people they couldn’t reach days ago when the catastrophic weather system swept the nation, officials there said Wednesday.\n\nAt least 25 others across 11 US states also have been reported dead in the storm, which buried the city of Buffalo in nearly 52 inches of snow, trapping residents in western New York at home – many without heat as the Christmas weekend blizzard took out power lines.\n\n“It’s a horrible storm with too many deaths,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said at a news conference as he praised first responders, without whom “more people would have died.”\n\nNow, authorities are going door-to-door to conduct wellness checks, Poloncarz said: An EMS task force is checking locations of emergency calls that authorities could not reach during the storm, while the National Guard will spend the next couple days checking every house in neighborhoods that lost power.\n\n“We are fearful that there are individuals who may have perished living alone or people who were not doing well in an establishment, especially those that still don’t have power,” Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo police completed sifting through 911 calls going back to the early days of the storm, Commissioner Joseph A. Gramaglia said Wednesday. He told CNN’s Pamela Brown that it was a “tremendous” effort that also resulted in the recovery of a “substantial” number of bodies. The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars. We have people that were walking during blizzard conditions and passed away on the street, passed away in snowbanks,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said. “And we have people that were found that passed away in their homes.”\n\nNational Guard members check on Buffalo residents on Wednesday, December 28, 2022.

In one of those cases, emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow, he told CNN a day earlier.\n\n“They were blocked, and by the time they got there it was too late,” Poloncarz said.\n\nOne Buffalo EMT told CNN she was stuck in her ambulance for hours Friday after trying to respond to an emergency call during the snowstorm.\n\n“The main reason we were getting stuck is because there were cars in the way,” said Joycelyn Benton, an advanced EMT at American Medical Response of Western New York.

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nBenton said she thinks officials could have put out snow plows earlier, sent National Guard resources in earlier and instituted the travel ban earlier to keep cars off the street.\n\n“Not being able to help people is horrible,” she told CNN. “Knowing we could be a block away from a call but we couldn’t get to it because of the weather was difficult.”\n\nThis storm marked the first time the Buffalo Fire Department could not respond to emergency calls because of severe conditions, Poloncarz said, citing the agency’s historian. Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/us/larry-nassar-fbi-mishandling-claim/index.html", "title": "Larry Nassar abuse case: Olympic gymnasts Biles, Raisman and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAttorneys for more than 90 women and girls who were sexually abused by disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar submitted claims for over $1 billion to the FBI, saying investigators could have ended Nassar’s predation and protected other victims had they not mishandled the case.\n\nThe claimants include Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney and world championship medalist Maggie Nichols. Each has asked for $50 million, according to the law firm that represents them.\n\nGymnasts Kaylee Lorincz and Hannah Morrow are each asking for $42.5 million, the attorneys said. Lawyers say most of the 90 women are asking for $10 million each; in total, the sum would be in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range.\n\nCNN contacted the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI, and officials there declined to comment.\n\nUnder the Federal Tort Claims Act, claimants are required to give notice to the federal agency before a lawsuit is filed in federal court. The agency then has six months to either reach a settlement or deny the claim before the lawsuit can be brought.\n\nIn the notice of the Federal Tort Act claims, attorneys say the FBI had credible complaints from numerous victims by July 2015 – but neglected to interview them or properly investigate the abuse.\n\nThe claims say in part that “the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) possessed credible complaints from numerous sources and corroborating evidence of Dr Larry Nassar’s (Nassar) sexual assaults of young women and children over the course of a number of years and across the globe.”\n\n“FBI officials, who possessed this knowledge and were in a position to end Nassar’s predation, were grossly derelict in their duties resulting in Nassar sexually assaulting approximately 100 young women and children between July 28, 2015 and September 12, 2016, and conspired with the highest-ranking officials within the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and USA Gymnastics, Inc to conceal this known sexual abuse from foreseeable victims,” the claims state.\n\n“The FBI was grossly derelict in their duties by declining to interview gymnasts who were willing to talk about the abuse, failing to transfer the complaint to Lansing Michigan where Nassar was continuing to abuse girls, ignoring its obligation to report child abuse to relevant state and federal agencies and lying to Congress, the media and FBI headquarters about their lack of diligence in investigating the Nassar complaint,” attorneys for the victims said in a statement.\n\n“As a result, Nassar continued his predatory behavior, sexually assaulting approximately 90 young women and children between July 28, 2015, and September 12, 2016.”\n\nNichols, an NCAA national champion, demanded accountability from the FBI.\n\n“The FBI knew that Larry Nassar was a danger to children when his abuse of me was first reported in September of 2015. For 421 days they worked with USA Gymnastics and USOPC to hide this information from the public and allowed Nassar to continue molesting young women and girls,” Nichols said. “It is time for the FBI to be held accountable.”\n\nNassar, the longtime doctor for the USA Gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison on child pornography charges.\n\nHe also was sentenced to a 40-to-175 year state prison sentence in Michigan after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report found gross failures by the FBI to properly investigate complaints from gymnasts, who told the bureau in 2015 about the abuse.\n\nThe inspector general found the agents lied to investigators, but the Justice Department during the Trump administration and again early in the Biden administration declined to bring charges.\n\nIn April, 13 of Nassar’s sexual assault victims submitted separate claims against the FBI totaling $130 million, saying all the agents involved in the Nassar investigation elected to “turn a blind eye” to the sexual abuse perpetrated on children by Nassar.\n\nThose 13 victims accused agents of “negligence” and “wrongful acts” during the investigation, according to administrative tort claims seeking $10 million for each victim.\n\nIn May, the Justice Department announced it wouldn’t bring charges against two former FBI agents accused of mishandling the sex abuse inquiry Nassar – the third time prosecutors reached that conclusion.\n\nIn a statement at the time, the department said that the latest decision to decline prosecution of the agents came “after multiple reviews and analyses of evidence gathered in the investigation of the former agents, and reflects the recommendation of experienced prosecutors.”", "authors": ["Jean Casarez Evan Perez Rob Frehse Kristina Sgueglia", "Jean Casarez", "Evan Perez", "Rob Frehse", "Kristina Sgueglia"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/outdoors/2017/03/15/outdoor-knoxville-event-calendar-march-17-26/99176044/", "title": "Outdoor Knoxville Event Calendar, March 17-26", "text": "Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nFRIDAY\n\nHIKE SEVEN ISLANDS STATE BIRDING PARK\n\nRCS Hiking Club\n\n9:40 am at Seven Islands State Birding Park or 9:00 am at Patriot Park, Pigeon Forge\n\nWe'll explore Seven Islands State Birding Park in Kodak this week.

But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18.

Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn. She is not going back there just now, because the white people are anxious to hang her up by the neck in the market place, and burn the soles of her feet, and gouge her beautiful dark eyes out with red-hot irons.'' — The London Sun, 1894.\n\n29.

Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32.

In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing.

Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair. Acquitted of the charges, LaRue returns to Memphis frequently in the 1970s and '80s as a guest of the nostalgia-oriented Memphis Film Festival.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins. During its late-1960s heyday, the Merrymobile company operates dozens of the iconic vehicles, which — with their striped canopy roofs — resemble circus tents or fairground carousels on wheels.\n\n90.

Opening night movies include \"The Glass Bottom Boat,\" with Doris Day, and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\n97. 1967: Inspired by Oakland's Black Panthers, young Memphis militants organize a \"black power\" group called the Invaders.

About a dozen Memphis and Shelby County library titles — including \"Valley of the Dolls,\" \"Myra Breckenridge\" and \"Portnoy's Complaint\" — are placed off limits to readers under 18 in the summer of 1969 after Mayor Henry Loeb attended a library board meeting and \"shooed all women out of the room and read aloud passages he had underlined in red ink\" from \"Portnoy,\" according to The Commercial Appeal.

College officials quickly comply, and the boy is released unharmed two hours later.\n\n115. March 1971: In a victory for the citizens who organized to fight plans to extend Interstate 40 through Overton Park, the U.S. Supreme Court overturns decisions by district and appellate courts and rules that the federal Secretary of Transportation had failed to demonstrate the lack of “feasible and prudent” alternatives to the park route, as required by a 1966 highway bill intended to protect public spaces. The decision preserves the park.\n\n116. June 7, 1971: After years in Ellis Auditorium, professional wrestling relocates to the Mid-South Coliseum, attracting 9,253 fans for opening-night matches showcasing such suplex superstars as Tojo Yamamoto, Bearcat Brown, the Fabulous Moolah, Len Rossi and Sputnik Monroe.

April 20, 1972: U.S. District Judge Robert McRae Jr. orders the Memphis Board of Education to implement a desegregation plan that will require the busing of an estimated 13,789 students during the following school year.

East Memphis' 34-story Clark Tower is completed in June 1972, adjacent to the 22-story White Station Tower (now the i-Bank Tower), which opened seven years earlier. The twin towers remain East Memphis anomalies.\n\n119. April 17, 1973: Fred Smith's Federal Express — now, FedEx — begins operations when 14 aircraft take off from Memphis to deliver 186 packages to 25 U.S cities, absolutely positively overnight.\n\n120. June 4, 1973: The Park Commission ends the popular practice of staging commercial rock concerts in the Overton Park Shell after complaints about \"criminal\" behavior in the audience. According to the Memphis Press-Scimitar, crowds \"at various times smoked marijuana, drank alcoholic beverages, took drugs and openly participated in love-making.\"\n\n121. 1974: Harold Ford Sr. becomes the first black person elected to Congress in Tennessee. Other Fords who have held elective office include his brothers, John, Joe, Edmund and James; his sister, Ophelia; his uncle, Emmitt; and his son, Harold Jr., to name a few.\n\n122. The city completes construction of the Mid-America Mall on Main Street in 1975.

In what comes to be regarded as a revolutionary moment in the history of photography, an exhibit of color work by William Eggleston goes on display on May 24, 1976, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, establishing the Memphis photographer as arguably the Bluff City's most influential artist outside the realm of music.\n\n125. Nov. 23, 1976: A pistol-toting and inebriated Jerry Lee Lewis is arrested after pulling up to the gates of Graceland in a new Lincoln Continental and demanding to see Elvis.

Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club. (The shot made up for a past tournament, when one of Ford's errant balls beaned a spectator.)\n\n130. Aug. 16, 1977: Elvis Presley dies at 42.\n\n131. A trio of apparent would-be grave robbers said to be plotting to burgle Elvis' body from Forest Hill Cemetery are arrested on Aug. 29, 1977, when one of them turns FBI informant.

Nov. 15, 1977: Memphis-based \"Woolly Bully\" creator Sam the Sham releases \"The Wookie,\" a \"Star Wars\"-inspired would-be dance hit that celebrates Han Solo's furry sidekick, Chewbacca. Sample lyric: \"Not too many things can bend him out of shape/ His mama must have come from the Planet of the Apes.\"\n\n133. Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. A charismatic and telegenic preacher, Rogers is a leader in the denomination's \"conservative resurgence,\" which emphasizes a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.\n\n135. Known for pastel-colored playful postmodern furniture and ceramics, an internationally influential affiliation of Italian designers in 1980 dubs itself \"The Memphis Group,\" in homage to the Bob Dylan song, \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.\"\n\n136. July 13, 1980: Memphis experiences what remains its record high temperature: 108 degrees.\n\n137. After Mayor Wyeth Chandler resigns from office in 1982 to accept a Circuit Court judgeship, City Council member J.O. Patterson Jr. is named interim mayor — making him the city's first black mayor. (W.W. Herenton does not become the first elected black mayor until 10 years later.)\n\n138. Graceland opens to the public on July 7, 1982 — less than five years after Elvis' death. It is now the second most-visited home in the U.S., after the White House.\n\n139.

The 34-hour siege ends when police storm the office and kill Goulet on Feb. 5, 1982.\n\n140.

April 5, 1982: Wrestler Jerry Lawler \"injures\" comedian/wrestler Andy Kaufman with a \"piledriver\" move at the Mid-South Coliseum, a highlight of a still much talked-about feud that reaches its apex in July when Lawler slaps Kaufman's face on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\"\n\n142. January 1983: The \"Shannon Street\" tragedy leaves seven suspects dead after police storm a North Memphis house and kill all occupants, following the torture death of a police officer, Robert S. Hester, 34, who had been held hostage in the house.\n\n143. The city's daily evening newspaper, the distinctively named Memphis Press-Scimitar, publishes its final edition on Halloween 1983.

Memphis State University football coach Rex Dockery, 41, and three others — freshman defensive back Charles Greenhill, offensive coordinator Chris Faros and booster Glenn Jones — are killed Dec. 12, 1983, in a small plane crash while en route to a speaking engagement in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.\n\n145. Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appears onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly dancers at \"adult\" nightclubs — remove their tops. The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club. Newspaper stories promise that the coinage \"will soon grace billboards, newspaper advertisements and possibly airwaves.\" Memphis boosters are asked to use the phrase as often as possible. It is never heard of again.\n\n149. Oct. 30, 1983: Founded in 1901, Bellevue Baptist Church votes to leave its longtime Midtown location and relocate to a Cordova campus, where it expands to \"megachurch\" proportions.\n\n150. \"While most of us were stuffing ourselves with turkey,\" The Commercial Appeal reports on Nov. 25, 1983, \"a pair of armed, Halloween-masked gunmen pulled off the largest robbery in Memphis history, stealing an estimated $2 million from the Wells Fargo building on Monroe.\"\n\n151. Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Ben Affleck, Michael Jordan and Donald Trump are among the 15,327 who reportedly attend the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight boxing match at the Pyramid on June 8, 2002. Lewis knocks out Tyson in the 8th round in what at the time was the highest-grossing event in pay-per-view history.\n\n177. In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181. His fur was brown and shaggy, his belly was round and saggy: A slobby Everybear, the original version of Grizz, the Memphis Grizzlies mascot, is retired for the current blue-furred Superbear when the team moves from the Pyramid to FedExForum in 2004.\n\n182. A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W. Bush. \"Hold me close, hold me tight,\" sang Koizumi, as he put his arm around Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie Presley.\n\n186. An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat. Reports of the marine mammal's meanderings transfixed Memphians for several days, but the docile creature eluded capture and came to a sad end: It was found dead in December in McKellar Lake.\n\n187. Farewell to the Ape Girl, water-skiing squirrels and a life-sized Dolly Parton sculpted from butter: The last Mid-South Fair at the old Fairgrounds is held in 2008.\n\n188. A second printing of more than 40,000 copies quickly disappears as Memphians descend on The Commercial Appeal offices on Nov. 5, 2008, seeking souvenir editions of the newspaper that reported Barack Obama's presidential victory with a front-page headline that proclaimed \"Yes He Did\" — a play on the Obama campaign slogan, \"Yes We Can.\"\n\n189. Sept. 22, 2009: Memphis Mayor Pro Tem Myron Lowery greets the Dalai Lama with a fist bump and the comment: \"I've always wanted to say, 'Hello, Dalai!'\"\n\n190. Crews in January 2010, dismantle Elvis' favorite roller coaster, the 80-year-old Zippin Pippin, marking a definitive end to decades of amusement park rides at the Fairgrounds.

April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history. Finch led Memphis State to the 1973 NCAA title game against victorious UCLA that — however briefly — united the city.\n\n192. After a decade of planning, Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid opens to the public on April 29, 2015, bringing camo boots, duck decoys and live gators to the 14-year-old pyramid-shaped arena that had hosted the Tigers, Grizzlies, Bruce Springsteen and Prince.\n\n193. May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

Long distance information, give me Memphis, Missouri: Memphis, Tennessee, population 646,889 (according to the 2010 Census), may be the biggest Memphis in the United States, but it isn't the only one. Some others include Memphis, Florida, pop. 7,848; Memphis, Texas, 2,290; Memphis, Missouri, 1,822; Memphis, Nebraska, 114; Memphis, Mississippi, 70; and Memphis, Alabama, which, according to a 2017 estimate, has 28 residents.\n\n198.
