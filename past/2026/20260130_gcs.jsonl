Analysts had expected the earnings of 88 cents a share on $27.41 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe total layoffs are roughly twice what Whitman initially anticipated when she undertook a five-year turnaround plan at HP in late 2011.\n\n\"We don't anticipate an additional (layoff) program,\" Whitman told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"This company has been through a lot. … This is part of the program of integrating (major acquisitions), streamlining and automating processes.\"\n\n\"We feel good at the midpoint of our (five-year) turnaround plan,\" Whitman said. \"Stabilization of revenue, cash flow, network security, big data, innovation, R&D spending — I feel good about where we are.\"\n\nShares of HP were flat in after-hours trading, at $31.78. The company's shares touched a 52-week high of $33.90 in early April.\n\nHP made its name and fortune as a pioneer in business computing. But it has struggled the past few years to finesse the transition to mobile devices and the growing demand for cloud computing systems.\n\nWhile corporate rivals such as IBM have retreated from the low-margin hardware market, HP has bolstered its computing hardware business. Yet on Thursday, HP said revenue for its enterprise group, which sells computer servers and other hardware, slipped 2% to $6.66 billion in the second quarter.

It instructs heads of federal departments and agencies to make \"large-scale reductions in force.\"\n\nThe initial firings focused on – but weren't exclusive to – employees in their first year of their federal job, as they lack the ability longer-term employees have to appeal their terminations. Coupled with about 75,000 workers who took President Trump's buyouts, the job cuts amount to nearly 4% of the federal government's 2.3 million workers.\n\nOverall, about 220,000 federal workers of the total federal government workforce had less than one year of experience as of March 2024, according to the most recently publicly available data from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nHere's where firings have occurred so far.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau: Layoffs and a court challenge\n\nA federal judge on Friday blocked the dismissal of any more workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to multiple reports. More than 100 employees were laid off before the pause, NPR reported. A court challenge was filed by a union representing workers seeking to block Trump's efforts to eliminate the CFPB.\n\nDepartment of Education: Employees fired, put on leave\n\nTermination notices were sent to more than 60 probationary employees across multiple work groups, including the offices of general counsel, special education and rehabilitation services, and federal student aid. Dozens of employees have been put administrative leave, multiple outlets including the New York Times and Washington Post reported, amid the Trump administration's efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion positions from the government.\n\nPresident Trump has said he would like to dismantle the Education Department. Last week, Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, announced on X the department canceled nearly $1 billion in educational research contracts, severely limiting the agency's data-collecting arm.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nWhich agencies are being hit by DOGE? Education Department, USAID, NIH and more\n\nDepartment of Energy job cuts include nuclear agency firings\n\nAbout 1,200 to 2,000 workers in the department were terminated, including some at the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons fleet and secures radiological materials around the world. Less than 0.5% of the NNSA workforce was dismissed, an Energy Department spokesperson said in a statement. Some NNsA employees at first identified for dismissals were later reinstated, Jill Hruby, former NNSA administrator in the Biden administration, said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: CDC, NIH firings\n\nThousands of probationary employees were fired across the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), according to multiple reports\n\nRoughly 1,300 probational workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10% of the agency's workforce, were fired on Friday, the Associated Press and NPR reported.\n\nWorkers were also fired at the National Institutes of Health, where a \"huge\" number of nurses from the NIH Clinical Center were let go, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources. Some facilities may be forced to close due to staffing shortages.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security: Firings at several federal agencies\n\nMore than 400 employees, identified as \"non-mission critical personnel in probationary status,\" were fired at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to CBS News and ABC News.\n\nDepartment of the Interior: National Park Service hit with firings\n\nAt least 2,300 federal workers had their positions terminated. Among them were 800 Bureau of Land Management employees and about 1,000 National Park Service workers.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs: Firings yield $98 million\n\nMore than 1,000 of the department's about 43,000 probationary employees were terminated, producing an estimated savings of about $98 million, the department said.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency: 388 firings at federal agency\n\nThe agency fired 388 employees who were on probationary status \"after a thorough review of agency functions in accordance with President Trump’s executive orders,\" said Jeff Landis, an agency spokesman.\n\nGeneral Services Administration: Agency drops 100-plus workers\n\nMore than 100 probationary employees at the agency, which manages the nation's real estate portfolio, have been pressured into either resigning or facing being put on leave and then terminated, Reuters reported.\n\nInternal Revenue Service: Mass firings could be in the thousands\n\nThe IRS is preparing to fire thousands of workers next week, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. It was unclear how many thousands of employees would be fired at the IRS, which grew to about 100,000 people – including roughly 16,000 probationary workers – under the Biden Administration to increase its including its ability to audit corporations and wealthy taxpayers. Job cuts could affect the IRS' work to process upcoming tax returns, according to The New York Times, which first reported the expected layoffs.\n\nOffice of Personnel Management loses dozens of workers\n\nDozens of probationary employees at the agency, which had instructed other federal agencies to let go its probationary employees, also fired dozens of its own workers in a Thursday afternoon group call, CBS News and CNN reported.\n\nSmall Business Administration: About 20% of workers fired\n\nAbout 20% of the agency's staff, or about 720 SBA employees, including hundreds of probationary employees, were fired, Politico reported.\n\nU.S. Forest Service: About 3,400 workers fired\n\nThe agency, which is within the Department of Agriculture, fired about 3,400 probational workers, or nearly 10% of the Forest Service workforce of 35,000 employees. A source familiar with the cuts told USA TODAY the layoffs do not include firefighters, law enforcement officers, bridge inspectors or meteorologists.\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n\nAbout 10,000 USAID employees, excluding essential personnel, were placed on administrative leave last week.\n\nContributing: Reuters and Zachary Schermele of USA TODAY.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Threads, Bluesky and X: mikegsnider &@mikegsnider.bsky.social &@mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

That's not our plan,\" said Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon.\n\nRising AI adoption\n\nThe job cuts also underscore how artificial intelligence is changing corporate workforce dynamics. Significant improvements in AI assistants are helping enterprises execute duties from routine administrative tasks to complex coding problems with rapid speed and precision, driving widespread adoption.\n\nJassy had said last summer that the increased use of AI tools would lead to more automation of duties, resulting in corporate job losses.\n\nEarlier in January, top executives at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting said while jobs would disappear, new ones would spring up, with two of them telling Reuters that AI would be used as an excuse by companies planning to cut jobs anyway.\n\nThe 30,000 jobs would together represent a small portion of Amazon's 1.58 million employees, but nearly 10% of its corporate workforce. The majority of Amazon's workers are in fulfillment centers and warehouses.\n\nTech giants, including Amazon, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft, had sharply ramped up hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic demand surge and have lately been restructuring their workforce.\n\nAmazon has also been investing in robotics at its warehouses to speed up packaging and deliveries for its e-commerce segment, reduce the reliance on human labor and cutting costs.\n\nThe company is set to report quarterly results Feb. 5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/04/24/t-union-prepping-strike-details-deep-layoffs-counter-tax-reform-vows/541335002/", "title": "AT&T union preps strike, lists layoffs it says counter tax reform vows", "text": "Updated April 24, 2018, 2:36 p.m. ET\n\nA major union preparing to strike against AT&T has compiled a detailed report of U.S. layoffs and call center closures that it says shows the telecom giant has violated its own post-tax reform promises.\n\nThe Communications Workers of America, which is in ongoing contract talks with AT&T on behalf of 14,000 workers in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, as well as its nationwide Legacy T contract, says the company has been cutting call center workers in favor of outsourcing, despite its promises to invest in its workers after President Trump's sweeping tax cuts.\n\nIn December, AT&T issued $1,000 bonuses to more than 200,000 employees after the tax reform bill's passage. The company also promised to increase investment in the U.S. and, the union charges, implied hiring increases.\n\nHowever, the union says over the past seven years, AT&T has laid off 16,000 call center workers nationwide, while closing 44 call centers, according to a CWA report out today — an early copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY. Many of those jobs have been outsourced to call centers in countries including Canada, Colombia and El Salvador, the union says, and it continued that trend in December.\n\nAT&T counters that the CWA “consistently fails to point out\" that the company has hired more than 87,000 in the U.S. in the last three years (17,000 in 2017) and is currently looking to hire thousands more in 2018, said AT&T spokesman Marty Richter. Most union workers are offered another job with the company if their job is eliminated, he said.\n\nBut the union charges that the jobs cuts that are occurring unfairly hurt longtime employees, in favor of outsourced and contracted labor. \"The outsourcing has created a sense of insecurity for folks,\" said Linda Hinton, CWA's AT&T Midwest vice president.\n\n\"(AT&T CEO) Randall Stephenson has said on several occasions he was committed to raising wages and creating good-paying jobs,\" she said. \"We are trying to hold his feet to the fire on this. This is what you said, and this is what we expect.\"\n\nThe report is the latest salvo in the battle between unions and major corporations over who gets to reap rewards from the tax reform measures passed in 2017. AT&T was an early and vocal supporter of the tax cuts. The CWA and other unions have pressured companies to reveal the size of their tax windfall and what they plan to do with it — and what portion would be used to raise wages, bring back jobs from overseas and make capital investments.\n\nIn November 2017, Stephenson announced his support for the tax-reform measure and, in December after its passage, said, “This tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs. In fact, we will increase our U.S. investment and pay a special bonus to our U.S. employees.\"\n\nWhen it reported its fourth-quarter 2017 financials, AT&T said that tax reform helped boost the quarter's net income to $19 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in the same period a year before.\n\n\n\nAT&T gave out those $1,000 bonuses — $200 million in bonus payments total — and $800 million in funding to its employee and retiree medical trust, Richter says.\n\nBut it also announced 1,540 layoffs across the U.S. in December, the union says. Layoffs included more than 430 call center workers. Others affected were technicians, with the largest group (590) being installation technicians who set up equipment in customer homes, the union says.\n\nOver the past two years, the company has closed four call centers in Michigan and Ohio, the union says, and has laid off 2,300 workers in the past three years in Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.\n\nAT&T is adjusting its workforce in parts of the country where it's seeing lower demand for legacy services such as landline and DSL services, AT&T's Richter says, and adding workers where there's increased demand for products and services.\n\nAt a call center in Appleton, Wis., where 400 employees worked three years ago, now only about 30 workers remain. Those workers constantly worry about their own jobs being cut, says Betsy LaFontaine, a union member who has worked there for almost 30 years. \"What frustrates me is, at the end of the year when the tax law changed, ... there were promises there was going to be investment, domestic job growth and they were going to expand infrastructure,\" she said. \"At this particular point, it seems that promise is being broken, based on what is going on in the negotiations.\"\n\nThe union membership has authorized a strike if negotiations on the contract, which expired April 14, do not prove fruitful.\n\n\"They are looking for the cheapest possible labor handling sensitive information,\" LaFontaine said.\n\nIn 2015, AT&T paid $25 million as part of a settlement with the Federal Communications Commission into breaches at its call centers in Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines. Other countries with AT&T call centers include Canada, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Jamaica.\n\nAT&T has, in the past, agreed to bring back some outsourced jobs during negotiations with the CWA. These included negotiations last year involving 3,000 jobs at AT&T Southwest, the union notes. And two years ago, an agreement with CWA and Verizon brought back 1,300 call center jobs in the northeast and mid-Atlantic states.\n\n\"We certainly know that technology will change things,\" Hinton said, \"but it shouldn’t for the American worker actually when we can be trained to do it.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/03/13/canton-mill-closing-hope-environmental-mental-health-risks/69994555007/", "title": "Canton mill closing: hope, environmental, mental health risks", "text": "March 13, 2023, 5:09 a.m. ET\n\nWAYNESVILLE - The stunningly fast shutdown of a paper mill that has employed local workers for 125 years will be a \"gut punch\" to the region, but it will come at a time when unemployment is historically low and manufacturing and other jobs are plentiful, officials have said.\n\nIn a March 10 press conference that was largest gathering of elected and other officials since the announced summer shutdown of the Canton paper mill, speakers projected hope and promised aid for more than 1,000 shocked workers and their families.\n\n\"This paper mill, while important for many, many decades, does not define who we are. Who we are is defined by our spirit, our mountain heritage, our fight and is powered by our belief in God,\" said Congressman Chuck Edwards, the highest-ranking elected official of those gathered at Haywood Community College.\n\nMayor Zeb Smathers, also in office during the area's 2021 deadly flood, agreed there were \"better days ahead.\"\n\nBut, speaking at one point through tears, Smathers warned that it would be a long, difficult process, similar to the death of a family member. A broad range of assistance would be needed, \"especially mental health,\" he said, referencing the 2003 layoff of 4,800 North Carolina workers to the east when the Kannopolis-based Pillowtex Corporation went bankrupt.\n\n\"They had 70 suicides,\" he said, repeating the number for emphasis. \"These are mill workers that went home and faced their family and their kids and also faced those mortgage payments sitting on the table.\"\n\nThe impact of the Canton mill shutdown stretches outside Haywood County, with 40% of plant employees coming from Buncombe County.\n\nIllinois-based Pactiv-Evergreen said the mill's closing was part of a company wide restructuring. Since the March 6 announcement, the corporation faced criticism for deciding to pay dividends to the shareholders while announcing the layoff of 1,200 Western North Carolina workers plus those at a soon-to-be-shuttered Ohio plant. In addition, four top Pactiv officials drew allegations of insider trading after selling more than $600,000 in stock three days before the layoff announcement and the tanking of the company's share values.\n\nEdwards has called on Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler to investigate. After the press conference he said he expected a response from the chair to \"take a few weeks.\"\n\n\"I simply believe it looks suspicious. And I believe that the people here in Haywood County deserve to know if there was trading that took place on insider information,\" the Republican WNC congressman said.\n\nResponding to the allegations, Pactiv spokesperson Beth Kelly said the sales were done automatically with proceeds going to cover tax withholdings. Kelly did not respond to March 10 questions asking that, even if legal, officials regretted taking profits at the same time they laid off workers.\n\nThe speed and suddenness of the closing − the plant will shut in the summer − added to shock. With some companies, warnings about layoffs are given months, even years, ahead, officials said.\n\n'It is a dangerous place'\n\nSmathers and Local United Steel Workers Union President Troy Dills pointed to environmental and safety concerns. The flood two years ago caused equipment failure and an explosion in the mill in which two individuals were \"horribly burned,\" Dills said.\n\nShutting down a paper mill requires a special process with the right staff in place, said Dills, adding that he believes that plan may not exist.\n\n\"That 150-acre campus has got all sorts of chemicals. It is a dangerous place. Inherently paper mills are dangerous,\" he said.\n\nAid to workers and others indirectly affected would come from the federal, state and local levels, they said. That could include food assistance, health care and job retraining. Dills said the assistance sounded very good for workers, but it also needed to be extended to family members who might have to take on new jobs. Mill workers average $25 an hour but almost universally work overtime with 50 hours a week not uncommon. Those laid off are to get a week's pay for every year, the union president said, though much of that compensation is to be negotiated.\n\nOn a positive note, Nathan Ramsey, The Land of Sky Regional Council's Mountain Area Workforce Development Board director, said economic conditions are very favorable to job seekers.\n\nThe region's unemployment is around 2.5%, the best in the state, Ramsey said. And while the closure wipes out many manufacturing jobs, others remain.\n\n\"We have over 1,200 manufacturing jobs in the Asheville metro and the greater region. We have over 16,000 job openings in total. So there are opportunities for these workers to find good paying jobs,\" Ramsey said.\n\nJoel Burgess has lived in WNC for more than 20 years, covering politics, government and other news.

Republicans decried the audit campaign as an assault on middle-class Americans and small businesses.\n\nAccording to the IRS in 2023, it was not increasing audit rates on households making less than $400,000 per year, which is roughly 98% of taxpayers. Research shows that every dollar spent auditing a household making more than $400,000 brings in $4 in additional revenue, so the Biden administration argued that the increased IRS enforcement actually saved the government money. A recent analysis by researchers at Yale University found if the IRS lost 18,200 workers it would spend $1.4 billion less but the smaller staff would generate $8.3 billion less in tax revenue.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been slashing spending across the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk. The IRS has been in turmoil, with three leaders since January.\n\nActing IRS Commissioner Melanie Krause is among those resigning.

This week the Walt Disney Co. began its second round of job eliminations, cutting several thousand positions as part of a broader plan to cut 7,000 jobs that will affect various divisions including its TV networks and theme parks.\n\nAmazon also initiated its latest round of cuts on Wednesday, according to a message to employees from Adam Selipsky, CEO of the company's cloud computing division, AWS.\n\n\"As you know, we recently made the difficult decision to eliminate some roles across Amazon globally, including within AWS,'' he wrote. \"I wanted to let you know that conversations with impacted AWS employees started today, with notification messages sent to all impacted employees in the U.S., Canada, and Costa Rica.\"\n\nAmazon said in March that it would be getting rid of 9,000 more jobs, cuts following the elimination of roughly 18,000 other positions in recent months.\n\nSeveral other companies including McDonald's, Lyft and Meta have announced they are slashing jobs, citing reasons ranging from declining ad revenue to a need to streamline.\n\nWhy are so many layoffs happening?\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the waves of job cuts in the tech industry where tens of thousands of jobs have been shed. But a key reason that sector appears so hard hit is that it was so aggressive in hiring workers before the pandemic.\n\nIn the five years preceding the global health crisis, tech companies added 1.3 million workers, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by CompTIA, an information-technology trade group.\n\nThe pandemic accelerated the need for more tech workers in order to get products to consumers who were increasingly shopping online and who also had additional cash to buy gaming systems, computers and other electronics thanks to stimulus checks from the government and enhanced unemployment insurance.\n\nBut that extra money has begun to dry up and consumers are pulling back on spending. The Federal Reserve also began raising interest rates to tame rising inflation, sending tech stocks plunging and companies began to lay off workers they no longer needed or said they could no longer afford to keep on the payroll.\n\nIs a recession coming: Most corporate economists don't see a slump happening within a year.\n\nMarch jobs report; what is the unemployment rate?\n\nThe economy added 236,000 jobs in March, and the jobless rate hovered at 3.5%, with 5.8 million Americans out of work.\n\nGDP report today\n\nThe economy is continuing to grow but at a weaker pace, and many experts predict the U.S. will experience a mild recession before the end of the year.\n\nThe nation’s gross domestic product, which represents the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.1% during the first three months of the year, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nHowever, economists polled by Bloomberg had predicted a 2% increase, and the small uptick was far less than the 3.2% GDP growth experienced in the third quarter, and 2.6% increase seen in the last quarter of the year.\n\nNext Fed Interest Rate Hike Meeting\n\nThe latest jobless claims report comes on the eve of another key announcement that can signal or impact the health of the economy.\n\nThe Fed is scheduled to meet on May 2 and 3, revealing whether it will continue the stream of interest rate hikes it's implemented to dampen inflation.\n\nAmid the financial chaos that ensued after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March, Fed officials raised a key short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point last month. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that if financial institutions made it harder to borrow in the wake of SVB's failure, the Fed \"may have less work to do'' going forward.\n\nIf there is another rate increase, Fed officials have forecasted another quarter-point hike to a peak range of 5% to 5.25%, which is consistent with an estimate it made in December and lower than what many economy watchers anticipated before SVB's demise.\n\nJobless claims report schedule\n\nThe initial jobless claims report is released every Thursday.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press, Paul Davidson, Elisabeth Buchwald", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/nation/2025/02/18/did-donald-trump-fire-faa-workers/79061812007/", "title": "Did Donald Trump fire FAA workers?

The Department of Transportation barred airlines that accepted stimulus money from laying off employees until at least Oct. 1, when $25 billion in payroll support protection money from the CARES Act expires.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate failed to reach the 60-vote minimum needed to pass a slimmed-down, $300 billion GOP coronavirus relief package that didn't allocate any aid for the airline industry.

President Donald Trump backed the concept during a news conference last month. And 16 Republican senators sent a letter in support of the plan, it was widely reported.\n\nChange fees are history: Alaska, Delta, American and United all ditching change fees on US flights\n\nIn July, United originally predicted that it would cut as many as 36,000 positions, about a third of its total workforce, before revising that number to 16,000 earlier this month.\n\nThe pilots’ union at United Airlines announced Wednesday it has reached an agreement with the carrier to prevent the furlough of nearly 3,000 pilots when a federal prohibition on job cuts ends Oct. 1. The Air Line Pilots Association notified members about the deal, which would need to be ratified by pilots.\n\nUnited pilots off the hook? Union says it has a deal with airline to prevent nearly 3,000 pilot furloughs\n\nAmerican said late last month that it will need a reduction of 17,500, an improvement over the 25,000 it originally predicted in July but still a staggering number.\n\n\"It's clear that travel jobs, which were hit by far the hardest of any sector, won't recover on their own,\" said Tori Barnes, an executive vice president for the U.S. Travel Association, in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAirline capacity has slowly picked up over the summer, but not quickly enough. From an April low of less than 10%, it had risen to 51% by last week, according to the industry trade group Airlines for America. That's still considerably lower than the 85% capacity rate of 2019. And the association said it doesn't expect to see those kinds of numbers again until 2024.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, it's looking grim for airline employees.\n\n\"Where will we go?

In Minneapolis, the administration also tied the surge to an ongoing federal fraud investigation, which included a number of people in the region's Somali-American community, the vast majority of whom are naturalized citizens or U.S. born.\n\nRenee Nicole Good, 37, was killed when video showed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent firing into her car on a Minneapolis street.

I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Tuesday, December 16th, 2025. To answer those questions and more, USA TODAY National Correspondents Trevor Hughes and Lauren Villagran spent three days with ICE agents in Kansas City, part of the Chicago Field Office tasked with immigration enforcement in a sprawling six-state region of the Midwest. I will mention here that some of the agents profiled here were not comfortable using their full names in this reporting. Trevor and Lauren, thank you so much for joining me.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nGood to be here.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nThanks, Dana.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nLauren, I want to start with your reporting on the family of ICE agents that you spent time with. Who are they and how did their involvement with the agency evolve?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nSo we spent time with an actual family of ICE agents. Dad joined the force when it was still the Immigration and Naturalization Service, just as it was becoming ICE in the wake of 9/11. His kids, Danielle, the eldest daughter, and twin younger brothers all were federal workers and eventually followed in their father's footsteps and became ICE agents. The three kids last year completed the ICE Academy during a presidential election in which immigration was the central debate. The father, Robert, was coming up on retirement, mandatory retirement at age 57, and he ultimately left the force in May only to be called back in June by the Trump administration. And when he got that email offering retirees to come back to the force, he jumped at the opportunity, and now he and his kids work together for the agency.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThe perspective of the agents themselves have been notably absent from the public conversation about the arrests and deportations. And I'd like to ask you both what the agents you spoke with shared with you here. Trevor, I'll start with you.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nThese are folks who see themselves as very much law and order Americans. These are people who in many cases were former police officers, former military, who deeply love our country and believe that they are serving its best interests by carrying out these immigration enforcements. One of the things that we heard over and over was the pendulum swings back and forth between presidents. President Biden had a more lax approach to immigration enforcement. President Trump has a much stricter approach to immigration enforcement. And so there is this sense within the agency as a whole and with the folks that we talk to that they now have the opportunity to enforce the laws that are on the books that have been written by Congress. And so they are enforcing what the elected representatives of Americans have voted for.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nNow, it's important to remember that immigration enforcement today looks a lot different than it did a year ago, not only because of presidential politics or the policies of the current or even former administrations. The Trump administration has dramatically expanded the number of law enforcement officers who are working on immigration enforcement. So whereas a year ago, ICE had 6,000 deportation officers, the folks who were out on the street making targeted arrests in the interior of the country, today, the Trump administration has assigned more than 15,000 federal law enforcement officers to the task of immigration enforcement. That also includes Border Patrol, CBP, FBI, DEA, a number of three letter agencies. So the style and focus of enforcement is not only in ICE's hands, but in the hands of a broad swath of really rapidly involving leadership on immigration enforcement.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nTrevor, Trump has said agents are prioritizing \"the worst of the worst,\" but statistics show that nearly half of those arrested by ICE and about three quarters of those in detention have no pending criminal charges or convictions. Did the agents acknowledge this? What did they tell you?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nThere is a sense among the agents that the ones that we spent time with, and it's important to bear in mind that we saw a very narrow slice of how things are done, but what we saw was targeted enforcement of people with criminal records, with convictions, with deportation orders. But the agents do acknowledge that there is a sort of a broader enforcement action going on. And I think they are really feeling the pressure from Americans, which is why we got the access we did. They're really frustrated that they're out there arresting people with criminal records, people who have convictions for child abuse or sexual assaults or drunk driving, and they're out there making those arrests. And the American public is instead focusing on some of the other detentions they're seeing that are, in many cases, being done by other agencies.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nFor many Americans, this year is the first time that they are seeing federal agents conduct immigration enforcement in a really massive way on American city streets. In the border zone, communities from Tucson to El Paso to San Diego have had long experience with federal immigration enforcement. For much of America, this is brand new. And so I think there is certainly a lot of friction there. And one of the agents we spoke with expressed it this way, saying that as the public increasingly distrusts immigration enforcement, it's made it also hard for agents to trust the public. And that is one of the reasons why they are wearing masks, which is a huge debate right now about whether law enforcement officers should be masked.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nTrevor, our listeners probably know the response to masked federal agents in major American cities has included shootings, attacks on ICE facilities, vehicles being rammed into. You would think that would pose a real obstacle to recruitment. What did agents tell you about their sense of personal safety?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nOh, I mean, these are folks who are absolutely concerned about their personal safety every single day. They talk about checking the buildings to make sure there's no one stalking them. They park their cars in different places. They're vague when they talk to community members about what it is that they actually do for a living. What we heard though is that there are quite a lot of ICE agents who are joining the force. The Trump administration has really put out the call, they're dangling very significant incentives, helping people get rid of student loans, lots and lots of overtime here. And so there are quite a lot of people who are joining up, even though they know there has been a significant increase in assaults and attacks against ICE agents and other immigration officers.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nTo be sure, there is a aggressive recruitment campaign by DHS, by the Department of Homeland Security to bring on new immigration enforcement officers. And while legacy officers, some of them may be uncomfortable in the new environment in which there is a sharp spotlight on their work, and in some cases, that's putting them in danger, there are new recruits out there who are joining because of this enforcement style and strategy. And I think the one thing that we know for sure is that a year from now, immigration enforcement in this country is going to look dramatically different than it even does today. It's something that is going to be growing and going to be more ubiquitous across the country.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nTrevor, you wrote about how ICE agents who've been around since Biden feel about Trump's shift in tactics with regards to immigrants here illegally. Can you elaborate on that for me?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nThere is a sense among the ICE agents and the ICE officers that I talked to that they now have the opportunity to enforce the laws as written. There has been this sense of the pendulum swinging back and forth, but a lot of these folks who are law and order kinds of people get very frustrated when they see someone breaking a law and they feel like they're not allowed to enforce that law in the way they think it should be done. And President Trump has really said to them, \"Go out and essentially arrest as many people as you can, detain as many people as you can.\" That in some ways runs counter to how long time ICE officers have worked, which is targeted enforcement, the worst of the worst.\n\nBut there is this sense that the American public is seeing a new kind of enforcement, and that is really changing the relationship between ICE and the communities that it serves across America. And so I think some of the newer agents signed up for this, right? They're joining the agency at a time when the Trump administration has very strongly recruited them precisely to do this kind of work. And some of the agents and officers who've been there a long time, it's a shift for them.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nI mean, look, according to the Migration Policy Institute, roughly six million migrants entered the country under what the Biden administration called lawful pathways, either seeking asylum or getting some kind of parole into the country. Those programs, while not challenged in a court of law, were widely viewed by Republicans and many law enforcement officers as being illegitimate. And so there is, I think it can't be underestimated how a swath of the American public, certainly millions of voters viewed that influx of migrants in the wake of a pandemic during a period of economic strife across the globe. There was a lot of anger. And what we're seeing today in terms of, again, as Trevor has mentioned, the pendulum swinging back, is an effort to remove many of those people. Or in the case of those who hold temporary protected status, seeing their status stripped away.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nLauren, a lot of the conversation on social media has to do with what people see as an escalation and aggression as to how the arrests are being executed with agents smashing windows, violently pulling people from their cars. You rode along with agents when they were making arrests. Can you describe what you witnessed?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nTwice this year, once during the Biden administration and recently in Kansas City with Trump in office, I've been on a ride along with ICE agents and I've seen how they prefer to work. Typically, ICE officers, deportation officers conduct surveillance for days or weeks on a given target who they know has a criminal record. As Trevor mentioned, it's usually a very serious criminal record, and they prefer to make a quiet arrest, swoop in, arrest the person in a vehicle stop, preferably with not too many members of the public around for the public safety and the safety of the agents. And that's the sort of targeted arrest that we witnessed in Kansas City in November.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nOne thing that's interesting to note is that the ICE agents that we talk to, they are seeing an escalation in the force that's used against them. And you have to bear in mind that they are police officers, and police officers are trained to use a continuum of force. And so if someone they're trying to detain knows that detention likely means deportation, which is frankly what it means for many, many people these days. Under the Biden administration, you might have been detained, but you would've been paroled back into the community and you could work and live. These days, what we're hearing more and more is that if you are sort of detained under the Trump administration, it's unlikely you're coming back out of detention.\n\nThe ICE officers that we saw, they understand that they're dealing with folks who have a lot to lose now. And so they are concerned that they are going to deal with fights, they're going to deal with force. And then you also have community members who don't necessarily understand what's happening, who do see these social media videos of these seemingly random detention sweeps with officers sort of walking through a community, grabbing people from a car wash, grabbing people from a field willy-nilly rather than with some sort of warrant or some sort of target list. And so you have this kind of toxic mix of escalation, and that's being met by further escalation on both sides.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nIt's important to note that immigrant families, immigrant communities are now, after roughly nine months of this increased enforcement, terrified. So even people who don't have a criminal record, people who may not even be immigrants, but who may be targeted because of their race or where they work are fearful and are reacting in many cases out of that fear. So the law enforcement officers are operating in a very tense environment.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nAnd what we've also seen from experts is a concern that the tactics that not just ICE agents are using, but border patrol are using, that that is fraying the bonds between communities and police agencies who are not conducting immigration enforcement. Following the murder of George Floyd, there was a lot of talk about reforming police departments, and many, many police departments across the country have worked really, really hard to build relationships with immigrant communities on the theory that if you are hurt or attacked or something in America, that the justice system is on your side, will work with you. And so now a lot of local police departments have concerns about the tactics that they're seeing because they feel like it really violates the trust that they've been trying to build with those immigrant communities.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nI want to ask you both this. The agents have wide discretion over the immigrants on their docket, meaning they can also hold the fate of immigrant families in their hands. What did they tell you about how they wield that power?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nWe heard a lot from the agents about how careful and respectful they are. I mean, they work with, or are in many cases, former police officers who have spent a lot of time training on due process and constitutional rights. And so we heard over and over their commitment to following the law, to making sure that people did have their day in court, whether that was criminal court or immigration court. We heard from them about how they treat pregnant people, how they treat single parents. And so the folks that we spent time with are very aware of how much power they have when it comes to pulling families apart. And they really understand the impact that it has on those families, but at the same time, they also understand their obligations as enforcement officers under this White House.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nAnd again, I think it's impossible to tell the story about this particular office in Kansas City without acknowledging that it's a microcosm existing in a larger context in which, again, there are thousands of other law enforcement officers and border agents on immigration enforcement, and there are specific operations that are sweeping through cities meant to surge enforcement in a way that may be less targeted, as we've seen in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans, and now Minneapolis. So again, it's an evolving situation in which both the American public and law enforcement officers, immigration agents and officers are really creating and living through a new reality.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nLauren Villagran and Trevor Hughes are USA TODAY National Correspondents.

In the years since, she has noticed big changes: Minneapolis is bigger and more prosperous now, and \"it's because of the immigrants,\" said the 59-year-old who now teaches Somali language in the local public schools. \"We are really contributing to the betterment of the country.\"\n\nBut now her community has once again become a point of focus in conservative circles since Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris chose Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate.\n\nWithin hours of Harris announcing her pick, social media was riddled with the false rumor that Walz fashioned the state’s new flag to resemble Somalia’s. Stephen Miller, former senior Trump advisor and a close confidante, piled on by saying Harris and Walz planned to “turn the entire Midwest into Mogadishu,” the capital city of Somalia. An article from Fox News published a week after the VP announcement suggested Walz’s immigration policy contributed to a rise in Somali gangs.\n\nThese attacks aren't new. Former President Donald Trump has specifically targeted Somali immigrants in every campaign cycle in Minnesota since he first ran for president in 2016, a local variation on the anti-immigration rhetoric he's long embraced. Before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Trump's team claimed Republicans would win the reliably blue state this November, as they said in 2020.\n\nA key difference is that a brand new Democratic ticket has given Trump an opening to go after Harris and Walz on their biggest Achilles' heel: immigration and the border.\n\nThe rhetoric is just \"politics,\" Yossuf said in an interview just days before Walz would formally accept his party's nomination some 400 miles away at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nBut she said she has also noticed a few of Trump's campaign promises have rattled members of the Minnesotan immigrant community, including the 2024 Republican presidential nominee's proposal to enact mass deportations and reinstitute a travel ban on majority-Muslim countries. Others who spoke with USA TODAY similarly expressed concerns that anti-immigrant rhetoric in this year's election could create a more hostile environment for transplants.\n\n\"Making people fear all that, I think, is wrong,\" she said. Most of the East African immigrants she knows fled hardship, are in the U.S. legally, and are working hard and paying taxes, thanks to refugee resettlement policies, she said. \"So to demean them and make that they are nothing, it’s not right.”\n\nAt least 44,000 Minnesota residents were born in Somalia and another 29,000 first-generation Somali Americans call the state home, according to data compiled by Minnesota Compass.\n\nIn the decades since the first wave of Somali migrants came to the state, they have established flourishing cultural and business districts, sent their children to its colleges and universities, and elected leaders from their own communities to Minnesota's city councils, mayorships, legislature and to the U.S. Congress.\n\nThey have also been met with some resistance in the predominantly white and Christian Midwest state of 5.7 million people – including everything from violent threats and vandalism to general racial and religious tensions. Somali immigrants have been the focus of local efforts to stop refugee resettlement and have feared targeting by local police. The community's most high-profile elected official – U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. – has been a frequent target of anti-Muslim threats and rumors, including from Trump himself.\n\nStill, most Minnesotans have been welcoming, according to around a dozen Minnesota Somali community members, leaders and allies who spoke with USA TODAY, and generous state policies for refugee resettlement, most recently championed by Walz, has made the state a popular destination for East Africans fleeing dangerous conditions back home.\n\nIn the national political spotlight\n\nDuring a visit to Minnesota in July – for a campaign rally in St. Cloud, where some local opposition to Somali refugee resettlement has gained national attention – Trump said Harris wants to “deposit thousands of jihadist sympathizers in Minnesota.”\n\n“You know that, you already have enough,” he added. “I mean, how the hell do you have these Congresspeople elected – Ilhan Omar,” who is the first Somali American to serve in Congress.\n\n\"On Day 1 of the Trump presidency, I will restore the travel ban, suspend refugee admission, stop the resettlement, and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country,\" he added, referencing the 2017 travel ban from majority-Muslim countries – including Somalia – as he addressed the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas against Israel.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Harris is allowing \"a border invasion of illegal immigrants from all over the world.\"\n\n\"It's hurting ALL Americans, regardless of race, and ESPECIALLY minority Americans in inner cities, where illegal immigrants are taking up housing supply and committing heinous crimes,\" she said. \"President Trump wants to put ALL American citizens first, including those who LEGALLY immigrated to this country.\"\n\nSalman Fiqy, a Republican who recently lost a state House primary, supports Trump and attended the rally in St. Cloud. He argued Republicans could win over Somali voters, who often share socially conservative values with the GOP, if they took a different approach.\n\n“It’s the same mistake that they did in 2020. I think it’s very, very sad,” Fiqy said. Biden won Minnesota in 2020 by 7.2 percentage points. “I was thinking that the Republican Party is going to wise up this time around, that they would tone down that populist, race-based, ethnic-based politics to rally up their voter base. I think that’s the reason why now they’re losing momentum, honestly.”\n\nWelcoming policy, economy bring refugees to Minnesota\n\nIn the Minneapolis Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, nicknamed “Little Mogadishu,” immigrants and their families dine at Somali restaurants filled with the smells of cumin, coriander and turmeric, shop at grocery stores stocked with everything from halal meats and halwa to camel milk, and advertise for local political campaigns, social services and community events in both Somali and English.\n\nNearby, a spacious indoor mall is packed with stalls selling Somali clothing, housewares, food and services to help new immigrants send money to loved ones in East Africa. Calls to prayer play five times per day over the loudspeaker and echo through the winding hallways, inviting shoppers to the mosque upstairs.\n\nIt's a sliver of the expansive Somali community that grew in Minnesota because of the state's generous social services, good public schools, low housing costs and plentiful employment opportunities, said Ahmed \"Jaffer\" Mohamed, a refugee resettlement coordinator for the Minnesota Council of Churches. In addition to the large number of Somali residents, Minnesota is home to the country’s second-largest Hmong population, who fled Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War.\n\nWalz did not initiate those policies, but he has expanded upon them in the nearly six years since he's been in office. When Trump as president signed an executive order in 2019 allowing state and local governments more power to reject incoming refugees, Walz approved continued resettlements. Later, Walz approved programs providing drivers licenses, free college tuition and health insurance to undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"Minnesota has a strong moral tradition of welcoming those who seek refuge,\" Walz wrote in a letter to the Trump administration's State Department affirming that the state would continue to accept refugees. \"Refugees strengthen our communities. Bringing new cultures and fresh perspectives, they contribute to the social fabric of our state. Opening businesses and supporting existing ones, they are critical to the success of our economy.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign did not respond to requests for comment from USA TODAY for this story.\n\nRich Stanek, a Republican who served as Hennepin County Sheriff from 2007 to 2019, said he believes it's a good thing that Minnesota is a welcoming state, but he still criticized Walz's tenure.\n\n\"The issue is, Gov. Walz, under his administration the last six years has been so welcoming to the extent that he's cut out local law enforcement,\" he said. He cited Walz's letter welcoming additional migrants and said he didn't tell police \"when they're coming, who's coming, doesn't give us the names, doesn't tell us how they fare in terms of being in the country legally, illegally.\"\n\nMost Somali residents who spoke with USA TODAY said they hadn't heard what Trump and conservative commentators were saying about refugees in Minnesota. But they also didn't say they were surprised.\n\nAhmed Ali, 32, moved to Mankato – where Walz himself lived for decades – from Somalia nearly five years ago. He thinks Walz has been a good governor, especially because of the school lunch program he approved last year, but had a conversation recently with a neighbor who disagreed, saying he has done too much to support undocumented immigrants.\n\nAsked how that felt as an immigrant himself, Ali said his neighbor \"has the right to question who is coming into this country if that is affecting him, the way he lives. If there is going to be job competition, you have the right to ask. If there is a resources issue, do we have the resources to accommodate people?”\n\nBut he said Trump is “trying to scare the Midwestern people” with comments like those he made in St. Cloud.\n\n“There’s a lot of people who are not open minded, people who never travel, people who are never exposed to other cultures,” he said. “Those people may believe what Donald Trump may say.”\n\nChanging attitudes on welcoming immigrants\n\nPeriodically, white Minnesota residents renew complaints against their Somali neighbors or a scandal deepens distrust. A decade ago, dozens of Somali youth were targeted in jihadi recruitment, something that even got the attention of the Obama administration. Recently, Minnesotan Somalis were at the nexus of a massive fraud case involving a nonprofit taking advantage of federal COVID relief funding - a topic that House Republicans in Washington are now investigating.\n\n“Somalis are just like other human beings. There are criminals among them, there are towering civic figures among them,” said Abdi Ismail Samatar, a geography professor at the University of Minnesota who came to the U.S. from Somalia.\n\nOverall, “the population in Minnesota are very thoughtful people,” Samatar said, and make judgments based on their own experiences – now, decades since their migration to Minnesota began, with Somali community members working at every professional level.\n\n“For former President Trump to use Somalis as bait says more about him than it says about the country and the communities he’s talking to,\" Samatar said.\n\nFor example, in St. Cloud, where Trump held his most recent rally and where Somali refugee resettlement has been a point of contention for years, candidates championing restrictions on refugee resettlement have lost elections in recent years. Now two Somali candidates are running for a seat on the local city council, beating out ten other candidates in a crowded primary last month.\n\nHamse Warfa is a Somali Minnesotan who previously worked in state government for the Walz administration and at the State Department under President Joe Biden. He is now volunteering for the Walz campaign around the country.\n\nHow welcoming native-born Minnesotans have been has ebbed and flowed over time, Warfa said. \"I feel as it gets closer to the election, unfortunately there are some politicians that create more divisions.\"\n\n\"I'm a strong believer that everything rises or falls on leadership,\" he said. He visited St. Cloud a few weeks before Trump to speak to the local Somali community: \"My message to Somali Americans was that this is your country as much as it is for Donald Trump.\"\n\nYossuf, the Somali teacher, said she has come to that conclusion herself.\n\n\"People who have seen a lot of problems really are the best citizens,\" she said. \"We are very committed to vote because we have seen what without democracy is.\"\n\nShe remembered the authoritarianism and violent rivalries that drove the Somali diaspora for decades, and argued that racial, religious and ethnic divisions in the U.S. can get in the way of all the opportunity her adopted home has to offer.\n\n\"I have seen Arabia, I have seen Europe, I have seen Africa. I really feel America is the best country. If you follow the rules and do the best you can, you really reach very high,\" Yossuf said. \"It's the only place I feel when people say the sky is the limit, it's true.\"\n\nYossuf described herself as a storyteller because she reads and sings to children in Somali at the local library, or maybe, as she said with a laugh, because she \"likes to talk.\" But she also tells her peers as often as she can about the rights they have in their new home in Minnesota and the United States, to vote and to tell the nation their own story – regardless of who holds the microphone on the campaign trail.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/05/sean-spicers-white-house-press-briefings-every-skype-question/419484001/", "title": "Sean Spicer's White House press briefings: Every Skype question", "text": "Updated July 5, 2017, 11:11 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON — White House press secretary Sean Spicer — and his deputy, Sarah Sanders — took questions via Skype 32 times in his five months as press secretary.\n\nLocal reporters from all over the country had the opportunity to question the White House officials directly. USA TODAY research found that 72% of Skype questions came from states Trump won in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRelated:\n\nWhen seasoned Washington reporters ask hard questions, Sean Spicer turns to Skype\n\nHere's a transcript of every question asked over Skype and every answer provided from the podium:\n\nKIM KALUNIAN, WPRI, Providence, R.I. (Feb. 1): \"Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island began calling our capitol city a sanctuary city. As we know, President Trump's executive order says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly list of these municipalities and pledges to withdraw federal grant money from them. What I'm wondering is, is how soon we can expect to see this list and how soon should cities like Providence expect to see their federal funding cut?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Kim. I think the president's goal in ending sanctuary cities is pretty clear. We want to, as we mentioned with these other actions, keep America safe. The goal is to make sure on two fronts. One, we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens, institutions, and ending sanctuary cities is one of the ways in which we can continue to do that. Furthermore, the president's been very clear through his executive order that federal funds paid for by hardworking taxpayers should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities.\n\n\"As we continue to implement this executive order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we'll have further updates on how we intend — how that list will come out and when it will come out so I look forward to following up on that as well.\"\n\nNATALIE HERBICK, WJW, Cleveland (Feb. 1): \"Secretary Spicer, thank you so much for this rare opportunity. I appreciate it. I'm learning the ropes here. I'd like to quickly ask two questions, if I may. The first one being, President Trump has been quick to take action on several issues he's addressed along the campaign trail, and with that in mind, he made a stop here in Cleveland, and he said that he would like to make cities like ours the economic envy of the world, a bold statement. So our viewers would love to know an example, a specific example as to how he plans to do this sooner than later.\n\nSPICER: \"That's a great question, Natalie. I think it's not just Cleveland, but it's Detroit and so many of the other cities around the country. You've heard the president talk about the need to rebuild our inner cities. We were really impressed with Cleveland this past July. We went there for the national convention -- the people of Cleveland, their desire, and the rebound that the city has taken. And I think that when you go to, whether it's a city like Cleveland, or Detroit, through different tax and regulatory measures, there's a way that we can continue to bring manufacturing back; we can continue to bring jobs back.\n\n\"And whether it's, you know, Harley Davidson, or Carrier, or Lockheed, or Boeing, or the GM, Fiat, Ford. These companies, he continues to talk with about how they can bring jobs back, relocate. That was, again, another one of the conversations that he had with the pharmaceutical companies yesterday. How can they bring jobs back? How can we ease regulations to do that?\n\n\"So it's about making sure that we have an environment, Natalie, that allows more cities to compete, to grow the manufacturing base, and to recognize the things that we can do, tax-wise and regulatory-wise, to allow that to flourish.\"\n\nLARS LARSON, Lars Larson Show, Portland, Ore. (Feb. 1): \"Commander Spicer, it's a pleasure. Thanks for your service to America, and thanks for the opportunity. I've got a broad question. The federal government is the biggest landlord in America. It owns two-thirds of a billion acres of America. I don’t think the founders ever envisioned it that way. Does President Trump want to start returning the people's land to the people? And in the meantime, for a second question — since that's in fashion these days — can he tell the Forest Service to start logging our forests aggressively again to provide jobs for Americans, wealth for the Treasury, and not spend $3.5 billion a year fighting forest fires?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Lars. I think the president has been very clear that as part of an overall comprehensive energy solution, that we've got to utilize the resources that we have, that the federal government owns, whether that's the forests or natural resources or minerals that exist above and below the ground, that we have too infrequently looked at our own resources and counted too much on foreign sources of energy.\n\n\"So we're going to continue, as Congressman Zinke goes through the process to head up the Interior Department, and Governor Perry goes through his appointment — his confirmation process, to get those individuals through, but then working together in areas where they have overlap and also on areas where they will act individually to realize, to look at those natural resources that we have and figure out how to best utilize them to benefit not just our energy, but also economic growth opportunities with that.\"\n\nJEFF JOBE, Jobe Publishing, Glasgow, Ky. (Feb. 1): \"Thank you for allowing me to be part of today's White House press briefing. Clearly, anyone paying attention will see that President Trump is aggressively acting on his campaign promises. This in itself gives hope to my state and particularly the region in which I grew up, Appalachia. We've seen countless politicians make promises at both state and national levels, and not only forget us, but to turn on us. So my question is, how soon or when will the roles restricting coal mining, coal burning and coal exports be reversed?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Jeff. I've talked about this a couple times so far, but I believe — or the president has very clearly stated that clean coal in particular is an issue that's so important to our energy independence as well as our job creation in this country. And so whether you're talking about Kentucky or West Virginia or Pennsylvania, or so many other places in this country that rely on coal, bringing the production of clean coal back is good for our energy independence, is good for our economy, is good for job creation, and is something that he continues to talk about. And I think once we have the Secretary of Energy confirmed, that we can continue to take steps to move forward with.\"\n\nJACKIE NESPRAL, WTVJ, Miami (Feb. 3): \"Good afternoon. On behalf of the viewers of South Florida, thanks so much for this opportunity. You know, a lot of focus on foreign affairs this week, a new sanctions announced today against Iran, and of course Miami, as you know, is home to the largest Cuban-American community in the country. And during the campaign, President Trump talked about his discontent with the warming of U.S.-Cuba relations implemented by President Obama. And in the last days of his administration, he ended the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy, leaving thousands of Cubans in limbo.\n\n\"So my question is twofold. A, has there been any contact between your administration and the Cuban government? And B, are there any plans to change the current policy right now?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Jackie. We are in the midst of a full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba. The president is committed to an agenda of ensuring human rights for all citizens throughout the world. And as we review those policies in Cuba, that will be forefront in their policy discussions, but there is nothing that we have on that front at this point.\"\n\nJOSH McELVEEN, WMUR, Manchester, N.H. (Feb. 3): \"Hey, Sean, thanks for taking the question. I know you're looking forward to the Patriots coming down in a couple of months — a lot of people up here are hoping that happens as well. Getting to business, though, for more than two years, the number-one public health and safety threat facing this state is the heroin and opioid crisis. During the campaign, the president promised to be swift and aggressive when it came to this problem — stopping the flow of drugs coming across the border. Increasingly, though, the problem lies in synthetic fentanyl being cooked up in labs in the northeast. What is the administration doing on that front as well as the treatment aspect of addiction?\n\n\"And secondly, if I may, with the understanding it is a state issue, New Hampshire is poised to become a 'right to work' state, but the vote is expected to be close. Given the administration's favorable view of 'right to work,' is it actively engaged in that effort? And if not, what is the general message from the White House?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Josh. First, on the opioid crisis, that is a major problem for not just New Hampshire but for so many states across the country. I think one of the things beyond the health issue is to make sure that we're looking at borders use. And the flow of heroin through our southern border is something that the president obviously takes — that's part of his whole strong immigration stance, strong border security, having that wall built, having additional assets on the southern border will go a long way to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country from our southern border up through the states.\"\n\n\"It was obviously, as you mentioned, a big issue that he made in New Hampshire throughout the primary and continued so on the campaign. And that's something that as soon as Tom Price and others are confirmed throughout the department, this has got a health component to it, it's got a border issue to it. So there is a multi-government approach that needs to be taken to the opioid crisis.\n\n\"With respect to right to work, I think you accurately portrayed it. The president believes in right to work. He wants to give workers and companies the flexibility to do what's in the best interest for job creators. Obviously, the vice president has been a champion of this as well. It's something that is a big deal in Indiana and something that he has championed as well.\"\n\nCHRISTOPHER SIGN, KNXV in Phoenix (Feb.3): \"Sean, thank you for doing this. Hello from a sunny and beautiful Phoenix. With the likely confirmation on the horizon with a new Veteran Affairs secretary, there has been discussion regarding privatizing the VA. There's also still concerns regarding wait times, even overall care and some reports regarding a suicide rate. What is the reform that the administration is seeking here? Also, will the administration protect whistleblowers?\n\n\"Second part of the question: We've seen protests here in Phoenix, as in the nationwide as well. When you talk about unity, what is the administration doing to bring more unity to the nation, and even more transparency? As here in Phoenix, we saw that secret meeting on the tarmac. How is the administration repairing all of this?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Chris. First, I mean, I think the president, mostly through deed, continues to show that he wants to bring people together in this country, figure out how to move the country forward, both economically, job-wise. I think that is something that he continues to show a desire for. He talked about it in his inaugural address and the prayer breakfast.\n\n\"So I think he's going to continue to show through both word and deed his desire to move the country forward. I'm trying to think. Can you go back to the first part?\"\n\nQ: \"That's all right. The confirmation — the likely confirmation of the VA secretary.\"\n\nSPICER: \"Oh yeah, Dr. Shulkin. Yeah, look, I think first and foremost on VA reform, the number one thing is to get Dr. Shulkin confirmed. And so many of these, as I brought up in the past couple days, it's hard to talk about how we're going to enact an agenda of reform when Senate Democrats continue to slow-walk some of these folks. And I think that's a big problem. Dr. Shulkin is the right individual to reform the VA — to understand whether it's lending or medical care, the problems and the challenges that we face at the VA. These are people who have served our nation and deserve the best care they can get, whether that's the mortgage lending, health care, or the variety of other stuff that the VA serves or provides to our veterans. And I think that what the president has done is talk to people like Dr. Toby Cosgrove at Cleveland Clinic and other business leaders about providing a better approach to serving the needs of our veterans.\n\n\"Right now, you're right, there are still wait times that are unacceptable. There's care that's unacceptable. We've got to address that, and he's going to continue to do it.\"\n\nDALE JACKSON WVNN-AM, Trinity, Ala. (Feb. 3): \"Sean, thank you very much for taking questions from outside the elite media bubble there in D.C. My question is about immigration. Donald Trump made this the forefront of his campaign, the foundation of it, yet the DACA and DAPA programs still exist. And I learned from a member of Congress yesterday that the Trump administration is still issuing the work permits that (inaudible) individuals.\n\n\"Question one is, when are these programs going to be ended? And question two, when will they stop issuing work permits to these individuals?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Dale. I think as you know, Secretary Kelly just assumed office. We are reviewing these programs. We've made it very clear that we'll have further updates on immigration referring to DACA and DAPA. The president has made significant progress on addressing the pledge that he made to the American people regarding immigration problems that we face, and I think we're going to see more action on that in the next few weeks.\"\n\nCOURTIS FULLER, WLWT-TV, Cincinnati (Feb. 8): \"Good afternoon, Cincinnati, among other cities has recently voted to become a sanctuary city, (inaudible), vowing not to enforce federal immigration laws without a specific request. They also say they want to be open and welcoming to refugees. My question today, how will President Trump respond? Will Cincinnati face economic or other sanctions including, for example, funding of the Brent Spence Bridge which he said he would fund when he was on the campaign trail?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Courtis. As I have noted before, the end of the day, this order is about two things. One, keeping our cities safe, and two, respecting the hard-earned taxpayers who send their money to the federal government. And the president is going to do everything he can within the scope of the executive order to make sure that the cities you don't comply with it, counties another institutions, that the remains into a cities, they will not get federal government funding in compliance with the executive order. I think more — more areas like Miami-Dade down in Florida, understand the importance of this order, and we hope cities like Cincinnati and others community around the country follow their lead and comply with that.\"\n\nNORMA GARCIA, KXTX-TV, Dallas, Tex. (Feb. 8): \"Thank you. In (inaudible) to penalize sanctuary cities. In this state and other states around the country, there is a growing concern among undocumented immigrants whose lives are deeply rooted in the United States and have no criminal records.\n\n\"My question is: Is this administration ready to tackle comprehensive immigration reform? If so, can you give us a timeline for it? If not, what is the plan to deal with undocumented immigrants who live in this country long term?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Norma. I think, you know, this has come up several times. I don't think that anybody doubts the president's concern or priority that is placed on immigration. He's talked about it on — you know, when you talk about a comprehensive approach, he's talked about building a wall. He's talked about making sure we go after criminals in this country. He's talked about walking through the process and addressing DACA and DAPA in time.\n\n\"I think this is a big problem. This is — there's no question that both on the security side and on reforming the current immigration system that is so clearly broken, that he is walking through this already both in terms of executive action, and then will continue to work through Congress.\n\n\"So to your question about the timeline, I think he's already enacting several pieces of it and he's going to work with Congress to get further down that.\"\n\nJOSH SMITH, WJHL-TV, Johnson City, Tenn. (Feb. 8): \"First off, thanks so much for taking questions from journalists covering local news. We appreciate it.\n\n\"WJHL is in northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. That is coal country. And I have two questions related to coal.\n\n\"Then candidate Trump came to Abingdon, Va. last year. And he made a bold promise. If it helped to rescue the mining industry, that he would help to bring back coal jobs. And he would push back against coal environmental regulations.\n\n\"If the executive order last week was a first step, what specifically is the president willing to do, planning to do to make good on that promise to help the coal industry? To encourage coal production and use, and to deal with what some call its demonized image?\n\n\"And as a follow-up I got to ask two questions because when am I ever going to get to do this again?\n\n\"What assurances can the president give those who hear him talking about and pushing back against environmental regulations and bringing back coal? What assurances can he give those who are very worried about the impact on the environment?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Well, I think that there's this — I mean I think when you hear him talk about coal specifically, it's under the guise of clean coal. And I think the technology we're able to utilize these days make it one of the cleanest uses of technology that we have. And the president's point is that as we bring back this industry we can do it in a way that is environmentally friendly, and it becomes a great and greater energy source for us.\n\n\"Just the other day the Department of Energy noted that we expect I think it's about a 3% increase in coal production in this country, which is a noticeable reverse of where it's been in the past.\n\n\"You mentioned the executive order and the talk that the president's had over the past year or so about his desire to bring back coal. Largely that has to do with regulation that the EPA has put on existing coal plants that have ensured that they couldn't operate in an effective way to stay open.\n\n\"I think the president's working with industry to roll back a lot of that, and do it in a way that's environmental friendly. And I think that you can do that utilizing the technology you have and harness the power of clean coal, Josh. Thanks.\"\n\nADRIANA COHEN, Boston Herald (Feb. 8): \"Great to be with you, Sean. Last night, Boston Mayor Walsh went on a television show to talk about sanctuary cities. What does the president make of his vow to house illegal immigrants in Boston city hall to shield them from the Trump administration?\"\n\nSPICER: \"I think the president's executive order is pretty clear when it comes to these kind of actions. Again, I think — I referenced it earlier in the briefing — but it's two-fold. One is there's a concern about the safety of the American people on how we let people come into this country. And second, with respect to the American taxpayer.\n\n\"And if we're going to be sending federal tax dollars to folks, to Washington, I think they need to be used appropriately. And the president's going to do everything in his power to respect the money that taxpayers send to — send to Washington and is spent facilitating legal activities and on American citizens.\"\n\nJOHN HUCK, KVVU-TV, Las Vegas (Feb. 14): \"Thank you so much on behalf of our viewers here in Southern Nevada for the opportunity to join you today. As you know, Sean, Las Vegas has suffered terribly in the last recession — more so than perhaps any other city in the country. As the administration moves forward with repealing financial regulations and possibly rolling back Dodd-Frank, what guarantees can you make to Nevadans that those actions won't lead banks and investments banks to re-engage with the risky financial behaviors that tanked our economy the last time and left taxpayers here on the hook to bail those banks out?\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, John. I think one of the things — if you look at the intent of Dodd-Frank, it was to make sure that we didn't have institutions that were too big to fail. And frankly, it has actually created institutions that are now too big to fail. Dodd-Frank actually did exactly the opposite of what it intended to do. And I think when you look at the regulation HJR 41 that the president is signing today, this is another example of the president taking decisive action to roll back regulations that are, frankly, creating more of a burden on our nation's banks and businesses than helping them.\n\n\"I think the president is going to be very clear with making sure that we do things that build up the goal of what Dodd-Frank actually intended to do. But right now, we actually, through Dodd-Frank, put taxpayers more on the hook than we let them off. We've created more institutions and created more guarantees for the federal government to bail out some of these institutions if they exceed their authority.\"\n\nJASON STEVENS, Federalist Papers Project, Ashland, Ohio (Feb. 14): \"Thank you. What our readers at the Federalist Papers Project are most interested in is returning the country to the first principles of republican government as understood by the American Founders. One of those principles, in the Declaration of Independence, is the consent of the governed. So my question is this: What are the president’s future plans for rolling back the expensive and burdensome regulations of the administrative state, most of which are the product of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who never received the consent of the governed to do anything, let alone make law?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Jason. I think, as I mentioned today, the president, in just a few minutes, is going to be signing HJR 41, which is one of those attempts to roll back some onerous Dodd-Frank regulations with respect to the SEC in particular.\n\n\"He is going to continue — last week we rolled out another one of those executive orders that ensures that for every new regulation, two must be gotten rid of. The president’s commitment to rolling back regulation and the overreach of government, I think, is unwavering and unquestionable. So you’re going to continue to see this president undo a lot of that government overreach.\"\n\nJOYCE KAUFMAN, WFTL-AM, Palm Beach, Fla. (Feb. 14): \"Thank you so much for this opportunity. I’m approximately six miles away from Mar-a-Lago right now, and the president met with Prime Minister Abe from Japan at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. And besides giving us traffic and security nightmares, there were apparently conversations that took place by telephone and with the Prime Minister that were in a relatively insecure dining area. There is already video of this surfacing. Will there be a SCIF put in place in these dining areas, these public places? And one last question. When he meets with Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow, will they be discussing moving the embassy, and settlements?\"\n\nSPICER: \"On the second one, I’m not going to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s discussion with the president. We’ll have a readout. After that, there will be a press conference.\n\n\"With respect to the first, there is a SCIF at Mar-a-Lago. And just to be clear, the briefing — the president was briefed in a SCIF ahead of dinner. He went with his national security team. They briefed him on the situation in North Korea. Subsequently, he had a dinner, of which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members. At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about what may or may not be discussed. There was simply a discussion about press logistics, where to host the event. And then after the dinner, the president went back into the SCIF to get a further update from his team.\n\n\"So I’m not really sure where people jumped to conclusions. There is a SCIF there. It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the president by his national security team the situation in North Korea. And then the president subsequently stood shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese president to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware.\"\n\nNEIL VIGDOR, Hearst Connecticut Media Group, Bridgeport, Conn. (Feb. 23): \"Good afternoon, Sean. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Connecticut’s governor directed police chiefs across the state Wednesday to avoid taking any special action against undocumented immigrants, including honoring immigration detainer requests from ICE. What will the repercussions be for this state in terms of federal funding it receives from the Trump administration?\n\n\"And secondly, does the president’s executive order on sanctuary cities apply to those that are undeclared sanctuary cities?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Well, Neil, I think there’s a couple things. The idea that Governor Malloy would not want the law followed as enacted by Congress or by the Connecticut legislature in any fashion seems to be concerning, right? Whether you’re a governor or mayor or the president, laws are passed in this country and we expect people and our lawmakers and our law enforcement agencies to follow and adhere to the laws as passed by the appropriate level of government.\n\n\"So it’s obviously concerning, I think, and it’s troubling that that’s the message that he would send to his people and to other governors. Because we are a nation of laws, and I think that people need to understand that whether it’s the laws that he passes as the governor of Connecticut or the laws that are passed through Congress and signed by the president, there’s a reason that our democracy works. It’s because the people speak, our representatives at every level pass a law, and the executive in that particular branch of government signs or vetoes it, and then we live by those rules. And the idea that you can decide which laws to agree or not to agree with, or follow or not follow, undermines our entire rule of law.\n\n\"And so I would suggest that that is not a great sign to be sending to the people of Connecticut and the people of this country, that a particular governor chooses not to follow the duly-passed laws of this nation.\n\n\"With respect to sanctuary cities, I think this is an area that the American people by huge amounts support. They recognize their tax dollars shouldn’t be spent supporting programs and activities to which people are not entitled to. And so I think the president has been very clear on this — that if you are a sanctuary city, declared or undeclared, if you are providing benefits or services, we are going to do everything we can to respect taxpayers and ensure that your states follow the law.\"\n\nROBY BROCK, Talk Business & Politics, Little Rock, Arkansas (Feb. 23): \"Thanks, Sean. Roby Brock with Talk Business & Politics here in Arkansas, the home of the rowdiest town halls in the nation.\n\n\"I have a question on medical marijuana. Our state voters passed a medical marijuana amendment in November. Now we're in conflict with federal law, as many other states are. The Obama administration kind of chose not to strictly enforce those federal marijuana laws. My question to you is: With Jeff Sessions over at the Department of Justice as AG, what’s going to be the Trump administration’s position on marijuana legalization where it’s in a state-federal conflict like this?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Roby. There’s two distinct issues here: medical marijuana and recreational marijuana.\n\n\"I think medical marijuana, I’ve said before that the president understands the pain and suffering that many people go through who are facing especially terminal diseases and the comfort that some of these drugs, including medical marijuana, can bring to them. And that's one that Congress, through a rider in 2011 — looking for a little help — I think put in an appropriations bill saying the Department of Justice wouldn’t be funded to go after those folks.\n\n\"There is a big difference between that and recreational marijuana. And I think that when you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing that we should be doing is encouraging people. There is still a federal law that we need to abide by in terms of the medical — when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature.\n\n\"So I think there’s a big difference between medical marijuana, which states have a — the states where it’s allowed, in accordance with the appropriations rider, have set forth a process to administer and regulate that usage, versus recreational marijuana. That’s a very, very different subject.\"\n\nLAUREL STAPLES, KECI-TV, Missoula, Montana (Feb. 23): \"Montana has hundreds of miles of border with Canada. And according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, almost 1 million people come across that border into Montana each year. What are the administration’s plans to increase security on the Canadian border? And does the administration have any plans to build a wall there?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Well, we're obviously concerned — thank you — at all sorts of immigration in this country, whether it’s from our northern border or our southern border. I think the president understands that our southern border is where we have more of a concern in terms of the number of people and the type of activity that's coming over there in terms of the cartels and drug activity. But that doesn't mean that we're not paying attention to our northern border, as well. And we will continue to both monitor and take steps necessary at our northern border to ensure the safety of all Americans.\"\n\nSTEVE GRUBER, WJIM-AM, Lansing, Mich. (Feb. 23): \"Thank you, Sean. I greatly appreciate it. I’d like to talk to you more about tax policy, if I may. President Trump, of course, on the campaign trail talked a lot about tax policy and tax reform. That hasn’t happened yet, as we know. But I want to talk about something different. That's the border adjustability tax. With the manufacturers that were at the White House again today, states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, others have a great concern about this tax, and there seems to be a disconnect between some of the CEOs, some of the Republicans on Capitol Hill and the president as to whether or not this is appropriate.\n\n\"And I guess the question is: Could this tax have a chilling effect on manufacturing at a time when places like Ohio, and Michigan, and the Upper Midwest are trying to jumpstart the economy with manufacturing jobs? I wish for you to clarify, if you could, the president’s position.\"\n\nSPICER: \"Yes, Steve, thank you. I think the president has been very clear from the beginning that there is no tax if companies manufacture in the United States. We are one of only a handful of countries that doesn't tax the imports that come into our country. Almost every other country operates their tax code under that system.\n\n\"And so what happens is we have a system by which companies abroad can send their products — tax our products going into their country and institute an import tax, and then their products come into the United States with no import tax — which, frankly, gives a disincentive to companies to stay in the United States, to manufacture in the United States, to hire in the United States. And it tilts the field against the American worker.\n\n\"And so the president is looking at tax policy that encourages manufacturing and job creation in the United States. And if you think about it ...\"\n\nQ: \"So where is he on this border adjustability tax?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Hold on.\"\n\nQ: \"Where is he on this tax specifically?\"\n\nSPICER: \"I understand that. And I think that what he is doing is he met yesterday with his team on the budget. He’s talked to Secretary Mnuchin and others who are working on a comprehensive tax reform plan. And remember, Steve, this isn’t something that's been done since 1986. And so as we look at it, part of that is to make sure that we lower our corporate tax rate, that we make it more attractive to manufacture and grow jobs in the United States, to make our companies more competitive with companies overseas that, frankly, have better tax treatment than our own companies who stay in the United States. So creating more of a playing field that encourages manufacturing and growing and creating in the United States.\n\n\"But make no mistake, if a company is in the United States already and expanding in the United States, it will be only to their benefit. Actually, if you think about it right now, the way the current tax code works, it almost incentivizes companies from leaving the United States, manufacturing, and expanding overseas, and then sending their goods and services back to the United States, which undermines our own economy, it undermines our workers.\"\n\nQ: \"But the question is about components coming back in the United States being manufactured.\"\n\nSPICER: \"I understand, Steve. O.K., I know that you're on the Skype, but we only do like one or two follow-ups.\n\n\"But the answer is, is that he’s working towards comprehensive tax reform, and we’ll have a plan out within the next few weeks that will address that.\"\n\nMICHAEL MEDVED, Michael Medved Show, Fremont, Calif. (March 7): \"Yes, hello. Sean, thank you very much. Obviously, today there was a big emphasis on Obamacare, which is profoundly important to the American people. But it seems that too often in the last several weeks, the administration has gotten distracted and media have gotten distracted by talk of wiretapping at Trump Tower, or the president calling his predecessor a 'bad' and 'sick guy' or criticizing the ratings of 'Celebrity Apprentice.' Do you think the White House could do a better job of focusing on the issues that really matter, the reforms that matter to the American people rather than getting distracted to these subsidiary conflicts as we move forward into the coming months?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Michael. Respectfully, I would say that we have been focused. We're here talking about Obamacare and the need to drive down the cost and access for healthcare for every American. I think that's a pretty significant thing to be focused on.\n\n\"Yesterday, we were talking about the president’s effort to continue to keep the nation safe, to make sure that people aren’t coming into the country who aren’t here for peaceful purposes. The president has talked to almost 50 world leaders. He’s had 30-plus executive actions on all sorts of stuff from regulatory aspects to things that will create more jobs. I think that's a fairly focused effort.\n\n\"That being said, I think, look, whether it was Candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, or now President Trump, the president has always made it very clear — or not he made it clear, but I think the voters made it clear that one of the things that they appreciate about him is his ability to be authentic and to speak very forcefully and very directly with the American people. And that's an aspect that I think was central to why he was elected, is because he’s not a canned politician that's going to give the same staid answers over and over again.\"\n\nBRYAN CRABTREE, WAFS, Atlanta, Georgia (March 16): \"Thank you, Sean, for taking questions from a talk-radio host right here in Georgia and not in the D.C. swamp. First, I have two questions. First, to the president’s tax returns and classified information. President Trump campaigned on draining the swamp. The American people then want to know why he (inaudible). And Commissioner Koskinen has not yet been fired by the Trump administration. My second question is with regard to there are — many conservatives are really concerned that Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, is leading President Trump down a very wrong path on healthcare. How do you react to that?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Well, on the first one, there's no personnel updates with respect to — with the exception of the ones that I mentioned today.\n\n\"On the second, Donald Trump is not one to be led down a path by anyone. I think he is — he talked today at the lunch with the Taoiseach and Speaker Ryan that he’s working hand-in-glove with the Speaker. He talked about it last night. This is a commitment that he has to enacting healthcare. This is a process that he is committed to, wants to see through because of a goal that he wants to achieve, which is making a more patient-centric healthcare system that lowers the cost and increases the options.\n\n\"But he doesn’t get led down any path. He leads very clearly. And I think if you listen to Speaker Ryan today, he’s in agreement that there’s been a strong partnership between the House, the administration and I think the Senate so far to make sure that we get this bill done. And that's what our goal is going to be, and that's — so I would argue that we've actually done a pretty good job of getting that done.\n\nJOHN DePETRO, WADK-AM, Newport, R.I. (March 22): \"Yes. Good afternoon, Sean, from WADK in Newport. Sean, you have a lot of members of the media saying that President Trump -- the president to all the people. What does the president say about nonstop partisanship? Yesterday, you had Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse grandstanding at the confirmation hearing. We've had Elizabeth Warren before there even was a hearing, (inaudible) the Boston Globe condemning the nomination. You had Rhode Island Governor, Gina Raimondo, boycott the nomination while she while she fundraised around the country. What's the president saying to frustrated Trump supporters who don’t feel they're getting proper representation at the local level and in Congress?\"\n\nMR. SPICER: \"Well, I mean, I think with respect to Judge Gorsuch, which is I think -- pretty clear that's where you're headed on this ...\"\n\nQ: \"Yes.\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thank you. I just — I mean, when you look at the praise, I mean, obviously I would love for it to be universal. And while we've gotten bipartisan praise from pundits and former law clerks in both parties, high number of jurists and former people — legal scholars, members of Congress, we're not going to win everybody. And I think that Democrats have tried to score some points on the committee. They've largely fallen by the wayside. And we've seen very high praise for him.\n\n\"So I would just suggest that anybody who's got a problem with him, I'd love to hear it, because so far most of the issues — no one seems to have a problem with his academic credentials, his record or anything else. So I'm pretty buoyed by a lot of what we've seen come out of Capitol Hill with respect to him.\"\n\nELIZABETH CRISP, Baton Rouge, Louisiana (March 22): \"Hi, Sean, thanks. Last year, Louisiana suffered one of the worst flooding disasters in our nation’s history. Today, thousands of people remain displaced, and communities are struggling to rebuild. With support from the Obama administration, the state received about $1.6 billion in flood assistance through the CDBG program. The state is seeking $2 billion more in federal aid, and our governor has asked for President Trump’s support.\n\n\"So my question is twofold. What is the Trump administration’s position exactly on the federal government’s role in long-term disaster recovery efforts? And also, can Louisiana count on this administration’s support for additional flood recovery assistance?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Elizabeth. I believe the process works such that the governor makes a request to FEMA; FEMA then puts it through the process. I’m not aware of what the request is or where it stands in the process, and I would refer you back to FEMA on that.\"\n\nQ: \"This is actually — this is aid separate from FEMA. It’s the long-term part to this.\"\n\nSPICER: \"Okay. So I know that the budget that was just presented allows for substantial funding for humanitarian assistance, including disaster refugee program funding in priority areas. I think at this point the budget process has just kicked off, and we will now begin the process of working with Congress on — them draft a budget, and talk about our priorities and where they go forward.\"\n\n\"The president will have a full budget out in May, and so that will be an appropriate time to do that. But I would refer you back to the governor at this point, and figure out where that stands in the process.\"\n\nRANDALL JEFFERSON, WWDB, Philadelphia (March 31): \"The question is: President Trump signed an executive order that he intends to not fund cities that refuse to share immigration status information. Attorney General Sessions recently suggested that cities could not only lose future funds but that the federal government may require them to pay back grants. Will there be a — when and will — when will this take place? And will that money be reallocated to other departments like the Department of Education or HBCUs?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Well, I’m not — I would say that the president finds it unacceptable that some localities and counties and potentially some states have prioritized a political agenda over the safety of their people by flouting our nation’s immigration laws, becoming so-called sanctuary cities.\n\n\"The failure to follow federal law can have tragic consequences for all of our citizens and all of our country. It’s particularly concerning in a place like Chicago and other cities like yours in Philadelphia where there’s been increased violence. Immigrants both legal and illegal are not safe from criminals who have committed egregious acts are free to roam the streets.\n\n\"And the attorney general has issued a public notice reminding all states and local jurisdictions of their responsibilities to comply with federal laws.\n\n\"With respect to the budget piece, I think we've had an ongoing budget process, and we’ll have to see how many states comply and where, if any, potential savings are there and then how we allocate them. But I think the president’s budget -- both his FY17 contingency budget for funding beyond this continuing resolution on April 28th, and then his FY18 budget that he’s already submitted — are going to reflect some key priorities both in terms of homeland security and national defense.\n\n\"So we’ll see where we would reallocate any of that money, but I think the priority is clear is to get cities into compliance and to make sure that we understand there’s not just a financial impact to this but also a very clear security aspect of this.\"\n\nDERRICK BLAKLEY, WBBM, Chicago (March 31): \"Thank you. I have a question, and if at all possible, a follow-up as well. Chicago gets about $12 million a year in law enforcement assistance from the federal government. Would President Trump cut off those funds due to the sanctuary city status even though it would greatly hamper the police fight against street violence, something the president has repeatedly said troubles him greatly?\"\n\nSPICER: \"I think that you — it's interesting, you talk about street violence and then we cut off the funding for sanctuary cities. I think it would be interesting to want to send more money to a city that is allowing people to come into the country who are breaking the law, who, in many cases, are committing crimes — member of gangs. And so you can't be a sanctuary city and at the same time seem to pretend or express concern about law enforcement or ask for more money when probably a number of the funds that you're using in the first place are going to law enforcement to handle the situation that you’ve created for yourself.\n\n\"I think the president’s belief on sanctuary cities is one shared by upwards of 80 percent of the American people that we shouldn’t be using American tax dollars to fund cities and counties and, in some cases, potentially states that are seeking to allow people who are not legally in this country, who potentially can do us harm, to get funding.\n\n\"And so I think there’s no question — it's not a question of what he will do. His intentions have been very clear from the beginning. I think it's vastly supported by the vast majority of the American people. But I think that to suggest that somehow they’re not inextricably linked is a failure to fully appreciate the scenario.\n\nQ: \"Can I follow up? Does that mean the president is more interested in deporting illegal immigrants than he is with putting shooters and killers in jail?\"\n\nSPICER: \"No. Because if a shooter or killer is here illegally and he’s in this country, then I think that — again, I think, respectfully, you're de-linking the two issues. If you have people who are in this country illegally that are part of a gang, that are part of -- they’re committing — a threat to public safety or committing a crime, then funding that activity and allowing that to fester is in itself a problem. And so by not rooting that out in the first place is allowing the problem to continue and not exactly showing an attempt to solve it in the first place.\"\n\nRICHARD ELLIOT, WSB-TV, Atlanta, Ga. (April 13): \"Obviously, our concern is the reconstruction of 85. We understand that the president is meeting with the first responders this afternoon — in just a few minutes, actually. We wanted to ask about the federal commitment to getting I-85 rebuilt as far as federal dollars and easing some federal regulations to get the job done quickly.\"\n\nSPICER: \"So a couple things on that front. Immediately following the tragedy that ensued in Atlanta, the president directed the Federal Highway Administration to release $10 million, and then we have begun to work with the appropriate agencies to expedite that process.\n\n\"I know that there are critical repairs that have to get made, and I think that -- not only that the initial funding will help with that for the roads and the bridges and the emergency access that needs to get handled. But under emergency relief efforts, there are ways to expedite some of that funding. And I would — the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration are probably the best way to get a better answer on that. But there are ways that some of that funding can be expedited beyond the initial commitment that the federal government has made.\"\n\nDAVID KINCHEN, WXTF-TV, Philadelphia (June 6): \"Sean, thank you so much for taking the time here. We really appreciate it here in Philadelphia and the Greater Delaware Valley.\n\n\"We do have a question about the president's budget proposal, specifically the proposal to eliminate the deductions for local and state taxes, property taxes. In New Jersey, folks reportedly pay the highest amount of property taxes in the nation. There was a Quinnipiac poll that said 57 percent of folks surveyed do not support the proposal to get rid of those deductions.\n\n\"So the question is, what do you say to the folks who are worried they may take a major hit?\"\n\nI'm going to get to our second guy here, Scott Hennen at KFYR in the Dakotas.\n\nSCOTT HENNEN, KFYR-AM, Bismark, N.D. (June 6): \"Hi, Sean. Good to talk with you. I host a radio show here in, as you mentioned, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, northern plains, and have the blessing of talking to listeners every day who are enormously frustrated right now with the way Washington works. Like the president they're not fond of the swamp.\n\n\"I'm curious if the infrastructure debate will be different. The president focusing on that. Our governor will be part of the governors and mayors that are coming on Thursday. Does — does he believe infrastructure is more than roads than bridges, like UAS and drones, autonomous vehicles, pipelines, broadband, flood protection, which is all creating jobs here right now?\n\n\"And will the infrastructure be better received there than the health care and tax -- tax reform debates have been so far? Might — might it be the — the chance you have to begin draining the swamp?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Well, thanks for the question. As you know, your governor will be here on Thursday, with a variety of other governors and mayors, to talk about infrastructure. And that'll be an opportunity for your governor to talk about the challenges that you guys face in — in the Dakotas.\n\n\"I know in North Dakota alone, there's several critical projects in both roads and bridges that need to get addressed, how the governor prioritizes them.\n\n\"But one of the issues that has been discussed with respect to the president's infrastructure plan is creating different pools of projects that allow for innovation, allow for prioritization. And so that will be something that, again, is in partnership with localities, with states to figure out what their priorities are, what they can do to help raise the necessary funds and really do this in a business-like, innovative way. So we've got a ways to go.\"\n\nSPICER: \"Well, David, thank you for asking. I think if you look at the principles outlined by Director Cohn and Secretary Mnuchin when they talked about the president's tax reform agenda, one of the principles was increasing the standard deduction. So for a middle-income family, you're talking about a doubling of that to $24,000.\n\nWe don't — we estimate that about 95% of the folks that file now would not take individual deductions because of the increase -- the large increase that would happen. Most middle- income Americans would actually save more under the president's plan because of the large increase that would exist with respect to the standard deduction.\"\n\nWILL CLARK, WHAS-AM, Louisville, Ky. (June 20): \"Sean, thanks for taking my question. My question is about the administration's position on coal. The administration had, during the campaign, said they wanted to bring back coal jobs to eastern Kentucky, and now there's a lot of those coal miners in that part of the state who are saying that they want tech jobs. They're going back to college to get the skills for those jobs. Does the administration still support the return of coal to those portions of eastern Kentucky and into West Virginia?\n\n\"And what is the president's relationship with Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin? I know he was at the White House last week and was also at the nominating convention in Cleveland, among other places.\"\n\nSPICER: \"He has been here a few times. I think they have a fantastic relationship. Governor Bevin has been a great advocate. He's done a lot in Kentucky to grow jobs and really fight for innovation down there. And I know that his ideas and his input have been very well received here at the White House, and we want to continue to work with him.\n\n\"I think with respect to your question, Will, it's not really a binary choice. I think the president wants to continue to, and has supported several measures, to really restore the coal industry and to bring it back.\n\n\"And to touch on the theme of this week, we want to do what we can to really focus on technology, helping our government bring back jobs, create new opportunities for our country, for jobs. We talked about this a couple weeks ago when we talked about workforce development -- or only a week ago, I guess. But part of it is to make sure that people have the training and the skills that they need, whether that's going to a vocational school or another training opportunity that gives them the skills in an area like high-tech and technology to pursue a new change in life or a new career or just at a high school.\n\n\"But we need to make sure that we have the training and the support, the loan system, etc., that will support people who want to go into a lot of these fields.\n\n\"So I don’t think it's a choice of one industry over another. Obviously, the president has and will continue to do a lot to support coal, especially the clean coal industry, and at the same time make sure that we have opportunities to give the workforce of the next century, or Americans the skillset to compete. And that's something that Secretary Acosta spoke from this podium on extensively last week.\"\n\nDAVE PRICE, WHO-TV, Des Moines, Iowa (June 20): \"Thanks, Sean. You already mentioned the president is coming. We understand that our longtime governor and now Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, will be there with him. The president has already praised Ambassador Branstad’s longtime relationship with China’s President Xi. As you know, the president has a certain style — the way he tweets and talks — and that doesn’t exactly mirror the way Terry Branstad has had his career. In light of that, how do you see this dynamic playing out in Ambassador Branstad’s role with China?\"\n\nSPICER: \"Thanks, Dave. Tomorrow, as you noted, the president will be joined by Governor Branstad at Kirkwood to not just discuss some of the agriculture aspects of what’s going to be discussed, but also talk about trade. I think he was clearly impressed with Governor Branstad — as Chuck Grassley put it, he’s been an ambassador for Iowa for decades, if not his whole life. And I think the president feels those skillsets, his understanding of China, and his dedication to help us support U.S. products and agricultural goods and other stuff, services, to China in particular is going to be a huge asset for the United States.\n\n\"He chose Governor Branstad because he was impressed with what he had done as ambassador — as governor in Iowa, and the respect that he has for the people of Iowa I think is going to serve this country well.\"\n\nCHRIS BERG, KVLY-TV, Fargo, N.D (June 29): \"Hey, Sarah. Thank you so much. I don't want to talk about any tweets. I want to talk about making America great again, and part of that energy dominance in Energy Week.\n\n\"Here’s the thing: During the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, we had some pretty scary times in North Dakota. Just a couple weeks ago, a judge made a decision suggesting that the Army Corps of Engineers had prematurely issued some permits. This creates more uncertainty for people. My question is this: What specifically is the administration going to do to give these companies more certainty, more clarity as they make these multi-billion-dollar infrastructure investments to improve our energy, and at the same point in time, ensure tribal leaders and tribal nations are feeling honored and respected about this entire permitting process.\n\nSANDERS: \"It was a little difficult to hear, but I believe the question was focused on energy production specific to Dakota Access, and I think we've been talking consistently about this. The president is dedicated to increasing energy production in the United States, and we're doing — part of the review of the Dakota Access Pipeline is the administration working with those tribal leaders and stakeholders throughout that process to make it as successful as possible.\n\n\"A lot of the tribal leaders also want to expand energy production and development in their area, and we're going to work continuously with them to try to make that as successful as possible.\"\n\nGreg Meriwether, WAFB-TV, Baton Rouge, La. (June 29): \"Sarah, our question is on health care. Specifically, our governor put out a number that perhaps hundreds of thousands of people in Louisiana will lose their health care if this bill goes through. If you add up the other states, that kind of puts it into the millions. Is there an acceptable number you're talking about behind the scenes of people losing coverage to get the greater bill through?\n\nSANDERS: \"Again, I’m having a little difficulty hearing. But as best I could understand, you're looking at how Obamacare repeal and replace would affect the state of Louisiana. And, I mean, frankly, Louisiana has been one of the hardest hit states in the country by Obamacare. Their insurance premiums have gone up over 125 percent. The goal here is to give people in the country choices. No one who currently has Medicaid will have their benefits cut. We're looking across the board the healthcare plans that will lower taxes, reduce premiums, and offer more choices for people in Louisiana and across the country. And hopefully that somewhat addressed your question as best I could.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/caucus/2020/01/26/assessments-other-democrats-president-register-editorial-board-endorsement/4562162002/", "title": "Iowa caucuses 2020: Register editorial board analyzes Democratic ...", "text": "The Register's editorial\n\nUpdated Jan. 25, 2020, 9:47 p.m. ET\n\nEditor’s note: Register endorsement editorials generally focus on the candidates the editorial board endorses, rather than those it does not.

Biden far outdistances the field in knowledge of foreign policy and familiarity with world leaders.\n\nHis 36 years in the Senate and his eight years of rounding up votes as vice president give him unrivaled experience in knowing how to get legislation passed through Congress.\n\nBiden can sometimes be gaffe-prone, but the board does not doubt that his heart is in the right place. He has endured the unfathomable losses of his first wife and two children. It has been moving to see him repeatedly take time on the campaign trail to share a quiet moment with others grieving the loss of loved ones.\n\nReservations: He lacks Warren’s specific expertise on income inequality issues. His ideas lean more toward incremental improvements on the Obama years than the bold agenda the times demand.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nThe former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a gifted speaker who demonstrates an impressive command of policy nuances and offers refreshing, common-ground approaches unburdened by the constraints of Washington insider politics.\n\nBefitting a one-time McKinsey consultant, he brings an analyst’s mind-set to breaking down issues, guided first by data and science rather than ideology.\n\nHe and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are the only two remaining candidates in either party who have served in the military, including war-time deployments. They offer a valuable boots-on-the-ground perspective on the cost of continuous war.\n\nReservations: His new-generation appeal is also his vulnerability. An eight-year tenure of heading a city the size of Davenport hardly seems adequate preparation for leading this vast, diverse, divided country. His relative lack of support among communities of color also raises questions about his ability to unite the country and suggests an area for personal growth.\n\nJohn Delaney\n\nThe former congressman from Maryland has worked hard to earn Iowans’ support. He’s met with Iowans at more than 250 events since announcing his candidacy in July 2017, about a third more than the next-closest rival, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nHis policy views generally align with the rest of the field. In his three terms in Congress, he compiled a record of pragmatism and bipartisanship.\n\nReservations: His inability to gain traction after such maximum effort shows the difficulty in breaking through the noise of a crowded field.\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nThe senior U.S. senator from Minnesota offers a distinguished record of service in important local and federal offices. She’s serving her 14th year in the Senate. Before that, she was county attorney for eight years in Hennepin County, home to Minneapolis and the most populous county in the state. That job exposed her up close to the ravages of gun violence and racial bias in the justice system.\n\nHer biggest appeal: She has a proven record of working across the aisle to get things done. Among senators who have served from 1993 to 2018, she ranks in the top third of the Lugar Center’s bipartisan index, which measures how frequently senators co-sponsor bills introduced by the opposite party or attract co-sponsors from the other party to bills they have introduced.\n\nReservations: It’s another case of strengths being potential risks. The board appreciates Klobuchar’s Midwest pragmatism and her recognition that passing legislation requires compromise. But do today’s urgent needs to bring our troops home and restore economic fairness call for bolder approaches?\n\nHelping you make your own decision\n\nVoter guide: Don’t have a lot of time?

Candidates on the issues: Find out how the 2020 presidential candidates plan to tackle healthcare, climate change, gun violence and more.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nThe Vermont senator shares Warren’s drive to improve prospects for working-class families. His two presidential campaigns have benefited the nation by focusing attention on an economy increasingly rigged to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the worker.\n\nReservations: While Elizabeth Warren and Sanders are in lockstep on many positions, concerns about Warren’s potential for divisiveness are magnified with Sanders. As a self-identified democratic socialist, someone who has set himself apart from the Democratic Party during his congressional career, let alone breaking bread with Republicans, could he build the consensus needed to govern?\n\nHe has routinely opposed trade agreements supported by Iowa’s farmers and manufacturers. His rhetoric is so anti-interventionist that one wonders whether he would recognize times when military action is justified as a deterrent.\n\nTom Steyer\n\nSteyer founded the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management in 1986 and amassed a fortune estimated at $1.6 billion before resigning in 2012. Since then, he has backed his beliefs with hundreds of millions of dollars, founding the nonprofit NextGen America, which fights climate change and registers voters, and Need to Impeach, a campaign to press for President Trump’s removal from office.\n\nNextGen America claims to have registered 1.3 million voters, and his donations to candidates in key U.S. House districts in 2018 are credited with helping Democrats flip control.\n\nHe clearly isn’t shy about spending his own money to catalyze change and has shown he can inspire and organize grassroots activism.\n\nReservations: Steyer says his business success best positions him to take on Trump regarding oversight of the economy. But Trump’s overall performance as CEO of the U.S. government begs the question: Is another billionaire businessman with no previous government experience the best choice? It also feels disquieting that while he calls for ending the stranglehold of money on politics, he has spent $100 million of his own money on his campaign so far, buying his way onto the debate stage by flooding the airwaves with ads.\n\nNews coverage: Breaking down the Register's endorsement\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nThe board is glad this prescient entrepreneur is in the race because of the attention he has brought to the promise and peril posed by the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nWhile technological transformation will create jobs unimagined now, it also threatens the jobs of millions of workers. Yang argues that automation will displace not just truck drivers and factory employees but also bookkeepers, retail and food service workers, call center employees and even doctors, accountants and lawyers.\n\nSure, some of his projections could prove overblown. But a key way today’s companies adapt to the rapidly shifting business landscape is to continuously hire then shed workers. It’s vital to help laid-off employees quickly retrain for new jobs at comparable wages. Yet after four decades of manufacturing decline and more than a decade of Internet disruption, America is still lousy at doing that.\n\nReservations: He lacks experience in government at any level. Some of his ideas, such as giving a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to every adult, are too radical to win public embrace.\n\nTwo voices that are missed\n\nThe editorial board was disappointed to see the campaigns of U.S. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California fold before voting begins.\n\nBoth are smart, accomplished public servants. Booker was mayor of Newark before his election to the Senate in 2013. Harris was the district attorney in San Francisco and served two terms as state attorney general before her election to the Senate in 2016.\n\nBooker worked across the aisle with U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa to secure passage of the First Step Act, significant criminal justice reform that was signed into law by President Trump in late 2018.\n\nBoth Booker and Harris can more than hold their own in dissecting policy pros and cons.\n\nBut they are also missed as authentic voices on matters such as mass incarceration, racially biased policing and persistent disparities between whites and people of color in academic achievement, wealth and quality of health care.\n\nIt’s difficult to draw a direct line between President Trump’s reckless rhetoric on race-related issues and an increase in racial tensions, but Gallup polling since 2001 generally shows heightened concerns in recent years about race relations.\n\nThe next president must recommit to the unfinished work of the American experiment: ensuring equal opportunity and equal justice under the law.\n\nNote: In its deliberations, the editorial board did not consider former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who are not focusing their campaigns on Iowa, or U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who has not campaigned in Iowa since October.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/05/iowa-legislature-adjourns-bills-passed-2018-session-water-quality-obamacare-abortion-mental-health/456079002/", "title": "Iowa 2018 Legislature adjourns: What bills passed in this session?", "text": "May 5, 2018 Updated May 7, 2018, 3:04 p.m. ET\n\nRepublicans promised Iowans Chapter Two of their pro-business, conservative agenda during the 2018 legislative session, and they delivered on some key issues on their checklist.\n\nThis session ended Saturday with the Senate adjourning at 5:11 p.m. and the House wrapping up at 5:25 p.m. The session, which began Jan. 8, lasted 118 days — 18 days longer than some lawmakers had hoped.\n\nThe final day included the House and Senate approving what majority Republicans described as the largest state tax relief and tax policy package in Iowa history. The plan will provide Iowa individuals and small business owners $398 million in state income tax cuts in 2019.\n\nHowever, lawmakers went home without passing a bill that would have gradually phased out $152 million in state payments made annually to cities, counties and school districts. Those payments were intended to offset the impacts of a sweeping cut in commercial property taxes approved five years ago. The bill was on the Senate debate calendar for Saturday, but it was dropped as local government officials warned it would lead to local budget cuts and property tax increases.\n\nThe Legislature also wrapped up work on a state general fund budget of nearly $7.5 billion for fiscal year 2019, which begins July 1, 2018. This included spending bills for health and human services programs and for standing state appropriations.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Chris Hagenow, R-Windsor Heights, said the 2018 session will be recalled for broad-based achievements in tax reform, health care, water quality and other areas while protecting education spending for K-12 schools.\n\n\"We have had an ambitious agenda and we had a lengthy list of things that we wanted to accomplish and we have been very successful,\" Hagenow said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said Republicans who control the Legislature have \"done a lot of bad things to good Iowans\" for the second consecutive year.\n\n\"They have made education and job training less affordable and less accessible for Iowans,\" Petersen said. \"Our health care system is still a mess, making it harder for Iowans to access health care, whether they are a senior, someone with a disability, and women.\"\n\nPetersen said she particularly takes issue with the Republicans' passage of a law that bans nearly all abortions in Iowa after about six weeks of pregnancy, and legislation that has \"gutted\" the state's family planning network.\n\nKey issues the Legislature addressed this year included approval of a major funding bill to improve Iowa's water quality, legislation to skirt Obamacare mandates in a bid to curb costs for Iowa health care plans, changes in the state's mental health system, and a utilities regulation bill that slashes $100 million in energy efficiency programs financed by utility customers with a goal of reducing the customers' bills.\n\nLast year was \"ChapterOne\" of the GOP agenda. In 2017, the Republican-controlled Capitol rolled back collective bargaining for public employees, expanded gun rights, limited lawsuits affecting livestock producers and medical malpractice cases, and nullified local minimum-wage increases in five counties.\n\n►More: What ideas did the 2018 Iowa Legislature leave to die?\n\nThis year's session will likely be remembered for one stunning development as much as for new policy: the abrupt resignation of former Senate Majority Leader Bill Dix, R-Shell Rock. He quit the Senate and headed home in March just hours after a video and photos were posted on an online political website that showed him kissing a female Statehouse lobbyist, who wasn't his wife, at a Des Moines tavern. Dix helped engineer the conservative agenda that became law last year.\n\nThis was the first legislative session with Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, as the state's chief executive. After seven sessions as lieutenant governor, she became the first woman to serve as Iowa's governor last May, when former Gov. Terry Branstad resigned to become U.S. ambassador to China.\n\n“Yes, we accomplished a lot. No, we’re not finished,\" she said after the final gavel fell. \"There’s still much work to be done before we can pass on to our children an Iowa that’s even better than the one we inherited.”\n\nBelow are some of the bills passed in the 2018 session. Reynolds has already signed many but others await gubernatorial action. Most take effect on July 1, but some took effect immediately or will take effect on other dates.\n\nBILLS SIGNED BY GOV. REYNOLDS\n\nHealth care\n\nFETAL HEARTBEAT: Republicans approved a bill banning most abortions in the state and giving Iowa the strictest abortion law in the nation. Senate File 359, which takes effect July 1, will prohibit nearly all abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. That can occur about six weeks into a pregnancy and often before a woman realizes she’s pregnant. Iowa law currently bans most abortions after 20 weeks, which already is among the strictest abortion bans in the country. Opponents of the legislation have promised a court battle, while supporters of the bill see a lawsuit as a potential test of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned state bans on abortion nationwide.\n\nALTERNATIVE HEALTH PLAN: Lawmakers approved controversial legislation to exempt certain health plans from Affordable Care Act mandates. Backers say the measure will reduce health insurance costs, but critics worry it could undermine consumer protections.\n\nSenate File 2349 gives small employers freedom to band together to buy health insurance for their workers through \"association health plans.\" It effectively allows insurance carriers to resume selling small-employer policies that don’t meet Affordable Care Act rules, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe bill was merged with another proposal that would allow the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to work with Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield to sell health insurance plans that don't comply with the federal Affordable Care Act to its members. The law says the plans are not health insurance and can't be regulated like health insurance.\n\nMENTAL HEALTH OVERHAUL: Sweeping legislation aimed at making comprehensive changes to Iowa's often-criticized mental health system was overwhelmingly approved. House File 2456 expanded mental health services, including the addition of six regional “access centers.” Those centers would help people who are having mental-health crises, but don’t need hospitalization. Proponents say the centers will be a humane, economical alternative to hospitalization and will free up scarce psychiatric hospital beds for patients in severe crisis. The legislation also adds “assertive community treatment” teams to help people with serious mental illness stay on medication and in treatment so they don’t spiral out of control and need hospitalization. It also makes changes to mental health commitment rules and encourages development of “subacute” treatment facilities, which could take patients who are ready to be released from hospitals but still need significant care.\n\nSUICIDE PREVENTION: Iowa school employees working with students will be required to have at least one hour annually of training in suicide prevention. Senate File 2113 requires the State Board of Education to adopt rules requiring school districts to adopt protocols for suicide prevention and intervention after a suicide, and for the identification of adverse childhood experiences to mitigate \"toxic stress response.\" The protocols must be based on nationally recognized best practices.\n\nJobs\n\nFUTURE READY IOWA: One of Gov. Reynolds' top priorities, known as \"Future Ready Iowa,\" won overwhelming approval. The goal of House File 2458 is to have 70 percent of Iowa workers obtain education or training beyond high school by the year 2025. That compares to 60 percent in 2014. The legislation establishes a registered apprenticeship development program, a volunteer mentoring program, a summer youth intern program, summer post-secondary courses for high school students that are aligned with high-demand career pathways, an employer innovation fund and skilled workforce scholarship and grant programs.\n\nEducation\n\nSCHOOL AID: House File 2230 increases basic state aid to Iowa's K-12 schools by 1 percent for the upcoming academic year. That represents about $32 million in additional state aid as part of a $3.2 billion school funding package for the 2018-2019 school year. The governor also signed Senate File 455, which provides about $14 million to address state and district costs per pupil and to help equalize transportation costs for school districts across the state.\n\nACTIVE SHOOTERS: Senate File 2364 requires Iowa school districts and accredited private schools to develop high-quality emergency operations plans for school buildings by June 30, 2019. This includes plans to address active-shooter scenarios and natural disasters, such as tornadoes and floods. The legislation requires annual drills.\n\nSTUDENT TESTING: Lawmakers approved legislation to award the University of Iowa a statewide student testing contract in a no-bid process. Critics contended that House File 2235 will encourage litigation, discourage educators from participating in professional task force initiatives and could cost the state of Iowa million of dollars in federal money.\n\nThe new law requires that all students in grades 3-11 take assessment tests in mathematics and English language arts, including reading and writing, during the last quarter of the school year. In addition, all students enrolled in school districts in fifth, eighth and 10th grades will be administered a state exam in science during the last quarter of the year.\n\nThe goal of the bill is to ensure Iowa students start taking an exam that reflects the state's learning expectations, according to Republican lawmakers. Lawmakers also said it would be easier to address developing issues if the state uses Iowa-based tests.\n\nLATE-YEAR BUDGET CUTS: Following weeks of negotiations, Iowa legislators agreed to cut state programs and services by about $35.5 million in an effort to balance the budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, with state universities shouldering the heaviest share. The Iowa Board of Regents was ordered to make $11 million in cuts for the current budget year ending June 30 under Senate File 2117, although those cuts cannot be made to the University of Northern Iowa.\n\nSCHOOL LUNCH SHAMING: Iowa students without money to pay for school lunches could no longer be publicly shamed or stigmatized under House File 2467. The move follows reports across Iowa and the nation that students without the money to pay for lunches were being publicly identified and made to feel embarrassed in front of their peers. Lawmakers from both parties said shaming makes it harder for students to focus and learn. Students without money to pay for lunches can no longer be separated from their peers by putting them at different lunch tables, their hands cannot be stamped, their names cannot be posted and they cannot be required to do chores to pay for their meals. Schools also could not deny students with meal debt the ability to participate in extracurricular or after-school programs.\n\nONLINE LEARNING: Senate File 2131 allows home-schooled students to take online courses through the state's Iowa Learning Online program without enrolling in a public school or an accredited private school. Iowa Learning Online offers a full curriculum, including four levels of English courses, math classes through calculus, science courses including chemistry and physics, and social studies classes such as U.S. history and economics. The bill requires home-school students taking an online course to pay the costs of a course, but the fees cannot result in a profit for the Iowa Department of Education.\n\nPublic safety\n\nLIMITS ON DRUNKEN DRIVING LAWSUITS: Lawmakers approved legislation to limit lawsuits against Iowa businesses serving alcoholic beverages to drunken drivers. Senate File 2169 is intended to ease liability insurance costs for Iowa business owners who say changes were needed to make them competitive with establishments in neighboring Midwest states. Sen. Rick Bertrand, R-Sioux City, complained the Iowa House \"gutted\" it by weakening an earlier version that had lower caps on damages. The legislation's opponents said the measure runs counter to crackdowns on drunken driving and could lead to more traffic crashes, injuries and deaths.\n\nThe bill says non-economic damages awarded to a third party who is not the intoxicated person at fault would be capped at $250,000 for any injury or death. An exception could be made to the limit if a jury determines there is a substantial or permanent loss or impairment of a bodily function, substantial disfigurement, or death, and a plaintiff would be deprived of just compensation for injuries. The bill leaves economic damages uncapped.\n\nIGNITION INTERLOCK BILL: House File 2338 requires an ignition interlock device on any motor vehicle owned or operated by a person with a temporary restricted driver's license in an effort to curb drunken driving. An ignition interlock requires a driver to blow into a mouthpiece, and it prevents a vehicle from starting if the driver has been drinking alcohol. Iowa law had not required first-time violators of drunken-driving laws to install ignition interlocks if their blood-alcohol concentration was between .08 and .10 percent when they were arrested and they weren’t involved in an accident.\n\nLIGHTS ON SNOWPLOW TRUCKS: Flashing blue and white safety lights on Iowa's snowplow trucks can be used statewide to reduce traffic crashes under Senate File 2163. The new law revises a state law that said Iowa's big orange snowplow trucks could be equipped only with amber-colored safety lights. Lawmakers said the change will save money because the average cost of a crash involving a snowplow truck is $7,700 while the cost for installing the new lights is $500 per truck.\n\nCREDIT CARD SKIMMERS: Crooks trying to steal credit card and debit card numbers from Iowa gas pumps and automated teller machines would be guilty of a felony, under this new law. House File 2199 says a person who uses a scanning device or encoding machine to obtain information encoded on a payment card without permission commits a Class D felony. The crime is punishable for up to five years in prison. In the past, a prosecutor has had to show that a skimmer had the intent to defraud the authorized user, the issuer of the authorized user’s payment card, or a merchant. The legislation is aimed at making it easier to put such criminals behind bars.\n\n'SANCTUARY' CITIES: Senate File 481 attempts to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities by revoking state funding for communities that circumvent federal immigration laws. The law says local entities could not prohibit or discourage local law enforcement officers or other employees from \"assisting or cooperating with a federal immigration officer as reasonable or necessary, including providing enforcement assistance.\" Supporters of the legislation say the vast majority of Iowa sheriffs and law enforcement agencies will obey the new law. But they also believe there are some jurisdictions in Iowa not complying with the provisions, and some sheriffs will have to change what they are doing. Critics argue Iowa has no sanctuary cities and the legislation will only stoke racial fears that could fuel discrimination while reducing cooperation between immigrants and law enforcement.\n\nPIPELINE SABOTAGE: Criminal sabotage of Iowa pipelines, telecommunications facilities, water treatment plants and other critical infrastructure could result in long prison sentences and large fines. Senate File 2235 was drafted in the wake of millions of dollars in damage that protesters inflicted on Iowa sections of the Dakota Access Pipeline, before the crude oil pipeline became operational last year. The measure would create the new crime of \"critical infrastructure sabotage,\" which would be a Class B felony. It would be punishable by up to 25 years in prison and a fine up to $100,000. The Republican-led Senate rejected an amendment that would have made it clear the legislation would not ban picketing or other public demonstrations.\n\nBabies, boilers, energy, Dave & Busters, etc.\n\n'SAFE HAVEN' FOR BABIES: Lawmakers agreed to expand Iowa's \"safe haven\" laws, enacted in 2002 and designed to protect newborns. The bill, Senate File 360, passed the Senate last year and the House this year. The previous law allowed parents — or another person who has the parent's authorization — to leave an infant up to 14 days old at a hospital or health care facility without fear of prosecution for abandonment. The legislation expands the law to include babies up to 30 days old. It also allows a person to call 911 to have police or other first responders pick up the baby. The infant would be taken to the nearest institutional health facility.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY CHANGES: Legislation to slash energy efficiency programs financed by utility customers was approved amid a heated debate between Republicans and Democrats on whether the measure will help or hurt Iowa's energy consumers. Senate File 2311 will reduce charges that rate-regulated utilities levy on Iowa customers for energy efficiency projects by $100 million while retaining more than $120 million for energy efficiency projects, Republicans said. The legislation also requires utilities to distribute savings to consumers because of changes in the federal tax code. Other provisions in the bill are intended to help extend natural gas service to under-served communities and provide more transparency for consumers.\n\nDemocrats claimed the changes will result in higher utility bills for Iowa consumers. They also warned 20,000 Iowa jobs will be in jeopardy because the legislation will significantly scale back energy efficiency programs. Iowa Consumer Advocate Mark Schuling, whose staff investigates the legality of rates and practices of Iowa utilities, said the bill is good for utilities but will lead to higher rates for customers.\n\nDAVE & BUSTER'S: Legislation aimed at bringing the Dave & Buster's restaurant and arcade chain to Iowa easily won approval, despite warnings by opponents who claim it represents an expansion of gambling. Until now, Iowa law has limited \"amusement concession\" prizes to $100 or less, a provision discovered by attorneys for Dave & Buster's as the company explored opening restaurants in Iowa. That law regulates places like Chuck E. Cheese, where customers can redeem game tickets or tokens for prizes. But the law had kept Dave & Buster's out of Iowa, because the company offers some prizes like iPads or gaming consoles that far surpass that $100 limit. The measure raises the limit to $950.\n\nELIMINATING BOILER INSPECTIONS: Lawmakers approved a bill that reduces inspections of small boilers and some hot water heaters in buildings the public uses. Iowa law had required inspections for boilers above 50 gallons and 50,000 BTUs. Under House File 2297, the threshold is increased to 120 gallons and 200,000 BTUs. This increase in the inspection exception will eliminate at least 7,648 boilers in public places from inspection. The state boiler board had opposed the legislation, citing public safety concerns. Democratic legislators cited the asphyxiation deaths of four members of a Creston family in Mexico that were linked to a gas leak from a water heater in a rented condominium. Republicans defended the legislation, saying 36 states have similar requirements.\n\nCREDIT REPORTS: Starting July 1, Iowans will not have to pay fees to place or remove freezes on access to their credit reports. Legislators and Attorney General Tom Miller proposed Senate File 2177, saying Iowans pay some of the highest freeze-related fees in the nation to credit reporting agencies.\n\nPIANO COMPETITIONS: House File 2200 authorizes the Terrace Hill Commission to establish an endowment fund for musical arts to support piano competitions and scholarships.\n\nWATER QUALITY: Senate File 512 was the first bill Reynolds signed. It provides an estimated $282 million for water quality initiatives over the next 12 years. Some of the money will come from an existing tax on metered drinking water, which had previously gone into the state's general fund. Another source is gambling tax revenue, which has been used until now to pay off bonds and had flowed into the state's building and infrastructure fund. The bill establishes a water quality infrastructure fund within the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. The fund will support conservation infrastructure, such as wetlands, bioreactors, saturated buffers, terraces and waterways.\n\nREQUIRING SALE OF CONVENTIONAL EGGS: Lawmakers approved a bill requiring Iowa grocers in a supplemental food program to offer conventional eggs if they sell eggs from chickens housed in a cage-free, free-range or enriched colony cage environment. House File 408 covers grocers who participated in the Women, Infants, and Children program, known as WIC. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in cooperation with state officials, and the bill allows state officials to seek a federal waiver if necessary. Supporters of the bill have pointed out that Iowa is the nation's leading egg producer, noting the egg industry provides thousands of jobs and consumes millions of bushels of Iowa corn and soybeans. Critics contend the legislation is evidence that large-scale, corporate-style agriculture is dictating policy decisions at the Iowa Capitol.\n\nSPORTS CONCUSSIONS: Lawmakers approved House File 2442 in reaction to concerns nationally and in Iowa about the impact of brain injuries on athletes. The legislation says that if a student's coach, contest official or licensed health care provider observes symptoms indicating a potential concussion, the student must immediately be removed from participation. The student could not resume play until he or she has been evaluated by a trained health care provider and received written clearance to return. The bill says schools that fully implement the law's protocols and provide a licensed health care provider at a contest will not be liable for any claim for injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of a health care provider who acts reasonably and in good faith.\n\nSENT TO REYNOLDS' DESK\n\nTAX CUTS/TAX POLICY CHANGES: Republicans approved a tax package that will provide Iowa individuals and small business owners $398 million in state income tax cuts in 2019. The biggest percentage of cuts will go to lower income Iowans but the largest savings will fall to richer folks.\n\nWhen fully implemented as soon as 2023, Senate File 2417 will reduce the number of individual income brackets to four, with a top rate of 6.5 percent. The top corporate rate will be lowered to 9.8 percent.\n\nRepublicans said tax reform was needed because Iowa has had the fourth-highest individual income tax rate and the highest corporate tax rate in the nation. If nothing was done to reform Iowa's tax code, Iowans' state taxes would be increasing as a result of federal tax reform simply because of the federal deductibility of taxes, they said.\n\nSTATE BUDGET: Lawmakers approved a series of spending bills to adopt a state operating budget of nearly $7.5 billion for the state fiscal year that begins July 1, 2018. The legislation represents about a 3.2 percent overall increase compared to the current fiscal year, although many state programs will receive much smaller budget increases. That's because about $110 million from the new budget will be used to replenish the state's reserve funds. One of the biggest items in the budget is a $3.2 billion funding package for K-12 schools for the 2018-19 academic year. It represents a 1 percent increase in state aid to schools.\n\nKNOXVILLE RACEWAY TAX BREAK: The Knoxville Raceway, billed as the Sprint Car Capital of the World, will finally become eligible for a $1.8 million rebate in sales taxes under Senate File 2407.\n\nIn 2014, the Legislature approved a state sales tax rebate of $2 million for the Knoxville Raceway to help pay for track improvements intended to keep the business competitive with other racetracks. Since then, only about $18,000 in rebates has been provided to the raceway, and lawmakers said the Iowa Department of Revenue hasn't established administrative rules or established a fund for it. The legislation reduces the size of the rebate to $1.8 million and specifies it would apply to state sales taxes paid between 2015 and 2025.\n\nPASSED, GOVERNOR'S APPROVAL NOT REQUIRED\n\nPRO-GUN AMENDMENT: The Iowa House and Senate approved a resolution to add the \"right to bear arms\" to the Iowa Constitution. However, both chambers must approve the resolution a second time, either in the 2019 or 2020 legislative sessions, before Iowans could vote on a constitutional amendment.\n\nHouse Joint Resolution 2009 says: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The sovereign state of Iowa affirms and recognizes this right to be a fundamental individual right. Any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.\"\n\nSome Democrats contended the wording would add a higher standard in the courts that could prevent lawmakers from requiring gun owners to have permits or undergo background checks, or it could even allow Iowa gun owners to acquire machine guns. Republicans said the strict scrutiny language was to provide guidance to the courts, contending that some activist judges interject their personal views when interpreting laws.\n\nGUBERNATORIAL SUCCESSION: The Iowa House and Senate approved a resolution calling for an amendment to the Iowa Constitution aimed at addressing questions and confusion that arose when former Gov. Terry Branstad left office last year and now-Gov. Kim Reynolds vacated the lieutenant governor's post.\n\nSenate Joint Resolution 2006 says the governor would have the power to fill a vacancy in the office of the lieutenant governor for the rest of a term. It also says that if the governor were unable to serve or left office, the lieutenant governor would become the governor.\n\nIf the governor and lieutenant governor were simultaneously unable to serve, the constitutional amendment says the president of the Senate would become governor. The line of succession would then be as follows: speaker of the House; president pro tempore of the Senate; followed by the speaker pro tempore of the House.\n\nIf none of the above was able or willing to serve as governor and the Legislature was not in session, the Iowa Supreme Court would convene the Legislature by proclamation and the Legislature would elect a Senate president who would become governor.\n\nThe resolution will be referred to the next Iowa General Assembly, which must approve it a second time in either 2019 or 2020 to advance the amendment to Iowa voters for consideration on the November 2020 election ballot.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/20/trump-rallies-in-michigan-after-last-weeks-assassination-attempt/74446648007/", "title": "Trump rallies in Michigan after last week's assassination attempt", "text": "Updated July 20, 2024, 8:48 p.m. ET\n\nHeadlining his first public rally since a failed assassination attempt against him a week ago and two days after formally accepting the GOP's nomination, former President Donald Trump told a raucous, enthusiastic crowd at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids on Saturday evening that Republicans will win Michigan this year having reestablished themselves as \"the party of the people.\"\n\n\"We're a failing nation,\" Trump said early in his speech. \"We cannot let it slip by. We cannot let people cheat. ... Or we're not going to have a country.\"\n\nDuring the address, Trump attacked Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, calling her \"terrible\" and saying, \"I'd like to run against her, actually,\" with President Joe Biden facing pressure from his own party to step down as nominee and Whitmer being mentioned by some as a possible replacement. Trump also rejected Democrats' contention that he is a threat to democracy, arguing it is the Democrats who want to overturn the results of the primary season by talking about getting Biden to step aside.\n\n\"Last week, I took a bullet for democracy,\" said Trump, who wore a small flesh-colored bandage over his right ear, which was injured in last week's shooting. \"What did I do against democracy?\"\n\nSpeaking amid heightened security to a packed audience of supporters that waved signs with Trump's picture and the words, \"Never Surrender,\" and others reading \"Joe Biden, you're fired,\" Trump repeated several false assertions about creating auto jobs in Michigan when he was president and that he was given a \"Man of the Year\" award in Michigan several years ago, which did not happen. He also blamed immigration for an increase in crime; violent crime has been down across the U.S.\n\nHe also excoriated efforts to push automakers to produce and sell electric vehicles while praising Tesla's Elon Musk, who has committed to giving a pro-Trump Super PAC $45 million a month toward reelection. He said he would get rid of federal emission rules that have been characterized as a mandate by Republicans to force the sale of electric cars and trucks.\n\nTrump also falsely suggested an impending invasion of Chinese-run automotive plants operating in Mexico in an effort to flood the U.S. market. The Biden administration has pushed substantial tariffs to prevent Chinese-made EVs from entering the U.S.\n\nTrump was introduced by his running mate, 39-year-old U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who Trump said he picked because Vance is \"for the worker.\" Trump and Vance have spoken at length about using tariffs to protect American workers and products, even though economists argue tariffs cost consumers more, and Vance, specifically, has talked at length about the U.S. staying out of foreign conflicts.\n\nVan Andel Arena, with a capacity to hold some 12,000 people, appeared full.\n\nTrump's speech was ongoing at the deadline for this edition. Go to www.freep.com for updated details about the rally.\n\nTrump talks about shooting, jokes about sign\n\nThe rally took place at a time when the presidential campaign has been upended by events, including the tragic shooting last Saturday at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. In that incident, Trump's ear was wounded, a spectator was killed and two others were critically wounded. Law enforcement shot and killed the would-be assassin, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The FBI has uncovered no specific motive for the attempt.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who was Trump's White House physician, issued a letter Saturday saying he has been seeing Trump regularly since the incident and that, while healing normally, Trump still needs to wear a dressing over the wound.\n\nTrump addressed the shooting again in his speech, crediting the news media for covering it fairly and saying, somewhat pensively. \"It was exactly one week ago today, almost to the hour, almost to the minute. ... What a day it was.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be here,\" he said. \"Something very special happened, let's face it.\"\n\nHe also joked that but for his turning toward a large sign with immigration statistics on it at the instant before the shot passed him, he would have been killed. \"That sign was very good,\" he said. \"I think I'm going to sleep with it tonight.\"\n\nFor someone who had undergone such an incident, Trump's demeanor was easygoing throughout the speech, though he also expressed his sympathies for the family of the man who died and his concern for the other two people who were injured.\n\nTrump says he's not extreme, has 'great common sense'\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's rival, Biden, who is the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, remained isolated with COVID-19 in Delaware, as a growing number of members of his own party called on him to step aside as the nominee ahead of the August convention in Chicago amid worries he is too old and frail at age 81 to beat the 78-year-old Trump. So far, Biden has resisted calls for him to step down as the nominee.\n\nWorries about Biden's ability to beat Trump have grown since he gave a poor performance in a June 27 debate in Atlanta, where he often seemed confused and unable to give coherent responses. As he has battled to retain his spot at the top of the Democratic Party, Biden and his allies — including Whitmer, a co-chair of his national campaign — have urged the media to focus on the threat posed by Trump, arguing that he lies to the American people and constitutes a serious threat to democracy given his efforts to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Biden.\n\nAhead of the rally, Democrats issued warnings about the Republican ticket's agenda. State Party Chairwoman Lavora Barnes accused Trump and Vance of \"championing a dangerous Project 2025 agenda,\" a reference to an effort by former aides and advisers to Trump to enact sweeping changes to the federal government, eliminating the U.S. Department of Education and giving the president more control over Justice Department decisions and hiring and firing civil servants.\n\nTrump and his campaign have said repeatedly they do not endorse Project 2025 and have not said they intend to enact it but Democrats have continued to use it as a warning to voters. On Saturday, Trump specifically said of the project, \"I don't know what the hell it is\" but called some of the recommendations he has heard about \"seriously extreme,\" suggesting he could not support them.\n\n\"The other side is going around trying to make me sound extreme,\" he said. \"I’m a person with great common sense, I’m not extreme at all.\"\n\nThe fact that Trump selected Grand Rapids as the site for his first rally after the shooting and his successful nominating convention isn't surprising, given that he has concluded his campaigning in the city in both of the last two elections and west Michigan is home to a significant bloc of Republican voters.\n\nFans filled the lower bowl of Van Andel arena, sporting an array of Trump gear. Many included references to the shooting Trump survived in Pennsylvania, a theme throughout the evening.\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Tipton, said Trump's survival is evidence of God's presence, while Vance marveled at how the shooting was only days earlier.\n\nBut the crowd roared appreciatively at a few lighthearted jokes — aimed mainly at Vance's status as an Ohio native. During a brief speech before Trump took the stage, Vance said he heard some in the crowd chant \"O-H\", the first half of a well-known Ohio State University cheer.\n\nHe laughed and said he'd have to avoid responding in Grand Rapids, instead noting Republicans from both states need Michigan to win the White House.\n\nVance spoke briefly earlier in the rally\n\nAfter giving a brief summary of his biography, Vance, in a speech that lasted about 10 minutes earlier in the event, criticized Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and blamed both parties for allowing manufacturing jobs to leave the Midwest for overseas. Though there are more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. now than at any time during Trump's presidency, total manufacturing employment in Michigan is below its top mark during Trump's time in office, though it had fallen during the former president's tenure even before COVID-19 shutdowns, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nVance also suggested he and Trump will help get the U.S. out of foreign conflicts that “are none of our business,” presumably referring to American support for Ukraine against Russian aggression.\n\nThe rally was Trump's fifth visit to the state this year, having had rallies in Waterford and outside Saginaw, as well as a roundtable discussion in Grand Rapids on immigration and an event at a Detroit church.\n\nA Democrat who represents Grand Rapids, U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, is the only member so far of Michigan's congressional delegation to join more than 30 others calling for Biden to step aside as nominee.\n\nBiden was most recently in Detroit for a rally last Friday.\n\nMichigan is a key battleground state\n\nMichigan, as it has in recent elections, remains a key swing state and one that appears to have swung more toward Trump in recent polls. Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton by two-tenths of a percentage point on his way to winning the White House in 2016; four years later, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden won the state by about 3 points.\n\nWhitmer released a video in which she welcomed Trump and Vance to Michigan, then excoriated them on their records on abortion rights, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and, in Trump's case, breaking his promises to bring more auto jobs back to Michigan while he was president.\n\n\"Have a good trip!” she concluded.\n\nBut Trump has put himself in a strong position heading into the final four months of the campaign, barring a dramatic change in the Democratic ticket's trajectory. At last week's convention in Milwaukee, Vance — well-known for writing \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" a memoir in which he spoke about addiction and abuse in his family in Ohio — made clear the Republican Party's intention to try to win in the so-called Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

The vote was unanimous after protesters packed a council meeting Tuesday night. Many wore stickers declaring that “poverty is not a crime.” One man held a sign saying, “Jesus was a panhandler.” The amendment would’ve criminalized passing money or objects through car windows to someone on a public road. It was tacked onto an ordinance that requires panhandlers be jailed for at least two days. That ordinance still stands. It was unanimously passed in July but has yet to be enforced or signed by Mayor Todd Strange, who’s in the final days of his term. Mayor-elect Steven Reed takes over the office next Tuesday.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Anyone with unpaid parking fines at the University of Alaska Anchorage campus has the option to reduce or cover the cost of their tickets with peanut butter and jelly. KTUU-TV reports the university says it will take donations for its annual payment tradition until Friday to help combat student hunger. Officials say the food goes to students in need. University officials say each person may use PB&J payments for two citations issued within the past 45 days. Officials say two 16-ounce jars offer a $10 credit, three jars offer a $35 credit, and five jars offer a $60 credit. Officials say any unopened commercially produced nut butter – almond, cashew, peanut – or any flavor jam, jelly, marmalade or preserves will be accepted.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Voters in one of the state’s most liberal cities rejected an initiative Tuesday that would have created the state’s only sanctuary city amid concerns that it went too far in restricting police officers. The measure drew fierce opposition from the mayor and city council, all of them Democrats, who said the initiative risked public safety and millions of dollars the city gets from the state and federal governments. The measure was pushed by activists who wanted to give a voice to Tucson’s Latino community. They said it would have sent the message that immigrants are safe and protected in Tucson at a time when many are fearful of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Officials said Tucson police have already adopted rules that go as far as legally possible to restrict officers from enforcing federal immigration laws.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: The city is shelving a plan to establish a 24-hour curfew in high-crime neighborhoods. Helena-West Helena officials have discussed instituting the measure after three homicides in two days last month. Police Chief James Smith said at the time that he planned to put the issue on the City Council agenda at a meeting Tuesday. But the city is now delaying a decision. Mayor Kevin Smith told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Tuesday that one problem with implementing such a plan is the shortage of facilities for holding people who get arrested as a result of increased police activity. Smith said Helena-West Helena will focus on high-crime areas using current laws and will increase officer training. The city already has a curfew for minors.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Police say they recovered $800,000 worth of prints by Scottish abstract expressionist Benjamin Creme after a caller told them they were in their San Fernando home. Police believe the 1,200 signed prints were there for several years, but the person who had them only recently checked a law-enforcement database and discovered they were stolen. Detectives said Tuesday that the caller, who was not identified, told them they were found in a late relative’s storage locker. They include “Flame-Coloured Deva,” “Shakti II” and other works by Creme, who in later years became better known for his belief in UFOs and predictions of a second coming of Christ and other messiahs. He died in 2016.\n\nColorado\n\nGrand Junction: A former U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist who pleaded guilty to selling Colorado bobcat pelts to fur traders has been sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $55,100 in fines and restitution. During a hearing Tuesday in Grand Junction, U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger also ordered Thad Bingham never to use or possess a firearm again, including weapons he transferred to his wife. He had faced up to 18 months in prison. The Daily Sentinel reports his lawyer, Ashley Petrey, asked for leniency since he lost his job and won’t be able to hunt again. Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Evans said Bingham has two previous poaching convictions and hasn’t learned his lesson. He said Bingham has more than $1 million in assets, enabling him to pay a high fine.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEnfield: A group of prisoners is learning to cope with issues such as post-traumatic stress by interacting with horses. The equine-assisted psychotherapy program is offered in a special Department of Correction unit for military veterans at the Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution in Enfield. Daniel Elliot, who suffered a brain injury while in the Navy, is serving time for an arson he committed while trying to kill himself inside his Norwich apartment. Elliot says the program, run at no charge to the state by the group Healing Hoofbeats, calms him, has helped him open up about his problems and gives him something to look forward to each week. Elliot is one of six inmates participating in the pilot program, which Correction Commissioner Rollin Cook says he hopes to expand to other prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A controversial “blight bill” has suffered another setback in the City Council despite a twist designed to appease critics. With the measure beset for three years by opposition from homeowner, landlord and tenant advocates, council members on Thursday again planned to compromise on the legislation intended to crack down on the owners of vacant and blighted properties. Again, the attempt appeared to fail. The bill passed a committee this week but was pulled from the City Council agenda Wednesday morning. Bill sponsor Bud Freel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After making concessions to homeowners but still facing pushback from other property owners, Freel had planned to push for a vote Thursday – this time with a provision that the changes would be temporary.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Most of the D.C. Council is asking Councilman Jack Evans to resign after a third party released its investigation into allegations of ethics violations. News outlets report the council-hired law firm O’Melveny & Myers publicly released its investigation into Evans this week, saying he violated the council’s ethics rules 11 times since 2014. It says he repeatedly used his office to benefit private clients who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars, payments that he failed to disclose or recognize as conflicts of interest. Such allegations also are under investigation by federal authorities and have already cost Evans his role as chair of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board. Evans’ attorneys released a 67-page rebuttal Tuesday saying the law firm’s report is flawed and misunderstands council ethics rules.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Tourist haven Key West wants to protect coral reefs that attract divers, so it’s banning sunscreens that contain chemicals that could harm them. But state lawmakers who think it’s more important to protect humans are moving toward outlawing the island’s sunscreen ban and making sure no other local governments impose similar ordinances. The battle pits local governments against state government and environmentalists against dermatologists in an argument about coral bleaching and skin cancer. A bill sponsored by Sen. Rob Bradley has been approved in two committees and has one more stop before reaching the full state Senate. An identical House bill was set to make the first of three committee stops Wednesday. The sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate in Key West will be illegal starting in 2021.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp released a plan Monday to expand Medicaid to the state’s poorest able-bodied adults, on the condition that they work, volunteer, receive job training or attend school. Under Kemp’s proposal, which is more limited than efforts in other states, uninsured adults in Georgia who make no more than the federal poverty level would qualify for Medicaid assistance if they spent at least 80 hours a month working, volunteering, training or studying. They would also have to pay monthly premiums. The federal poverty level is just under $12,500 for an individual. The governor’s office called the approach a “conservative reform” that reflects the state’s values as a place that “honors work” and “champions individual responsibility.” It would require approval from the Trump administration.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: The U.S. Air Force has approved a naval facility and airport as the preferred alternative site for a technical squadron tasked with monitoring satellites in support of the national security space mission. The Garden Island reports the Space Control Squadron would operate out of the Barking Sands Pacific Missile Range Facility in western Kauai. Officials say the squadron would ensure that military and other national security agencies have access to satellite communication, intelligence and key information. Officials say the unit is also expected to bring more federal funds and jobs to the state supporting 88 new Hawaii Air National Guard positions. Federal officials say the basing process is expected to be completed by 2020, with the unit becoming partially operational by 2021 and fully operational by 2022.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A giant forest project in the state that was rejected by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is on again, and an environmental group says it violates the court’s orders and vows it will stop it with another lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service on Friday approved the 125-square-mile project on the Payette National Forest, with work expected to start this week. The Forest Service and the Alliance for the Wild Rockies agree the project is precisely the same as the one halted by the 9th Circuit Court’s ruling against the Forest Service in August 2018. But the Forest Service says changes in wording in an environmental review remove problems that caused the court to stop the project, and the Forest Service’s new approval decision Friday allows work to begin immediately.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state is receiving federal money to help build infrastructure for alternative-fuel vehicles along Interstate 80. The Illinois Department of Transportation says the grant is part of an effort to create an alternative-fuel corridor that supports electric vehicles and vehicles that run on natural gas. It will span six states, from New Jersey to the Iowa-Nebraska border. The $70,000 in federal funds will be combined with $10,000 each from Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The money will be used to identify gaps along Interstate 80 where fueling and charging facilities aren’t available and to provide those options. Omer Osman, acting secretary of IDOT, says that “these improvements will help make interstate travel on alternative fuel a reality” and make travel more environmentally friendly.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will be home to the nation’s newest National Guard cyber battalion. State officials say the 127th Cyber Battalion will be composed of about 100 soldiers who will be trained in cybersecurity and cyber warfare at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, about 75 miles southeast of Indianapolis. Army National Guard officials say they chose Indiana’s force for its existing cyber capabilities, partnerships with industry and academia, and the ability to recruit and retain soldiers. Gov. Eric Holcomb says the state is a “natural fit” for the first cyber battalion in the Midwest. The battalion is expected to be fully operational by 2022. There are four other cyber battalions in the country: two in Virginia, one in South Carolina and another in Massachusetts.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: Joy, the American Mini Spokes-Pig for the Capitol II Theatre, has been recognized for her talents by Guinness World Records. In the 2020 edition of the famous record book, Joy was officially named the fastest trick porker in the universe. Her feat, overseen by two judges – Newton’s mayor and the city’s chief of police – was successfully completing 13 tricks, each initiated by a different command, in under a minute. A ham in more ways than one, Joy is a local celebrity and performer with her own dressing room at the theater – a peek-a-boo window lets visitors steal a gander of her from the street. And Joy is always red-carpet ready, of course, complete with painted toenails and her favorite dress, a resplendent taffeta number emblazoned with cartoon popcorn buckets (her favorite food).\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The acting secretary of the state Department of Corrections said during his confirmation hearing that a mass commutation of offenders was worth considering. The Wichita Eagle reports Jeff Zmuda was asked to comment Tuesday on what happened one day earlier, when more than 450 inmates walked out the doors of prisons across Oklahoma as part of a massive commutation. Zmuda said Kansas officials are looking at several ways to make reforms and ease overcrowding, and “that’s certainly one that could be considered.” Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning said releasing nonviolent inmates “sounds like a fantastic idea” but cautioned that if someone who has been released early commits a violent act, “there’s hell to pay.” The hearing ended with a Senate committee recommending that Zmuda be confirmed. The full Senate will vote early next year.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State Senate President Robert Stivers threw another wrench into a razor-thin gubernatorial outcome late Tuesday night, saying the Legislature could decide the race. Stivers’ comments came shortly after Gov. Matt Bevin refused to concede to Attorney General Andy Beshear, who led by roughly 5,100 votes when all the precincts were counted. Stivers, R-Manchester, said based on his staff’s research, the decision could come before the GOP-controlled Legislature. Under state law, Bevin has 30 days to formally contest the outcome once it is certified by the State Board of Elections. Candidates typically ask for a recanvass of voting machines and a recount first. The last contested governor’s race was the 1899 election of Democrat William Goebel. Stivers said he believes most of the votes that went to Libertarian John Hicks, who received about 2% of the total vote, would have gone to Bevin and made him the clear winner.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three months after medical marijuana became available in the state, doctors and clinics say some patients are finding the cost for therapeutic cannabis too high for treatment, pricing them out of a medication they waited years to obtain. Nine pharmacies dispense medicinal-grade pot and set their individual prices. Dispensary owners say their charges reflect an industry with startup charges, small patient numbers and lengthy regulatory hurdles to meet. In August, Louisiana became the first Deep South state to dispense medical marijuana, four years after state lawmakers agreed to give patients access. Kathryn Thomas, CEO of The Healing Clinics, says a third of the medical marijuana patients across its five clinics in Shreveport, Monroe, Baton Rouge, Houma and Lafayette can’t foot the bill for the product.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: It’s almost safe to be a turkey in Maine again. The Pine Tree State’s fall wild turkey season ends for the year Thursday. The fall turkey hunt is the longer of the state’s two turkey hunts, with a more restricted season taking place every spring. Wild turkeys are popular game birds, and the state uses the hunt to control their population. The animals were once rare in Maine but are now so common that they sometimes cause traffic accidents and other hazards. Hunters are allowed to take up to five wild turkeys of either sex in some parts of the state. However, parts of far northern Maine are closed to turkey hunting.\n\nMaryland\n\nRockville: Departments and agencies in Montgomery County are embarking on a campaign to make residents aware of the added challenges of the switch to standard time. The approximately 20 planned “Be Safe, Be Seen” events, the first of which was held Wednesday at the Shady Grove Metro Station, are aimed at both adults and children. The campaign will distribute safety literature, reflective stickers, and items that will remind people to avoid distractions and maximize safe behaviors and visibility, especially in darkness. A 2016 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that 26% of all pedestrian deaths occurred between 6 p.m. and 8:59 p.m. Because peak evening commuting times in fall and winter occur during periods of increased darkness, danger is increased.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: First lady Melania Trump on Wednesday visited a hospital that uses cuddling to help infants born dependent on drugs or alcohol. She met with caregivers and administrators at Boston Medical Center and told them she’s “very focused” on their pioneering work with babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. “I hope today’s visit helps shine a light on programs like yours,” she said, joined by Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services. Outside, as many as 200 workers at the hospital gathered to protest the visit, condemning the tough immigration policies of President Donald Trump’s administration that they say discourage immigrants from getting health care. Some wore white hospital jackets with the slogan “We really do care, do you?” on the backs. Others carried signs that read, “BMC cares for all patients.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: A new forecast says Great Lakes levels are likely to remain unusually high and may set additional records. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in Detroit on Monday released its outlook for the next six months. Hydrologist Keith Kompoltowicz says a wet October interrupted the usual fall drop-off of water levels. Storms over Lakes Michigan, Huron and Superior caused beach erosion, flooding, and damage to seawalls and roads. Kompoltowicz says all five Great Lakes are expected to resume their seasonal decline. But they’ll remain well above normal and will be higher in January than they were at the beginning of this record-setting year. He says Huron and Michigan are likely to set monthly records in February, while Superior will come close. Kompoltowicz says a lengthy dry spell would be required to reverse the trend.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Winter anglers on Mille Lacs Lake will be allowed to keep one walleye this winter for the fourth season in a row. The Department of Natural Resources announced winter regulations for Mille Lacs on Monday. Similar to last winter, anglers can keep one walleye starting Dec. 1 if it’s between 21 and 23 inches, or over 28. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen says there’s evidence the state’s conservative approach to managing the popular lake is paying off. A fall assessment found the Mille Lacs walleye population has remained relatively stable over the past three years, having rebounded from lows seen from 2012 through 2016. Fisheries chief Brad Parsons says they expect the walleye bite on Mille Lacs to be quite good this winter, which will likely result in a high harvest.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A new historical marker is honoring the oldest continuously operating African American church in the state. Members of St. Peter Baptist Church in Pascagoula gathered Saturday to celebrate the unveiling of a marker that was placed by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The coastal church was founded in 1819 by a freed slave named Dudley Brooks. It originally was called First Free Mission Baptist Church. Pastor William H. Marshall tells WLOX-TV that he’s pleased the congregation is being recognized by the state. Congregants buried a time capsule with church programs and other items. The plan is to dig it up in 20 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved removing Dr. Martin Luther King’s name from one of the city’s most historic boulevards, less than a year after the City Council decided to rename the Paseo for the civil rights icon. Unofficial results showed the proposal to remove King’s name received nearly 70% of the vote, with just over 30% voting to retain King’s name. The city had been one of the largest in the country without a street named for him. But a group of residents intent on keeping the Paseo name began collecting petitions to put the name change on the ballot and achieved that goal in April. The campaign has been divisive. Emotions reached a peak Sunday, when members of the “Save the Paseo” group staged a silent protest at a get-out-the-vote rally at a black church.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The speed limit on a deadly stretch of U.S. 212 in southeast Montana has been reduced to 65 mph. The Billings Gazette reports the Montana Department of Transportation lowered the speed limit Oct. 1 on the highway’s corridor that passes through both the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Reservations and four counties: Big Horn, Rosebud, Powder River and Carter. The stretch merges with Interstate 90 at the Bighorn Battlefield interchange and travels 167 miles east to the Montana-Wyoming state line. MDOT Traffic and Safety Bureau chief Gabe Priebe says statistics show the stretch is the deadliest highway in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Speakers at a public hearing have criticized a proposal that could lead to the firing of elected officials in this Omaha suburb for leaking information from closed meetings. The first proposal says dissemination of information from closed sessions by an elected official could result in an “allegation of misconduct.” The second proposal says a finding of misconduct could result in that official’s removal from office. Former Bellevue Councilman Jim Moudry said at Tuesday night’s hearing that he was troubled by the notion the city would be able to decide what behaviors constitute misconduct. Councilman Chuck Fredrick and other said such decisions belong to voters. Councilwoman Kathy Welch backed the proposals, saying the city holds employees to high standards when conducting city business, so it should be no different for elected officials.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Despite protests about a “war on the poor,” city officials passed a law Wednesday making it illegal for the homeless to sleep on streets when beds are available at established shelters. The issue spurred emotion and drama, including the ejection by city marshals of several audience members whom Mayor Carolyn Goodman deemed disruptive during a daylong City Council meeting that drew dozens of time-limited comments. Most people spoke against the law before the 5-2 council vote. The measure will apply to the city’s downtown urban core, not the tourist-heavy Las Vegas Strip, which is overseen by a different jurisdiction. Goodman, the sponsor of the measure, called it imperfect but necessary to deal with what officials and downtown business owners characterize as a homeless crisis.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Division of Historical Resources has added eight properties to its historic register, including five from Litchfield’s town center. The buildings along Route 3A include the Gothic Revival Litchfield Presbyterian Church; the Greek Revival Town Hall; the Tudor Revival Aaron Cutler Memorial Library; the Colonial Revival Griffin Memorial School; and the Litchfield Fire Station. The church and town hall go back to the mid-1800s. Other properties include the George Burrell residence in Keene, an 1853 predominantly brick Italianate-style house; the Willing Workers Hall in Warren, a social hall built in 1815; and Westmoreland’s Federal-style Brick Church, built in 1838.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The mayor is denying he engaged in prohibited campaigning during voting on hotly contested measures restricting Airbnb and other short-term rental companies. A short video posted online Tuesday shows Mayor Steven Fulop speaking to someone inside a polling place near a voting booth. The conversation isn’t entirely intelligible, but Fulop can be heard saying, ‘So vote ‘yes.’ ” At a news conference Wednesday, Fulop said he was thanking poll workers and didn’t approach anyone or hand out literature. State law bans soliciting support or distributing literature within 100 feet of a polling place. A spokesman for Keep Our Homes, an organization opposed to the measures, said in an email that Fulop’s actions showed “a shocking disregard for the law.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Presbyterian Healthcare Services and the University of New Mexico are teaming to lure nurses into some of the state’s most rural areas. The Albuquerque Journal reports the two health care organizations recently collaborated to land a $3.2 million grant to develop a residency program for nurse practitioners in 10 New Mexico cities and towns. The four-year grant from the national Health Resources and Services Administration will help nurses and midwives relocate and stay in remote areas. Officials say the program also will focus on mental health. Presbyterian Director of Clinical Education and Professional Development Johanna Stiesmeyer says New Mexico’s rural counties have a wide nurse-to-resident ratio. The first group of nurses and midwives will be selected in the first half of 2020.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: President Donald Trump isn’t a fan of the state’s new bail reform law, which will curtail the number of people jailed while awaiting trial. The president tweeted Tuesday that New York’s Democratic governor and mayor “are letting out 900 Criminals, some hardened & bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining” city. That was a reference to estimates from New York City’s corrections officials on the number of prisoners who might be eligible for release under the new law. Gov. Andrew Cuomo punched back, saying Trump gave up his right to call New York home when he recently claimed Florida residency. The state’s law was passed to address complaints that poor people accused of minor crimes were often jailed for long periods because they couldn’t afford to post bail.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKnightdale: An assistant high school football coach has resigned after making racist comments on Instagram. News outlets report John Hoskins resigned over the weekend from his post at Knightdale High School. WTVD-TV reports Hoskins, who is white, posted a now-deleted video to Instagram in which he said “white power” and the n-word. Hoskins told the station Tuesday that “just to set the record, I’m not a racist.” He says his black friends have given him the OK to use the word, as have players on the majority-black team that he coached. He says he posted the video and used the slur while caught up in celebrating the team’s win against Corinth Holders High last week. The video was shared with administrators before Hoskins deleted it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum is urging U.S. Customs and Border Protection not to cut hours of operation at three entry ports on the North Dakota-Canadian border. Border Protection has proposed moving back the closing time at the Maida and Carbury crossings from 10 p.m. to 7 p.m. and the Antler crossing from 10 p.m. to 5 p.m. In a letter to the CBP, Burgum noted all three ports experienced an increase in automobile and truck crossings in fiscal year 2018. Burgum says he’s concerned reducing the hours of operation will have a negative impact on tourism, movement of goods and local economies. The agency says that it wants to use its resources at the busiest locations and that there are low numbers of crossings during the times it plans to cut.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voters have approved nearly three-quarters of the public school district tax issues that were on ballots across the state for Tuesday’s election. The Ohio School Boards Association says unofficial results show voters passed 113 of the 154 school tax issues on the ballot, or 73%. The association says just over half of the proposals were renewals, and all but a few of those 82 renewal measures were approved. There was less support for new school tax issues, as only 35 of those 72 issues were passed. The votes come as state lawmakers are considering a possible overhaul of how Ohio schools are funded with a mix of state and local dollars. Ohio’s school-funding system has become a complicated patchwork since the system was found unconstitutional in 1997.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure. The high court acted Monday after an abortion clinic appealed a lower court judge’s decision to uphold a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure. The Tulsa Women’s Reproductive Clinic requested the temporary injunction to put the law on hold, telling justices the law would be detrimental for women. The 2015 law would restrict the use of instruments in dilation and evacuation abortions after 14 weeks of pregnancy, except when needed to save the woman’s life or prevent a serious risk to her health. It had been on hold while the legal challenge was pending. State numbers show nearly 7% of about 5,000 abortions performed in Oklahoma in 2018 were performed using this method.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A year ago a California group rejected more than 2,000 tons of wine grapes grown in Southern Oregon for supposed smoke taint from wildfire impact in the region, representing a $4 million dollar collective loss for more than 15 grape growers in the Rogue Valley. This year, a collective of Willamette Valley winemakers is being recognized with a national award for what they did next. The wineries quickly made arrangements to bring some of the fruit north. Based on lab results from each lot, they believed the grapes had been rejected without cause. They labeled their collaborative wines Oregon Solidarity Wines and pledged proceeds from their sale back to the grape growers. Wine Enthusiast Magazine has awarded Oregon Solidarity with a 2019 Wine Star Award for Innovator of the Year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Democrats completed an electoral sweep of the metro area’s four suburban counties, long a bastion of Republican control and a crucial bellwether for statewide candidates. Democrats won control in Delaware and Chester counties in Tuesday’s election for the first time going back to the Civil War and won control in Bucks County for the first time since the 1980s. Democrats took control of Montgomery County several years ago. The fast-growing counties now account for more than 1 in 5 of all registered voters, and they tend to vote in higher proportions than the rest of the state. The Democratic victories in Delaware and Chester counties were particularly strong, winning every countywide race. For three decades, the counties had been growing increasingly liberal, but the trend seems to have accelerated since Donald Trump’s election as president.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An analysis of the city’s electronic bike and scooter share shows users took nearly 170,000 scooter rides and more than 280,000 bike rides in the first year of the programs. The city report also contains information on average trips and areas where the devices were most popular. City councilmember Jo-Ann Ryan requested the analysis about three months ago and tells the Providence Journal the six-page report downplays public safety concerns and is missing information on routes, accident data and public input. Ryan says a comprehensive report is needed to inform future policies and prevent some of the issues that have cropped up. Providence announced in August that it was temporarily pulling the electronic bikes operated by the company JUMP over concerns of their misuse.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: After two decades of decline, the state’s infant mortality rate has inched up, largely due to an increase in birth defects and premature births, state health officials said Wednesday. The state’s infant mortality rate declined 30% since 1999 but increased from 6.5 deaths to 7.2 per 1,000 births between 2017 to 2018, a 10.8% increase, said Kimberly Seals, director of the Department of Health and Environmental Control’s Bureau of Maternal and Child Health. During that time, infant deaths related to birth defects increased from 64 to 82, or 28%, she said. And the number of deaths related to prematurity or low birthweight increased from 52 to 58, or 11%, she said. In addition, Seals said, the infant mortality rate was 2.2 times higher among minorities.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem has reiterated her opposition to legalizing industrial hemp production, even in the face of new federal rules allowing the cash crop. Hemp is seen as a possible boon by many farmers, but Noem said in a statement Tuesday that legalizing it would hamper enforcement of marijuana laws. But the governor also says South Dakota will allow the crop to be transported across the state. Last month, police arrested a Colorado man for carrying large bags of what he claims was hemp in his SUV. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a new regulatory framework for hemp production last week, saying it will provide new economic opportunities for farmers and pave the way for new products and markets.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: To help alleviate issues with driver’s license facilities, the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security is looking to hire 80 employees, expand hours of operation, consider outsourcing some operations and implement recommendations from a more than decade-old study. That’s what the agency’s top official, Commissioner Jeff Long, told Gov. Bill Lee and his administration Wednesday while outlining the department’s budgetary needs for the upcoming fiscal year. Although it oversees the Tennessee Highway Patrol, homeland security and the safety of residents in the Volunteer State, the agency has received a considerable amount of attention for continued issues regarding the issuance of driver’s licenses. With 44 official driver’s license facilities throughout the state, the agency has faced frustration over long wait times and technology crashes.\n\nTexas\n\nKilleen: Family members of the 13 people killed in a mass shooting at the Fort Hood military base have marked the 10th anniversary of the attack. A ceremony was held Tuesday at Fort Hood in Killeen to remember the victims of the Nov. 5, 2009, attack. Thirteen people were killed and more than 30 others injured when then-U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan opened fire at the base. Hasan was sentenced to death for the killings. But the Killeen Daily Herald reports many of the victims’ families expressed frustration that no execution date has been set for Hasan, who is among four soldiers on military death row.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah says a new mental health institute funded by a $150 million donation from the influential Huntsman family will focus on researching the genetic causes of mental illnesses and provide more treatment to college students and rural residents. The university said in a news release Monday that the Huntsman Mental Health Institute will aim to provided research-based treatment. The donation will also help fund the University of Utah Health’s psychiatry department. The Huntsmans already have a major cancer research center in Utah that bears the family name. The late Jon Huntsman Sr. was the founder of a company that refines raw materials that go into thousands of products. One of his sons, Peter Huntsman, says he hopes the institute help change the stigma and misperceptions about mental health.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: A church will begin hosting a morning “warming center” for the winter season. The United Community Church in St. Johnsbury announced its “warming center” will be open seven days a week beginning Nov. 15, the same day the overnight warming shelter opens. The church’s effort to house an overnight shelter was met with opposition from St. Johnsbury Select Board members in 2015. The board had added language to the town’s bylaws forbidding shelters outside the health services zone. The Caledonian Record reports the decision to host the warming program follows a five-month pilot program last year. The community organizers say the morning center is open to anyone in the community. The center will operate from 7:30 a.m. to noon Monday through Sunday.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A Democratic candidate who lost a random drawing that determined control of the state House of Delegates nearly two years ago easily won a rematch against her Republican opponent. Shelly Simonds defeated four-term Del. David Yancey handily Tuesday in a race for the 94th District in Newport News. The close 2017 race between the two went to a recount, then to court. Eventually, officials used the luck of the draw, placing the name of each candidate on a piece of paper and each piece of paper in a separate film canister. The canisters were put into a cobalt blue-and-white ceramic bowl made by a local artist and stirred around. The canister containing Yancey’s name was drawn, giving him the win. On Tuesday, Simonds won nearly 58% of the vote. Yancey won about 40%.\n\nWashington\n\nKennewick: The City Council has repealed its decade-old rules governing dangerous dogs after a new state law weakened breed-specific regulations. The Tri-City Herald reports the Legislature passed a state law requiring cities with breed-specific legislation to exempt dogs that can be certified as good canine citizens by the American Kennel Club or other organizations. Kennewick City Council voted Tuesday to get rid of its former regulations instead of adopting rules exempting well-mannered dogs. Officials say Kennewick first adopted breed-specific regulations after increased reports about injuries inflicted by dangerous dogs like pit bulls. Advocates and pit bull owners say regulations included having special licenses and muzzling dogs in public. Officials say the rules do not exempt owners from liability if their pets attack.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia American Water has awarded grants to provide bottle-filling stations to 10 groups throughout the utility’s service area. The company says in a statement that the program is aimed at reducing plastic waste from single-use bottles and providing filling stations to nonprofit groups, schools and local government facilities. Among the groups that were selected from more than 90 applications are the AD Lewis Community Center in Huntington and Salt Rock Elementary School in Cabell County; the Fayette County Public Library in Oak Hill; the Putnam County Public Library in Hurricane; and Lewis County High School and the Lewis County Park in Weston. Other groups involved include Mercer Elementary School in Princeton and CAMC Women and Children’s Hospital, the West Virginia Capitol Complex and Flinn Elementary School, all in Charleston.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State legislators struggled Wednesday with a bill that would force schools to teach cursive writing, questioning whether they should make teachers spend time and money preserving the centuries-old style in today’s computerized world. Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt, a former teacher, introduced the bill in September that would require schools receiving state dollars to include cursive in their elementary curriculum, with the goal of having students write legibly in cursive by the end of fifth grade. Thiesfeldt’s bill wouldn’t come cheap, at least according to state education officials, but he tried to make a case for the measure during a public hearing in front of the Assembly’s state affairs committee Wednesday afternoon. He said studies have shown writing in cursive fosters neurological connections in students’ brains, improves retention and can help dyslexic children read because cursive letters are more distinctive than printed letters.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Association of Broadcasters says it will push state lawmakers to pass a media shield law. Wyoming is the only state in the nation without legal protections for journalists who refuse to provide the names of confidential sources to law enforcement officers. Such laws can encourage whistleblowers to report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. Wyoming Association of Broadcasters lobbyist Laura Grott says the state lacks a shield law not because of opposition but because of a lack of effort by Wyoming media. The broadcast journalist group unveiled the proposal at a recent meeting of the Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Wyoming Press Association has largely resisted a media shield law. The newspaper organization argues existing First Amendment protections are enough for the press and their sources.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/27/donald-trump-second-term-first-100-days/83208889007/", "title": "Trump's actions in first 100 days are a shock — but not a surprise", "text": "April 27, 2025, 6:02 a.m. ET\n\nTo a breathtaking degree, the first 100 days of President Donald Trump's second, nonconsecutive term have shattered any preexisting standard, even his own.\n\nIn 2017, he opened with what seemed an ominous and aggressive start, signing a handful of executive orders in the first week, including those weakening enforcement of the Affordable Care Act and making an initial attempt to enact a travel ban on people from majority Muslim countries.

By combining resources and investing more than $1 billion to retool existing factories in Marysville, East Liberty, and Anna and at least $4.4 billion to build a new battery plant in Jeffersonville with LG Energy Solutions, Honda has dubbed Ohio its \"EV Hub.\"\n\nHonda will begin making its latest electric vehicles in Ohio late this year, starting with an Acura SUV called the \"RSX.\" The operating system in Honda's new EVs will be named ASIMO, paying homage to the robot that became a pop culture phenomenon and was retired by the company a few years ago.\n\nRead More: Honda unveils latest 0 series electric vehicles in Las Vegas\n\nHonda's transformation represents a turning point for its Ohio factories and the company as a whole that its leaders see as a rebirth of the nearly 80-year-old automaker.\n\n\"We are pursuing the second founding of Honda,\" said Bob Schwyn, senior vice president of Honda Development and Manufacturing in America. \"It's an effort to think and act more like a startup company and to realize the future mobility that our customers desire.\"\n\nWhile electric vehicles have changed the auto industry, Honda itself could soon look a lot different if a planned merger between Honda and Nissan that was announced last year becomes a reality. But, the merger isn't expected to have any immediate impact on Honda's EV plans, spokesman Chris Abbruzzese told The Dispatch.\n\nHonda gave The Dispatch a preview of the electric vehicle operations it's setting up in Marysville and at its Anna engine plant.\n\nAs part of its EV hub, Honda will seek to have zero environmental impact by the year 2050, which includes becoming carbon neutral, recycling and reusing resources and using clean energy sources.\n\nAlthough much preparation remains before Honda's first electric vehicles roll off the assembly line, some areas of its factories in Marysville and Anna have already been completely reworked.\n\nIn an area previously used as a painting line at the Marysville plant, workers will soon piece together batteries in their cases before they're installed onsite and welded into the floor of new vehicles. Unlike the dimly-lit factories of yesteryear, Honda has added bright lights and white walls and ceilings to the space so workers can see what they're doing better.\n\nPiece by piece, former assembly lines in Marysville are being dismantled to make way for new EV lines at the plant. And all of this work has been done in a way that has allowed Honda to continue making cars during construction.\n\nOnce it's complete, the new setup in Marysville will allow Honda to respond to consumer demand and market shifts. If the plant needs to make more electric vehicles, more hybrid models or traditional combustion engine cars, it'll be able to shift gears and do so, said Mike Fischer, project lead of Honda's North American electric vehicle project.\n\n\"We have to have flexibility to shift,\" Fischer said. \"That's why we chose to do an existing facility in Ohio ... where we have the ability to do (traditional vehicles) and meet whatever that customer demand is.\"\n\nHonda officials pointed to the flexibility of the company's plants in response to questions about whether President Donald Trump's stance on electric vehicles will impact the automaker's plans.\n\nTrump has pledged to revoke President Joe Biden's previous electric vehicle mandate and potentially kill a $7,500 tax credit for buyers of EVs. But pro-EV policies embedded in the U.S. tax code and the Clean Air Act could be difficult for Trump to dismantle via executive order and make it unclear just how much the president alone will impact production and demand.\n\n\"Until an actual policy change is made, it is too early to speculate on how it would impact our sales and production strategies,\" Abbruzzese said. \"We see electrification as a marathon, not a sprint, and we are still in the early stages of the race.\"\n\nAlong with the Acura RSX, two other Honda models are set to be made in Ohio, either at the Marysville plant or the East Liberty plant.\n\nThe Honda 0 SUV and Honda 0 Saloon, unveiled at the Consumer Electronic Show in January, are expected to launch in North America in 2026, according to the automaker. Although the Saloon is considered the flagship vehicle for the 0 line of cars, the SUV is expected to enter production first.\n\nHonda 0 Series vehicles will be equipped with a system that will eventually allow for what the automaker calls \"eyes-off\" driving. The automated system will allow the Honda 0 Series vehicle to handle the driving so that a human driver can perform another task, such as watching a movie or remotely joining a meeting, according to the company.\n\nTo bring Honda's 0 line to fruition, the company will lean on other resources it has in the Buckeye State.\n\nAt Honda's Anna Engine Plant, workers will make cases for each car's large battery packs.\n\nThe company installed six 6,000-ton high-pressure die cast machines to form molten metal into the shape of EV battery case parts. The Anna plant will be able to make two sizes of battery cases for large and midsize vehicles, according to Honda.\n\nAfter the battery cases are made, they'll be placed in a container with 90 different cameras and following final assembly they'll moved into a container with 120 cameras. Within a matter of seconds, the cameras will be able to inspect the quality of each case through a process called \"photogrammetry\" to ensure they meet Honda's standards, according to the company.\n\nIn keeping with Honda's plans to reach zero environmental impact by 2050, the cases won't go too far after final inspection. The battery cases will move from Anna to plants in Marysville and East Liberty to be used in electric vehicles that eventually roll off the updated assembly lines — bringing part of the supply chain full circle inside Ohio.\n\n\"Our team found creative and challenging ways to use our existing facilities to make something new,\" Fischer said. \"The Honda EV hub in Ohio is establishing a global standard.\"\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/02/21/gm-global-changes/2864673002/", "title": "GM's global gamble to fund a big bet on the future - Detroit Free Press", "text": "Feb. 21, 2019 Updated Feb. 22, 2019, 5:28 p.m. ET\n\nIn the summer of 2015, about a dozen of General Motors' top brass flew to Silicon Valley for a series of not-your-father's auto industry meetings. Over the course of a week, the leaders sat down with Google, Facebook, venture capitalists and Stanford University experts to talk technology and its impact on mobility.\n\n\"We were seeing this massive disruption coming to the auto industry,\" said Tony Cervone, referring to electric and self-driving vehicles.\n\nCervone, GM's head of communications, was on the Silicon Valley trip, and remembers its impact: “We came back asking how do we lead the disruption by disrupting ourselves?”\n\nIt was a profound question for CEO Mary Barra, still relatively new at the time. She was already working to fix GM's finances and dodge the profit pitfalls that led it into bankruptcy and a government bailout in 2009.\n\nGM already had pulled Chevrolet out of a money-losing business in Europe in 2013. Barra, who took over as CEO in 2014, then pulled the plug on GM in Russia and Indonesia a year later, where GM was bleeding cash.\n\nBut the trip to Silicon Valley signaled that GM's leaders knew the future was going to mean behaving markedly different from the past.\n\nSo while GM's recent job cuts and plant closures dominate today's headlines, the roots of its restructuring actually took shape five years ago as GM changed its global business, selling some operations, restructuring others and making a big bet on electrification and autonomous cars.\n\nWhile attention is focused on North America, the company continues reshaping its global operations, cutting and restructuring to ensure profitability.\n\nHere's a look at the crucial plays the 110-year-old automaker made and what its leaders believe it must do to stay relevant for another century.\n\nBooting bureaucracy\n\nFrom 2005-08, the \"old\" GM lost about $86 billion. It ultimately led to filing for federal bankruptcy protection and a government bailout.\n\nAs part of its bankruptcy and bailout, GM was forced to make significant structural changes. In 2009, it closed 11 assembly plants in North America and dropped Hummer, Pontiac, Saturn and Saab brands. It cut production by 1.3 million vehicles, or 22 percent of GM’s capacity in the process, according to LMC Automotive's Jeff Schuster.\n\nThe \"new\" GM regained financial footing, but when Barra took over in 2014, she walked into a firestorm ultimately requiring her to testify to Congress about the company's ignition switch scandal.\n\nGM had produced more than 2.7 million small cars with faulty ignition switches that could shut off the engine during driving, preventing the air bags from inflating. The company knew about the defect and risk for years without acting. The result was at least 124 people were killed and 275 were injured. It cost GM close to $120 million for claims and penalties and settlements of an estimated $2.5 billion, including $900 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice criminal case.\n\nInsiders say that out of the scandal, Barra realized GM's culture was too mired in bureaucracy with ineffective communication among departments. The company was a lethargic behemoth, out of step with the quickly evolving market.\n\n\"GM was always a company where making a decision would take 10 weeks when it should take 10 minutes,\" said Maryann Keller, principal of Maryann Keller & Associates an industry analyst based in New York. \"This company couldn't execute quickly. What I see Mary Barra creating is a company where she demands the information that emboldens her to make what she believes is the right decision and move quickly.\"\n\nFar East funding\n\nOne of the first things Barra and her team did was assess GM's strengths and weaknesses around the world. It exited Russia and announced it would cease production of GM-branded cars in Indonesia in 2015.\n\nThen, at GM's Global Business Conference in October 2015, Barra outlined the company's big play for the future: improve GM's core business so it can fund investment in autonomous vehicles, electrification, connectivity and ride-sharing — the topics it talked about with the sultans of Silicon Valley earlier that year.\n\n“The convergence of rapidly improving technology and changing consumer preferences is creating an inflection point for the transportation industry not seen in decades,” Barra said at the 2015 conference. “Some might find this massive change to be daunting, but we look at it and see the opportunity to be a disruptor. We believe our decades of leadership in vehicle connectivity is fundamental to our quest to redefine the future of personal mobility.”\n\nAs GM looked to the future, it also looked to the Far East to fund it. The company had a solid foothold in the fastest-growing market in the world: China. In 2016, GM said it would roll out about 60 new models through 2020 to meet demand for SUVs, luxury cars and electric vehicles in China. GM also had a long and strong partnership with SAIC Motor in China, where it builds and sells Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac brands. GM's growth plan there locked in a large, long-term revenue stream, analysts said.\n\nLast year, GM China reported equity income of $2 billion in China despite a softening market. That's consistent with 2017 and 2016 results. Cadillac sales in China rose 17.2 percent year over year.\n\n\"China is the world's largest car market and the world's largest EV market,\" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader in Detroit. \"Despite last year's setback — the first time sales dipped in 20 years — and a flat year expected for 2019, China will return to growth mode and become the world's largest car and EV market by an even wider margin in the future.\"\n\nFarewell Europe\n\nBut Europe was a different story.\n\nGM was reporting a pretax loss of at least $1 billion each year since 2012 from its operations in Europe, according to its annual earnings filings.\n\nSo in March 2017, GM sold its money-losing European operation, Opel-Vauxhall, to French automaker PSA Group for $2.2 billion.\n\nGM had controlled Opel-Vauxhall for 90 years and it made up 10 percent of GM's global sales and 18 percent of its workforce. The company decided that cutting loose the operation would allow it to focus on more profitable markets, core products and technology such as electric cars, fuel cells and self-driving vehicles.\n\nLater that year, GM terminated more overseas operations by selling its South Africa business to Isuzu and ending sales in India.\n\n\"Getting out of India, that was interesting,\" said Schuster, the LMC analyst. \"That could be challenging because it could be the next great emerging market. But it's been in that position for a few years and still hasn't delivered.\"\n\nMeanwhile, GM and SAIC in China delivered 4.04 million vehicles that year.\n\nRocky overseas sailing\n\nIn the early spring of 2018, Barra and GM leaders zeroed in on operations in South Korea.\n\nGM got an agreement with its South Korean labor union to cut costs and allocate new car models to GM Korea factories. The deal steered GM away from filing for bankruptcy protection for its loss-making Korean unit. It also paved the way for support from the Korea Development Bank, which holds a 17-percent stake in GM Korea.\n\nGM closed a plant in Gunsan last year and took a pretax charge of $942 million in the first quarter on '18 from restructuring at its South Korea operations. GM says the unit is positioned now to be profitable.\n\nNow, Barra has told investors, GM is working on a plan to restructure in South America to address financial struggles there.\n\nOne of those fixes might mean job cuts. In January, GM posted a message at Brazilian plants saying that after racking up heavy financial losses during the past three years there, GM faces “a critical moment that will require sacrifices from everyone,” according to Reuters.\n\nGM's warning surprised workers in Brazil, Reuters reported, because GM has surpassed Volkswagen and FCA in sales as Brazil's economy recovered. In fact, GM sold 690,000 vehicles in South America in 2018, up from 669,000 in 2017.\n\nSouth America \"is a weak point, but that market doesn't represent much anyhow,\" said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management investment adviser. \"When it comes to regional markets, they've gotten out of Europe, so it's about China and the U.S. They're the ones that will swing your profit either way.\"\n\nLast year, 27.7 million vehicles were sold in China and 17.3 million in the United States, said LMC Automotive's Schuster.\n\nThe latest question centers on whether GM will keep its Holden division in Australia, with sales continuing to fall. The brand's January sales dropped 27 percent to 4,167 from the year-ago period, and less than half the vehicles it sold in January 2015, according to CarsGuide.\n\nIn 2017, GM closed its local manufacturing facilities in Australia. Earlier this month, the Financial Review reported that U.K. independent distributor Inchcape had hired an accounting firm to analyze Holden's finances with the possibility of taking it over. Inchcape distributes for Subaru, Peugeot and Citroen brands in Australia.\n\nGM spokesman Pat Morrissey, said GM is working on a turnaround in Australia.\n\n“Under the leadership of Dave Buttner, who was appointed in August last year to lead Holden, we are turning around the Holden business, growing sales, re-engaging and re-energizing our distribution network and launching exciting vehicles like the all-new Acadia. We are fully focused on supporting Dave in building a strong Holden for the future, as it remains an important part of GM’s business.”\n\nPlant closure, job cuts\n\nSo far GM's global restructuring and moves to introduce redesigned product such as the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups have paid off with profits. Between 2013 and 2018, GM earned $36.5 billion from its continuing operations, a company financial spokesman said.\n\nThe company went on a hiring spurt for nearly five years, seeking people with new skills to develop automated and add electrified vehicles. It has hired 9,000 new people in the past 24 months alone.\n\nBut on Nov. 26, GM announced a further restructuring plan to indefinitely idle five plants in North America, and, with previously announced white-collar cuts, trim nearly 14,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its global workforce. Two of the plants are in Michigan: Detroit-Hamtramck and Warren Transmission. GM is discontinuing the sedans those plants build to focus on SUVs and pickups, which are in higher consumer demand.\n\nIt has also announced it would invest $36 million in its Lansing Delta Township plant for future SUV production. The plant builds the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse SUVs. GM is also putting $20 million into its Romulus propulsion plant to increase the plant’s capacity for future 10-speed transmission production.\n\nBarra backlash\n\nBarra and GM have endured intense criticism by President Donald Trump, unions and lawmakers for idling the plants.\n\nThe backlash by the UAW and Canada's union, Unifor, has been intense, with the unions demanding GM reverse its decision to idle the plants. The unions take issue with GM shifting product allocation, including the new Chevrolet Blazer SUV, to Mexico.\n\nBut Barra has held firm, indicating GM won't reverse its decision. And, in Feb. 6 earnings call with Wall Street analysts, Barra reiterated the importance to make such strategic moves while GM is profitable and in a position of strength.\n\n“We are committed to continuing to strengthen the core business as well as continue to accelerate our work to lead in the future of personal mobility,” Barra said. “We are repositioning the company from one that was trying to be all things to all people in all markets to a very strategic, agile and profitable company. We believe we’re in a very differentiated position than many other competitors in this industry.”\n\nGM's big bet\n\n\"Is Mary possibly making a mistake?\" asked analyst Keller. \"Sure, of course, but she has to have the flexibility to see that she's made a wrong turn and figure out how to adapt to it. That's what I see happening in this company — agility.\"\n\nAgility and leadership in what GM sees as the future: Robot cars and electrification. In October 2018, GM, with GM Cruise, its self-driving vehicle development arm, partnered with Honda to speed up the deployment of self-driving cars to major cities this year. Honda will contribute about $2 billion over 12 years to these goals. It will also finance a $750-million equity investment in Cruise, bringing its total commitment to the project to $2.75 billion.\n\nGM Cruise announced a deal with SoftBank Investments in June. That deal, combined with the Honda transaction, brings the post-money valuation of Cruise to $14.6 billion, Barra said during a press briefing late last year. Not bad, given that GM paid $1 billion to buy Cruise in 2016. It was a 40-person startup then. In 2018, it had 1,100 employees.\n\nToday, GM Cruise has about 180 electric Cruise AV cars. They still have operating controls, such as a steering wheel and brakes. They are being tested mostly in San Francisco, with a handful deployed in Milford and the Phoenix area.\n\nBarra has also talked about an \"all-EV future\" saying the company will bring to market 20 EVs by 2023. She has hinted that GM has even given some thought to an electric pickup one day, and the company is said to be in talks to invest in Michigan startup Rivian, an electric truck maker that won a $700-million investment from Amazon.\n\nIndeed, global EV sales are forecast to be 18 million by 2030, with China accounting for 7.5 million, said Tyson Jominy, managing director of the data and analytics consulting group at J.D. Power.\n\n\"It's a rapidly expanding number with China leading, followed by Europe and both are driven by regulations in those countries,\" Jominy said.\n\nIn the United States, Jominy said EV sales will increase by 100,000 vehicles each year through 2025, putting it at 700,000, only about 5 percent of the retail car market.\n\nAs to self-driving cars, by 2030 forecasters say there will be 4 million robot cars on the road in ride-sharing fleets, and personal ownership of such cars will start around that timeframe, said Jominy.\n\nEssentially, this global restructuring was to free up money for autonomous and electric vehicles in the future, said Schuster. It has made GM a bold and aggressive company, albeit at some painful prices for those who lost jobs in global restructuring or as GM restructures now in North America, he said.\n\n\"There's pain along the way, but they're doing what they can, knowing the future will be much different than what it is today,\" said Schuster. \"If the market gets there, the payoff is going to be high. I think GM sees the vision of what the future is ... but can they hold onto the current GM until we get there?\"\n\nContact Jamie L. LaReau: 313-222-2149 or jlareau@freepress.com.

Even so, investors are still debating whether Elon Musk's electric-vehicle maker remains overpriced.\n\nThe company's market capitalization has dropped 45% since hitting an all-time high of $1.5 trillion on December 17, erasing most of the gains the stock made after CEO Musk helped finance the election victory of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd yet Tesla TSLA.O continues to fetch a valuation far above those of the world’s biggest automotive and technology firms, judging by standard financial metrics. That’s because most investors and analysts have bought Musk’s pitch that the world’s most-valuable automaker isn’t really a car company at all, but rather an artificial-intelligence pioneer that will soon unleash a revolution in robotaxis and humanoid robots.\n\nTesla’s electric-vehicle business accounts for almost all of its revenue but less than a quarter of its stock-market value, according to a Reuters review of more than a dozen analyses by banks and investment firms. The bulk of its worth rests on hopes for autonomous vehicles Tesla hasn't yet delivered, despite Musk's promises in every year since 2016 that driverless Teslas would arrive no later than the following year.\n\nThe stock’s decline since December stems from falling vehicle sales and profits; protests of Musk’s political activity, including his mass firings of U.S. government workers as a senior Trump advisor; and investor worries that politics are distracting the world’s richest man from tending to his cash cow. Still, Tesla’s market capitalization remains up about $65 billion since the election – an amount higher than the entire value of General Motors GM.N.\n\nTesla’s total worth of $845 billion still tops the next nine most-valuable major automakers combined, which collectively sold about 44 million cars last year, compared to Tesla’s 1.8 million.\n\nInvestors have long bet on Musk’s visions of Tesla’s tomorrow rather than its profits today. But the widening gap between its real-world performance and analysts’ earnings estimates for unborn products has prompted some to warn of irrational exuberance.\n\nMore Tesla stock news: Musk loses billions as Tesla shares get hammered\n\n“For how much longer can the stock remain divorced from the fundamentals?” JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in January, after Tesla reported poor earnings and its first-ever annual vehicle-sales decline.\n\nTesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. In July, Musk said investors who don’t believe Tesla would “solve vehicle autonomy” should “sell their Tesla stock.”\n\nRobotaxi pivot\n\nTesla’s previous peak value of more than $1.2 trillion came in 2021, in response to concrete achievements. Soaring sales of its ground-breaking Model 3 and Model Y had proved that EVs could sell profitably in mass volumes. Musk vowed then that Tesla would produce even cheaper EVs and sell 20 million vehicles annually by 2030, nearly double what the world’s largest automaker, Toyota 7203.T, sells now.\n\nMusk, however, shifted from the mass-volume goal last year. In April, Reuters reported Tesla had killed a long-awaited, all-new $25,000 “Model 2” that investors had counted on to drive growth. Since then, Musk has pitched investors on Tesla’s robotaxi focus.\n\nThe pivot was persuasive: Tesla shares jumped 71% from last year’s low in April through the November election, even as its EV sales stalled and profits fell.\n\nThen the stock nearly doubled in the weeks after Trump’s election. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump and now serves as his top advisor on slashing government staff and regulations.\n\nMusk’s political clout has convinced bullish analysts that Trump will clear regulatory roadblocks to deploying a vast fleet of Tesla robotaxis. Tesla, however, already faces little oversight from many U.S. states, which control most autonomous-vehicle regulation. Texas, where Musk promises to launch fare-collecting robotaxis by June, has barred cities from regulating them.\n\n“There’s absolutely nothing stopping him from releasing this self-driving technology right now,” said Gordon Johnson, chief executive of investment-advisory firm GLJ Research, which recommends shorting Tesla’s stock. The tech isn’t road-ready, Johnson argues: “If he released it tomorrow, the jig would be up. These things would be wrecking across America.”\n\nTesla has faced lawsuits and federal investigations into accidents, including fatalities, involving the driver-assistance systems it has marketed as Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. The company warns consumers the systems don’t make its cars autonomous and require drivers to pay strict attention. Musk has long said Tesla’s technology will soon be safer than a human driver.\n\nFalling sales, rising competition\n\nThe automaker’s core EV business is struggling. The only vehicle Tesla has launched since the 2020 Model Y is the Cybertruck. The triangular pickup had sales of 38,965 units last year, Cox Automotive estimates, well below the 250,000 that Musk initially predicted Tesla would produce by 2025. Tesla has also cut prices on the now-aging models 3 and Y amid slowing electric-vehicle demand globally and rising competition, especially in China, where EVs start below $10,000.\n\nNew data also show sharp Tesla-sales declines this year in European markets following Musk’s embrace of far-right political movements there.\n\nTesla now faces headwinds from the president Musk helped elect. Trump, a frequent EV critic, has called for scrapping EV subsidies and policies that have added billions of dollars to Tesla’s bottom line. Musk has dismissed the impact on Tesla of losing subsidies, saying rivals would suffer more.\n\nWhen Tesla reported a 20% drop in annual operating profit in January, analysts on the earnings call asked no questions about Tesla’s financials or falling EV sales. They focused instead on Musk’s promises of “autonomous ride-hailing” in Austin, Texas, by June and a wider driverless-vehicle launch by year-end. Tesla shares rose 3% the next day.\n\nTesla still trades at huge premiums, as measured by forward price-to-earnings ratios. The measure is used by investors to judge whether stocks are fairly valued. A high ratio suggests shares might be overpriced.\n\nTesla’s forward PE ratio is more than nine times the average of the next 25 most-valuable automakers. It’s quadruple that of BYD 002594.SZ, the Chinese automaker that passed Tesla last year as the world’s top EV seller.\n\nUnlike Tesla, BYD also has a booming business in gas-electric hybrids, driving total 2024 sales to about 4.2 million units, more than double Tesla’s deliveries. Yet BYD’s market capitalization is less than a sixth of Tesla’s.\n\nTesla's forward PE ratio also is more than double or triple those of tech giants Nvidia NVDA.O, Apple AAPL.O, Meta Platforms META.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O and Microsoft MSFT.O — the other six high-flying stocks, along with Tesla, known as the Magnificent Seven.\n\nOptimistic models\n\nBulls discount standard financial metrics for judging Tesla's potential, arguing Musk is singularly capable of leading a transportation revolution. He has said robotaxis and robots will make Tesla the “most valuable company in the world by far.”\n\nBrian Mulberry, client-portfolio manager at Tesla investor Zacks Investment Management, said Musk “always pulls off the technology,” despite long-running concerns about his “mad-scientist personality.”\n\nMost analyst models reviewed by Reuters remain bullish.\n\nSuch models typically justify Tesla's market value by breaking it into several categories: Its auto business, including services such as EV charging (now 90% of revenue); its energy-generation and storage business (10% of revenue); and three embryonic businesses: robotaxis; licensing or subscriptions for self-driving technology; and Optimus humanoid robots. Three such models in January rated EV sales as a relatively minor factor in Tesla's expected growth.\n\nTruist Securities attributed just 9% of Tesla's value to car sales, 21% to driverless-tech services, 17% to robotaxis and 34% to robots.\n\nBank of America’s model attributes about half of Tesla’s value to robotaxis and 28% to self-driving software subscriptions.\n\nMorgan Stanley attributes 21% to robotaxis and 39% to subscriptions for autonomous-tech and other services.\n\nTesla investor Ark Investment Management projects the stock will hit $2,600 by 2029, with robotaxis accounting for 88% of the company's value. Ark forecasts Tesla could produce millions of robotaxis by then, generating about $760 billion in annual revenue. That would be more than Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue.\n\nTasha Keeney, Ark’s director of investment analysis and institutional strategies, said she believes Tesla will achieve such growth by slashing the cost-per-mile of ride-hailing, making human drivers obsolete.\n\n“It’s cheaper than driving your personal car,” she said. “Maybe people will stop even driving.”\n\nTesla tech 'does not work safely'\n\nTrump could potentially clear the path for driverless cars with no steering wheels or pedals because the federal government regulates the safety of vehicle designs. Musk last October unveiled a concept car with such a configuration, the two-door Cybercab, saying it would go into production in 2026.\n\nBut individual states govern autonomous-vehicle travel on public roads, limiting Trump’s influence. Some states, including Texas, have few rules. Tesla’s largest U.S. market, California, requires extensive driverless testing under state oversight before granting robotaxi permits.\n\nA Trump move to loosen robotaxi regulation could benefit all competitors, not just Tesla. The tiny U.S. robotaxi industry, for now, is dominated by Alphabet’s Waymo, which operates hundreds of driverless taxis in cities including Los Angeles and Phoenix.\n\nWaymo and most other autonomous-tech developers seek to ensure safety with many overlapping technologies, including artificial intelligence, radar and lidar. Tesla aims to develop much cheaper robotaxis by relying solely on cameras and AI.\n\nSome investors doubt Tesla has found a unique path to cut-rate robotaxis. Mark Spiegel, an investment manager at Stanphyl Capital Partners, is shorting Tesla’s stock, an investment that pays off if shares fall.\n\nTesla’s approach to robotaxis “does not work safely and never will without radar and lidar,” Spiegel said.\n\nAnd China's BYD said last month it would offer — for free, as a standard feature — a driver-assistance technology similar to the Full Self-Driving system that Tesla sells in China for more than $8,000.\n\n“BYD is telling you there’s no value in self-driving,” said Johnson, the GLJ Research analyst. “In fact, it’s so valueless that we’ll give it away.”\n\nReporting by Chris Kirkham.

It estimates that 416,000 vehicles may be affected. The agency did not say whether it was aware of any collisions, injuries, or fatalities associated with the issue.\n\nThe agency’s office of defects investigation has received 354 complaints alleging unexpected braking on 2021-22 Tesla Model 3s and Tesla Model Ys in the past nine months. The alleged braking occurs while using Autopilot, Tesla’s suite of driver-assist features, which allow the vehicle to brake and steer automatically. Tesla owners sometimes refer to the unexpected brake activation as “phantom braking.”\n\nNHTSA’s investigation focuses on Teslas produced since the automaker removed radar from most of its vehicles, choosing to rely exclusively on cameras for its driver-assist features. NHTSA is not investigating the Model X and Model S, which Tesla did not immediately remove radar from.\n\nOne person filing a complaint with NHTSA alleged that their new Tesla, which lacks radar, has more phantom braking issues than their previous Tesla, which had radar.\n\n“The new Model Y with vision only is unreliable and dangerous,” they wrote. “The vehicle will randomly brake with no traffic in broad daylight.”\n\nAnother person who filed a complaint alleged that the problem occurred more than 20 times while on a road trip from California to Colorado.\n\n“I believe this problem is extremely dangerous and have not turned on the autopilot features since October,” the person wrote.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe agency’s investigation is technically a “preliminary evaluation,” which can be a precursor to an automaker issuing a recall. NHTSA had opened a preliminary evaluation into Tesla’s Boombox feature last fall before the automaker issued a safety recall last month. (The feature was recalled because it could negatively impact the pedestrian warning system and make a crash more likely.)\n\nThe preliminary evaluation into the unexpected braking will “determine the scope and severity of the potential problem and to fully assess the potential safety-related issues,” according to NHTSA.\n\nTeslas has faced a string of recent recalls, including issues with a seat belt alert and its “full self-driving” software.\n\nElectric vehicles like Teslas can often be fixed through over-the-air software updates.

It was the same year that:\n\nMartha Stewart went to prison for lying about a stock trade.\n\nJustin Timberlake ripped Janet Jackson’s top, exposing her breast, during a Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nA U.S. report determined Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGoogle went public, making its founders instant billionaires.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons defeated the L.A. Lakers to win the NBA championship.\n\nMeanwhile, tech writers viewed the Escape SUV — a full hybrid that depended on a computer to balance power and acceleration and determine which motor to use — as a miracle that brought scientists and product engineers together to collaborate in a way never done before.\n\nA Fast Company magazine headline in October 2004 labeled the endeavor “the most complex project in Ford’s history — and maybe its most important product since the Model T.” So this fall, Ford is celebrating 20 years of producing cars that operate with one gas motor and one electric motor to burn the least fuel and travel the most miles.\n\nFord took a few years to bring its hybrid vehicles to market, following the path of the Honda Insight two-passenger subcompact liftback and the Toyota Prius four-door sedan. Ford took the lead in the U.S. with bigger vehicles for which it was known.\n\nMaverick, F-150 debut\n\nThe Escape SUV helped lay the groundwork for technology needed to build hybrid versions of the popular (and high-profit) F-150 pickup and the small Maverick hybrid pickup.\n\nIt is the hybrid lineup, in addition to gas and all-electric vehicles, that puts Ford in a unique market position now with so many consumer options.\n\n“We have record hybrid sales this year,” Erich Merkle, U.S. sales analyst for Ford, told me.\n\n“Back in the day, when we first introduced the Escape hybrid, we had an advertisement with Kermit the Frog. It was a green hybrid Escape. A lot of people won’t remember that, I don’t think.”\n\nWhile electric cars generate a lot of buzz, hybrid vehicles are the fastest-growing segment in the U.S. today.\n\n“As electric vehicles are becoming pretty mainstream, all of a sudden, hybrids are the norm. Going to a hybrid is almost more normal than gas. I think that’s going to be the trend we see over the next five years,” said Tim Hovik, owner of San Tan Ford in Gilbert, Arizona. “I’ve seen it. People thought they would make so few, sure that they’d never find one, that they would give up ahead of time. Now, the first thing they ask when they go to a dealership, whatever model vehicle they want, they want it in a hybrid.”\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nUnlike fully electric vehicles, hybrids eliminate range anxiety — the fear of running out of battery life without a charging station close by, said Thad Szott, co-owner of Szott Auto Group, which sells Ford, Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Toyota vehicles in White Lake, Highland Township, Holly, Waterford and New Hudson.\n\n“This massive EV push in the United States is still going against some pretty big headwinds,” Szott said. “As high profile as EV discussion is in the media and around the water cooler, consumers are doing more homework on the technology and they’re landing on the hybrid. These discussions weren’t going on 20 years ago. Not as many people were paying attention. And most people, today, have no idea Ford has been building hybrid cars for 20 years.”\n\nNo question, Honda and Toyota deserve credit for introducing consumers to the idea.\n\n“Everybody was trying to find some way to get onto the hybrid bandwagon,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions. “The Escape hybrid is finally coming into its own.”\n\nAnd this makes Ford nuts.\n\nGM exited hybrids, crosstown rival Ford didn’t\n\nFew people realize the Dearborn automaker has built (and sold) nearly 1.3 million hybrid vehicles in the U.S. over the past two decades.\n\n“People say, ‘Oh, Ford is switching to hybrids.' We never left hybrids,” said Ford spokesman Said Deep. “Our competitors don’t have the same option.”\n\nBy contrast, General Motors said in 2022 that it would not be selling hybrid vehicles after discontinuing the pioneering Chevrolet Volt in 2019. But by early this year, as EV sales fell below expectations, GM announced it would, in fact, develop hybrid vehicles to get back in the game.\n\nIt’s easy to see why.\n\nFord has seen its hybrid sales spike 49% from January through August compared with a year ago, Merkle said. “This year, Ford has sold 125,462 hybrid vehicles. For the industry, hybrid vehicles are up 35% through August.”\n\nEscape hybrid sales totaled 13,645 — up 8.4% from the same period last year. Ford’s share of the hybrid vehicle segment is 12.6% through August — up more than 1 full percentage point compared with the same period a year ago, Merkle said.\n\nLong trips, short trips? No problem\n\nMark Taylor, 70, of Clarkston, drove his plug-in 2024 Escape hybrid to Cheboygan without stress or concern about getting to his destination. If there’s not enough battery power, the vehicle automatically switches to the gas engine.\n\nHe charges his vehicle with a solar charger for free and drives 20 miles a day to work and home at no cost, Taylor said. “The car runs on all electricity for the first approximately 40 miles. It has a hybrid engine.”\n\nTaylor, a chemist who spent eight years as a robotics program director at Kettering University in Flint, retired from teaching chemistry and physics in Pontiac — while also coaching robotics and instructing tennis. Now Taylor teaches robotics part-time at Cranbrook and Birmingham schools.\n\n“I’m suggesting a car like this for my friends,” Taylor said.\n\nElectrification: ‘A cautionary tale’\n\nIncreasing electrification within propulsion systems takes time and is not a simple process, said Stephanie Brinley, associate director at S&P Global Mobility based in Southfield.\n\n“The industry as a whole, and Ford, have been working toward better fuel economy and lower emissions forever,” she said. “Hybrids are now 9% of the market and you look at how that evolution has taken us this long to get there. It should be a cautionary tale, that full battery electric will take some time.”\n\nFord goal: 'How to make it more affordable'\n\nConsumers may purchase six versions of the 2025 Escape with four different powertrains. An Escape starts at $27,995. The Escape hybrid begins at $32,490. An Escape plug-in hybrid starts at $38,400, Ford said. Taxes and fees are extra.\n\nThe Escape hybrid gets 42 mpg in the city and 39 mpg combined. The plug-in hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 37 miles of all-electric range and combined 101 MPGe, Ford said.\n\n“We were focused on getting the product right and then … how to make it more affordable for everyone by driving the cost down,” said Anand Sankran, of Farmington Hills, director of Ford’s Ion Park, which develops and prototypes batteries and cells. He has been with Ford for 33 years, working as a key team leader on the Escape hybrid — with responsibility for “high voltage subsystems and components.”\n\nAs an electrical engineer doing research, Sankran knew electrification would happen, the only question was when and at what scale, he said. “We fully developed our own hybrid technology.”\n\nThat vision has led to more than 2,800 patents and the ability to make everything in house, Sankran told me. \"We design and build our own batteries, design and build our own electric transmissions, made in Ford Rawsonville (components plant) and Ford Van Dyke (electric powertrain center)” in Michigan.\n\nToyota leads as Ford fights for market share\n\nFord could have done things more simply, Fast Company wrote at the time. “It might, for example, have bought part of Toyota’s hybrid system, as Nissan has done. But … the only Toyota patents that it licensed … were to avoid patent infringement.”\n\nNoted Deep: “As a normal course of business, we take precautions when made aware of potentially relevant intellectual property.”\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 hybrid SUV remains a top seller, with 111,526 sold through second quarter of this year. Its customer base continues to grow.\n\nThe Honda CR-V hybrid remains the top seller in the U.S., building on 2023 sales of 197,317. The Honda Accord was the hottest selling hybrid car with 96,323 the same year, according to Honda.\n\nAt Ford, the long-term strategy of the SUV built at the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky turned out to be key to big hybrid profits all these years later. The 2025 Escape hybrid is scheduled to arrive at dealerships in October.\n\n“Ford was smart to get involved 20 years ago,” said John McElroy, veteran industry analyst and host of the “Autoline After Hours” webcast and podcast. “It’s really paying off for them now.”\n\nPhoebe Wall Howard, a Free Press auto reporter for nearly seven years, now writes a column on car culture, consumer trends and life that will appear twice monthly on Freep.com and in print.

So, two years ago, it started GM Defense, a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nGM Defense is looking to use hydrogen fuel cells in unmanned submarines, create remote-controlled robots, and potentially a militarized version of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt car.\n\nIt is also poised to add hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to GM's coffers if it wins a U.S. Army contract for which it's a finalist.\n\nThe rebirth of defense\n\n“There are a range of things across our portfolio beyond just making vehicles that we’re looking to introduce to the military,\" said Albritton. \"That’s part of what I’ve been focusing on — to introduce those capabilities to the Department of Defense or other government agencies.\"\n\nGM is not new to the defense business. In World War I, GM made the trucks used in the U.S. military. In fact, GM operated a defense business until 2003, then sold it to General Dynamics.\n\nGM named Albritton, 53, as GM Defense president in November 2018. He is a graduate of the Naval Academy and he served as an officer in the Navy for 10 years. His job keeps him largely in Washington, D.C., visiting the Pentagon or the Capitol to meet with lawmakers to educate them on GM Defense.\n\nThe bulk of GM Defense's staff of 25 people work in southeast Michigan. They tap into the talents of GM's engineers and technology experts to find new ways to use lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, cybersecurity technology and autonomy for the military.\n\nNeither Ford Motor Co. or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has a similar business arm dedicated to the military. Both do general business with the government, including the military.\n\nFor example, in October, AM General, a manufacturer of light tactical vehicles, partnered with the Jeep brand to debut a light tactical concept vehicle at an annual U.S. Army exposition. The Jeep Gladiator Extreme Military-Grade Truck (XMT) is the first phase of the collaboration for a lightweight military truck. FCA said depending on the military’s interest in the Gladiator XMT, production could begin in the second half of 2020.\n\nCornerstone contract\n\nGM Defense got its first big shot at a new military contract in late 2018.\n\nThe U.S. Army sought bids for a prototype Infantry Squad Vehicle. It wanted an ultralight tactical vehicle, 5,000 pounds or less, that can be loaded under a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter or put in the back of a CH-47 Chinook helicopter and dropped into battle.\n\nGM's prototype is a modified version of GM's Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 midsize pickup. In fact, it’s 70% off-the-shelf parts, said Albritton. The 2.8-liter diesel vehicle can carry up to nine soldiers.\n\nFive companies, including the new GM Defense, responded with proposals to create the ultralight tactical vehicle. In June, the army named its three finalists:\n\nGM Defense\n\nOshkosh Defense and Flyer Defense\n\nScience Applications International Corp. and Polaris Government and Defense.\n\nAs a finalist, GM Defense won $1 million. The Army asked the finalists to create two more prototypes that it is currently testing. It is expected to name a winner in March, said Albritton.\n\n“If we win this program, the platform can be used for international sales to other military, other government agencies like Border Patrol, the Marine Corps, Air Force and Special Forces,\" said Albritton. “It would be a great cornerstone program for GM Defense entering back into the defense market and looking at ways to expand our footprint.\"\n\nGM can sell only to allied forces of the United States, but the Infantry Squad Vehicle can have \"different variations on this platform and that would be a totally different contract” with a new customer, Albritton said.\n\nGM and the military: New Jeep SUVs, including a military Gladiator, come at crucial time for FCA\n\nAn icon: A look at Jeep through the years\n\nAdd to GM's profits\n\nIf GM Defense wins the contract with the Army, it would be its biggest deal to date.\n\nIt would pay $155 million to GM Defense to build 2,065 Infantry Squad Vehicles over the next decade. GM Defense has a few small contracts now, most are of \"the R&D variety,\" and Albritton declined to offer any specifics.\n\nBut any money GM Defense brings in goes to GM's bottom line, Albritton said.\n\n“We will never be a $147 billion company, that’s not the idea of General Motors Defense,\" said Albritton. \"But it allows us to take advantage of these critical capabilities that we’ve got within this company and provide them in a different context with a totally different customer.\"\n\nAnd it helps GM pay for its research and development, he said.\n\n\"There are things the military has invested in that we can leverage some of their dollars to help with the developmental cost,\" said Albritton. \"Then, provide that capability back into the military.”\n\nRange of possibilities\n\nThe potential migration path for a vehicle like the Infantry Squad vehicle would be eventual electrification, said Albritton. The military will not be ready for a long time to move into full-electric on the battlefield, he said, because of restricted range, a lack of charging infrastructure and the lengthy time to recharge a battery.\n\n“But in the interim, having a hybridized solution of diesel and electric is definitely very feasible and a solution we’re already working on with the Chevy Bolt, but in a militarized sense,\" said Albritton.\n\nAs GM shortens charging time for lithium-ion batteries and makes advances in hydrogen fuel cells, either or both could replace the diesel engines to give it \"a totally different mission capability,\" Albritton said.\n\nThe advantages of electrification in the battlefield are:\n\nProvides more power on lighter platforms.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries offer power to operate laser weaponry and active protection systems on vehicles.\n\nThey are quiet for stealth during operations.\n\nElectric vehicles create a lower thermal watch field to avoid detection.\n\nBy adding telematics such as OnStar, military vehicles can access navigational information, secured communications, Bluetooth tracking and the vehicle's health for maintenance, all at the touch of a button.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells offer portable power, eliminating the need to bring a generator to battlefield to power a field hospital or command control center.\n\nFinally, hydrogen and oxygen could be used on an unmanned platform under the sea, said Albritton. That would allow the Navy's submarines to stay under the surface significantly longer than traditional diesel-hybrid vessels.\n\n\"Today, if it’s not a nuclear-powered submarine, diesel submarines, which there are plenty of them around the world, have to snorkel, they have to bring air in so they can charge the batteries and then the submarine submerges again,\" said Albritton. \"It’s less effective at completing its mission if the submarine has to keep re-emerging.\"\n\nA hydrogen fuel cell submarine could stay underwater for weeks at a time and be much less costly than a nuclear submarine, which can stay submerged for months.\n\nPartnering up\n\nAlbritton said his biggest challenge is bringing awareness to military leaders and members of Congress of what GM Defense is capable of offering.\n\n\"We have not been in this business for 16 years so it’s the reintroduction of our company into this marketplace,\" said Albritton.\n\nIf GM does not win the Infantry Squad Vehicle contract, Albritton said it will be disappointing, but he will press on.\n\n\"There are a number of other programs we are potentially competing for now. We’re partnering on a program called the robotic combat vehicle,\" said Albritton. \"It has a light, medium and heavy version. On the light and medium, we are looking to be a partner on some teams to compete for those two programs.”\n\nRCVs are remotely controlled robots that would give soldiers expanded capabilities, said Albritton. They would not be fully autonomous, but rather like a drone, which is piloted by a human.\n\nAs for full self-driving of military vehicles, GM Defense is not yet working with GM Cruise, GM's autonomous vehicle unit. Full autonomy remains a long way from the battlefield.\n\n\"The way companies are looking at full autonomy, where the car makes decisions on right turns, left turns, stopping and so on — in a military environment you don’t have stop signs, lanes or lines. You may not even have access to GPS,\" said Albritton.\n\nSo autonomous in the military will be used differently than how carmakers hope to use it on civilian streets one day.\n\nStill, said Albritton, \"The military is looking for solutions in those areas. There are companies that do those types of things and we’re working to see if we can play in that area or not.”\n\nContact Jamie L. LaReau: 313-222-2149 or jlareau@freepress.com.

The two adult giant pandas, Mei Xiang (female) and Tian Tian (male), and their cub Xiao Qi Ji (male) are returning to China by Dec. 7.\n\nAn agreement between the zoo and China Wildlife and Conservation Association brought the panda pair to the U.S. on December 6, 2000. The adult pandas were supposed to stay for a decade as part of a research and breeding agreement, but the program with China was extended several times.\n\nThe once-endangered species are now designated as \"vulnerable,\" following a population growth of nearly 17% between 2007 and 2017. The International Union for Conservation of Nature upgraded giant Pandas on the global list of species at risk of extinction, according the World Wildlife Fund. Only 1,864 wild pandas remain in the wild, mostly in China's Sichuan Province.\n\nHistory of giant pandas in US zoos\n\nOver 50 years ago, The National Zoo received its first pandas from China, Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, as an effort to save the species by breeding them. The Zoo's giant panda team works closely with colleagues in China to advance conservation efforts around the world, according to the zoo's conservation biology institute.\n\nMei Xiang has given birth to seven cubs while at the zoo. Four of her cubs are living, and three died before adulthood. As part of the agreement with China, cubs must be returned by age 4.\n\nWhen Mei Xiang gave birth to Xiao Qi Ji in August of 2020, she became the oldest giant panda to have a cub in North America.\n\nOnce the three giant pandas return to their homeland from Washington, D.C., only four giant pandas will be left in the U.S.: Lun Lun and Yang Yang, and their offspring Ya Lun and Xi Lun, all of which live at Zoo Atlanta.\n\nThe younger cubs at Zoo Atlanta are expected to travel to China in 2024, the zoo says. The adult pandas are expected to return as well, as there has been no discussion about extending the loan agreement instated in the mid-1990's, according to the zoo.\n\nThe Memphis Zoo returned their panda, Ya Ya, in April after a 20-year loan agreement with China ended, according to The Associated Press. Memphis and the San Diego Zoo, which sent two giant pandas to China in 2019, were the only other zoos in the U.S. to house pandas.\n\nFarewell Ya Ya: Giant panda returns to China after 20 years at Memphis Zoo\n\nA much-needed moment of pure joy: Giant panda at National Zoo gives birth to cub", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/26/san-diego-zoo-pandas-china/74217249007/", "title": "San Diego Zoo pandas arrive from China - USA Today", "text": "June 26, 2024 Updated June 28, 2024, 9:12 a.m. ET\n\nThe pandas are back.\n\nThe San Diego Zoo said Friday that two pandas safely arrived in the city after a journey from China.\n\nOfficials in China bid farewell Wednesday to the two Giant Pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, before the pair travelled to San Diego. They are the first pandas from China to arrive in the U.S. in 21 years, according to the San Diego Zoo.\n\nOne of the pandas, the nearly 5-year-old male Yun Chuan, is the son of a panda born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007.\n\nThe zoo first announced it would be getting more pandas from China in February, and officials said Wednesday the pair \"will travel to the San Diego Zoo soon after the farewell ceremony.\"\n\nIt will take some time for the pandas to settle in at the San Diego Zoo before visitors can see them in their zoo habitat, officials said. A wildlife care team that's closely monitoring Yun Chuan and Xin Bao will determine when they're ready to be introduced to the public, the zoo said Friday.\n\n\"After the pandas have safely arrived in San Diego, they will not be viewable to the public for several weeks while they acclimate to their new home,\" the zoo said in a news release.\n\nThe zoo said it will share a date for when the pandas can be viewed as soon as its available.\n\nGet to know Xin Bao and Yun Chuan\n\nNearly 4-year-old female Xin Bao's name means “new treasure of prosperity and abundance,” according to the San Diego Zoo.\n\n“Giant pandas often symbolize wildlife conservation, peace, and friendship, but her name also reminds us that in Chinese culture, pandas also symbolize blessings and success,” the zoo said earlier this year. “Her name will no doubt remind us that it’s an honor to play a part in her success and to help giant pandas thrive, both here and in China.\"\n\nThe zoo said she is very active, alert, witty and a superb climber. She’s playful and will sometimes roughhouse with other pandas.\n\nAccording to the zoo, guests may be able to spot Xin Bao pretty easily due to her large, round face and big ears that give her a unique look.\n\nYun Chuan whose name means \"cloud\" and \"big river,\" alluding to the place in China he's from − Sichuan, according to the San Diego Zoo.\n\nAltogether, his name means “big river of cloud,” a reminder of the “flowing clouds that often shroud the forests where giant pandas live in the mountains of southwestern China,” the zoo said.\n\nYun Chuan has familial ties to the San Diego Zoo. His maternal grandmother, Bai Yun, as well as his grandfather, Gao Gao, both stayed at the San Diego Zoo in the early 2000s. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the zoo in 2007.\n\n“Yun Chuan’s lineage has deep connections to the San Diego Zoo and we’re excited by the prospect of caring for them,\" Megan Owen, vice president of conservation science at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance said earlier this year.\n\nHow many pandas are coming to US zoos?\n\nFriday's announcement from the San Diego Zoo comes as zoo patrons across the country are celebrating the impending arrival of more of the black and white bears.\n\nIn May, the Smithsonian National Zoo said it will get one male and one female panda from China sometime before the end of 2024. The 2-year-old male, Bao Li, is the grandson of Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, the two pandas who left the National Zoo to return to China in November.

Preliminary work on that has already begun and engineers from the Beijing Zoo travelled to San Francisco to meet with officials of the zoo and assist in the preparations.\n\nWhy did pandas get removed from zoos in the US?\n\nZoos across the country returned their pandas last year because of the rocky relationship between the U.S. and China.\n\nThree beloved pandas, Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and Xiao QI Ji, were sent back to China from the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in November after attempts to renew a three-year agreement with China Wildlife Conservation Association failed.\n\nThe decision to return them came after Jinping, who called pandas \"envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples,\" met with Biden in November.\n\n\"I was told that many American people, especially children, were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas and went to the zoo to see them off,\" Xi said.\n\nMayor Breed sent a letter to Jinping in Feburary along with over 70 local Chinese and API community and merchant leaders and requested for San Francisco to receive the pandas.\n\nChina's history of loaning out pandas\n\nChina gifted the first panda to the U.S. in 1972 after President Richard Nixon formalized normal relations with China.

The statement also elaborated on routine health issues older pandas often face.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, pop megastar Billie Eilish supported In Defense of Animals' calling for the return of Memphis Zoo giant pandas to their native country of China.\n\nIn spite of Eilish's support becoming Twitter-official, some unknowns remain: It's unlikely that either pandas are suffering, given their status as assets on loan from the Chinese government. It's also unclear if Eilish has ever seen the pandas in person.\n\nFurther, it's not clear if those who have decried the treatment of the pandas are experts in the field of zoology or have previously cared for elderly giant pandas.\n\nNon-profit, informal organization allege serious health issues\n\nToward the end of 2020, photos of Ya Ya and Le Le began circulating throughout social media. To the average, non-expert gaze, the photos of both giant pandas could be seen as alarming: both appeared to have pinkish, raw skin in some parts of their bodies. Each appeared thin.\n\nAs the images began to circulate more, a Change.org petition advocating for Le Le and Ya Ya's return to China was launched. As of Tuesday, the petition has nearly 72,000 signatures.\n\nThe petition alleges that both pandas would be better off in their native country of China, where the bears are considered a point of national pride and where their food source — bamboo — grows in abundance.\n\nThe petition was established by pandavoices.org, a website with a singular focus on the Memphis giant pandas.\n\nThe Memphis Zoo responded to the growing criticism and sought to assure panda fans that Le Le and Ya Ya received thorough care and were both in good health.\n\nBut In Defense of Animals dismissed the zoo's attempts at assurance, and continued to describe both pandas as malnourished. The organization also maintains that Ya Ya has suffered from skin mites for the past several years.\n\nThe organization posted a statement from the Beijing Zoo and the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens that said the Memphis Zoo must \"address basic panda care such as feeding her bamboo shoots throughout the year and treating her Demodex mites.\"\n\nThe Commercial Appeal wasn't able to verify the authenticity of the statement posted by In Defense of Animals.\n\nWhether Eilish's support of organizations calling for the pandas' retirement will yield any action on the zoo's part remains to be seen.\n\nA ten-year contract that renewed the pandas' residency at the Memphis Zoo was re-signed in 2013. The Commercial Appeal asked the zoo if there are plans to renew the contract, but did not receive a response\n\nThe Memphis Zoo is one of three zoos in the U.S. that features giant pandas living in captivity; the National Zoo in Washington D.C. and Zoo Atlanta also have giant pandas.\n\nThe full statement from the zoo is as follows:\n\nThe Memphis Zoo would like to address the misinformation that has been distributed recently regarding the health and well-being of our Giant Pandas, Le Le and Ya Ya. These pandas have called the Memphis Zoo home since 2003. Our pandas have been the inspiration for multiple research studies regarding nutrition, reproduction, and forestry habitat restoration, all of which have contributed to the massive success of having the Giant Panda removed from the endangered species list. We are partnered with the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens (CAZG) who we are in constant communication with regarding the status of our pandas. We report to CAZG monthly sharing the status of husbandry, reproductive, and nutritional information for both bears. These reports include graphs of the pandas’ weights, amount of food consumed and defecated, as well as the enrichment they receive. Since their arrival in 2003, both our male and female pandas have had thorough annual physical examinations which have always consisted of extensive diagnostic testing in order to evaluate them internally as well as externally. These exams have also involved additional input by multiple experts in reproductive physiology, ultrasonography, and dentistry. Per the direction of the CAZG, during these annual exams we have collected semen from our male and performed artificial insemination on our female. As our bears have entered a geriatric phase of life, we have increased the number of physical exams conducted annually to reassure both our partners and the public that these bears are being vigilantly monitored. Through voluntary participation, known as operant conditioning, our bears have blood and urine samples examined monthly which are monitored for early indicators of infection or disease, as well as the appropriate functioning of their organ systems. These exams are done both proactively and for diagnostic purposes to ensure our bears are receiving exemplary care. In addition, there have been many concerns surrounding our female Giant Panda, Ya Ya. Despite annual attempts of natural breeding and artificial insemination as per recommendation and consultation with CAZG, this individual over the last 20 years has had minimal success conceiving and zero success maintaining a pregnancy. Regarding her stature, people have noted that she is a very small bear. Phenotypically speaking, this does not stem from her nutrition, but her familial genetics. In conclusion, Ya Ya also lives with a chronic skin and fur condition which is inherently related to her immune system and directly impacted by hormonal fluctuations. This condition does not affect her quality of life but does occasionally make her hair look thin and patchy. The condition is closely monitored by our animal care team and veterinary staff. With an active research team who is devoted to expanding the conservation impact of our zoo, they have developed methods for artificial insemination that allow for sperm to be frozen, transported across the world to China, then thawed to be evaluated and utilized for artificial insemination around the world. Our male Giant Panda, Le Le, has sired offspring through this process. Additionally, our teams have been a part of global restoration coalitions to restore forests for the natural populations of Giant Pandas. We are extremely proud of the work and dedication of our animal care teams, veterinary staff, and research teams. They are devoted to global conservation as well as the animals in their care. We are incredibly grateful to our loyal zoo supporters who have followed Le Le and Ya Ya’s lives over the last two decades. We encourage anyone who wants to learn more about our bears and our mission as a zoo to come visit us.\n\nMicaela Watts is a reporter for The Commercial Appeal and can be reached at micaela.watts@commercialappeal.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/21/giant-pandas-debut-washington-national-zoo/77744406007/", "title": "Giant pandas to debut at National Zoo in Washington - USA Today", "text": "Updated Jan. 21, 2025, 1:02 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – Panda-monium has returned to the nation's capital.\n\nAfter more than a year without their popular giant pandas, the Smithsonian's National Zoo is set to debut its two latest black-and-white bears to the enamored masses on Friday.\n\nPanda fans will be able to catch a glimpse of the newcomers, Bao Li and Qing Bao, and enjoy a slate of festivities planned to commemorate the bears' public unveiling.\n\nOn a 10-year loan from China, the pair took the transpacific flight to Washington in November and have since settled into their new home. They replaced three bears – Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji – who returned to China at the expiration of their lease in November 2023.\n\nFor the last two months, the zoo has been gearing up for the thousands of people they expect to brave the cold to gaze at the newest panda ambassadors.\n\nHere's what you need to know before visiting Bao Li and Qing Bao:\n\nHow do I get a ticket to see the pandas?\n\nEntry into the National Zoo is free and no additional tickets are required to enter the panda habitat.\n\nThose wishing to see Bao Li and Qing Bao can secure passes online at nationalzoo.si.edu/visit/events. A limited number of same-day passes may be offered at the entrances for those without access to the zoo's website.\n\nThe National Zoo, 3001 Connecticut Ave. NW, is open every day except Christmas from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. (last admittance into the park is at 3 p.m.).\n\nOnce inside, panda-seeking guests will be directed to the Asia Trail and David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat, which has been renovated with shallow pools, bamboo stands for foraging and multilevel climbing structures, the zoo said in a statement.\n\nHow do I get to the National Zoo?\n\nThe National Zoo is conveniently located near several Metrorail and bus stops and offers paid parking on-site.\n\nParking passes can be purchased online for $30 at nationalzoo.si.edu/events. The zoo recommends parties reserve their passes a few days before their visit.\n\nThe zoo is located near two Red Line Metro stations, Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan and Cleveland Park. The latter station is recommended for those with mobility issues as it's not as uphill from the zoo as the Woodley Park stop. The L2 bus stops in front of the facility's main entrance on Connecticut Avenue.\n\nWhat is the 'District of Panda Party'?\n\nTo commemorate Bao Li and Qing Bao's debut, the zoo is hosting two weeks of celebrations and special events it has dubbed the \"District of Panda Party.\"\n\nThe festivities, which will run from Jan. 25 to Feb. 9, include a host of events and programs, including a Lunar New Year event, a film screening of \"King Fu Panda\" and a slate of cultural activities put on by the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China, the zoo has said in a statement.\n\nThose wishing to attend the multiday celebration need only reserve park entry passes (again, entrance tickets are free).\n\nAlong with the festivities, the Smithsonian is selling limited edition merchandise commemorating the debut of Bao Li and Qing Bao. The proceeds will go to support the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute’s animal care and conservation programs, the zoo said in a statement.\n\nHow to tell the panda bears apart\n\nGazing at the pandas, visitors at the National Zoo may wish to discern who is who. Here are some things to look out for.\n\nQing Bao has two distinctive “birthmarks” on her backside, which appear as dark patches on her left hip, according to the National Zoo website.\n\nQing Bao's cheeks are also fluffier than Bao Li's. And while you're looking at their adorable faces, pay attention to their black eye patches. The blotch of black fur around Bao Li's eyes is wider, with pointy tips that flare out more than Qing Bao's.\n\nAnother clue lies in the band of black fur that runs across their front legs and their backs. Bao Li's band is thicker than Qing Bao's and it pinches in the middle.\n\nTheir distinctive personalities are another likely giveaway. Bao Li has gained a reputation among zookeepers as the more outgoing, playful and vocal of the two bears. Panda expert Mariel Lally in an interview for the zoo's website said, \"If you hear a panda vocalizing to a keeper, that’s probably Bao Li.\"\n\nQing Bao is more independent and reserved, according to zoo staff.

Tune in to the 'Giant Panda Cam'\n\nThose who can't make the trip to Washington can still watch the young bears via the \"Giant Panda Cam,\" a live broadcast designed to give enthusiasts a look at what Qing Bao and Bao Li are up to on any given day.\n\nThe panda reality show of sorts is pulled together from 40 cameras placed throughout their enclosures. The cameras will be operated by trained volunteers from a central system and run from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Once the day is over, the recordings will be rebroadcast so \"virtual visitors around the world can view the animals when they are most active,\" the zoo said in a statement.\n\nThe \"Giant Panda Cam\" launched in 2011 and has garnered more than 100 million page views.

But on Wednesday morning, zoo visitors learned they have something big (and furry) to look forward to again.\n\nThe zoo said Wednesday that it's set to receive male panda Bao Li and female panda Qing Bao, both 2 years old, from China sometime in 2024.\n\nThe news comes after Mei Xiang and Tian Tian − who had been in the U.S. for 23 years − and Xiao Qi Ji, who was born in August 2020, returned to China in November following a bittersweet farewell in Washington.\n\nZoo staff put up new banners Wednesday letting visitors know, \"the pandas are coming.\"\n\nFlanked by stalks of bamboo on the zoo’s Asia Trail, local graduate student Summer Zhou said the environment felt ready for the panda’s return.\n\n“I just feel like their spirit is still here,” she said. “They never left my heart.”\n\nFamilies rolled strollers beneath the decorations as they walked through the zoo's entrance. Teresa Willibey, 30, was among them with her 4-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, visiting from Buffalo, New York.\n\n“It’s exciting for my kids to get to see them so they can learn more about other animals,” said the former Washington resident.\n\nThe two new giant pandas will replace the trio that came before them beginning sometime before the end of 2024, said Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in a social media video announcing the news.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to announce that within this year we'll once again welcome a new pair of giant pandas,\" Bunch said.\n\nOne of the new pandas is closely related to the pair that just left the zoo, officials said Wednesday.\n\nWho are Bao Li and Qing Bao, the new pandas?\n\nBao Li is the grandson of Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, the pandas who returned to China in November. Bao Li's mother is Bao Bao, the pair's second offspring, born in 2013 at the National Zoo.\n\nBao Li means \"treasure\" and \"energetic\" in Mandarin Chinese, according to the zoo.\n\nQing Bao means \"green\" and \"treasure,\" the zoo said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThe zoo also said a new 10-year research and breeding agreement has been signed with China.\n\nHow long have pandas been at the National Zoo?\n\nThe first panda came to the U.S. from China in 1972, and the fluffy animals have been a staple of Washington's Smithsonian National Zoo ever since.\n\nThe zoo's previous pandas Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and Xiao Qi Ji returned to China last year after attempts to renew the Smithsonian's 3-year agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association failed.\n\nWednesday's announcement follows increased engagement between Washington and Beijing which has put ties on a steadier footing since relations hit historic lows last year.\n\nChina's ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said the new panda cooperation agreement was “a very good sign” for U.S.-China relations.\n\n\"To deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples, today I am very glad to share with you some good news,\" he said during remarks at the zoo.\n\nWashington is not the only city that will soon be home to the pandas.\n\nZoos in California announced earlier this year they would also continue to benefit from the more than 50 years of diplomacy surrounding the giant pandas.\n\nIn February, the San Diego Zoo announced it will be getting a new pair of pandas, Xin Bao and Yun Chuan. In April, the San Francisco Zoo said it will host pandas again for the first time since 1985. Timelines for both zoos have not yet been announced.\n\nThe latest example of 'panda diplomacy'\n\nIn 1972, China gifted the first panda to the U.S. after President Richard Nixon formalized normal relations with China. Since then China has loaned pandas to other foreign zoos in hopes that it will build ties with those countries.\n\nThe practice has been dubbed \"panda diplomacy.\"\n\nBarbara Bodine, director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University and a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen with more than 30 years’ experience in U.S. foreign service, said the the bears are “probably the most successful soft diplomacy animals any nation has ever come up with.\"\n\nBodine doesn't think the panda moves reveal too much about the current relationship between the U.S. and China, which is certainly strained. But the attention does show how effective the bears are at generating a “warm, fuzzy feeling.\"\n\nBodine hopes the pandas are greeted with this optimistic spirit: “The children of America thank you, and the pandas are a wonderful representation of the Chinese people and their culture.”\n\nNews of pandas' arrival sparks excitement in Washington\n\nChildren, filled with excitement, shouted the names of their favorite animals as they ventured through the zoo's entrance on Wednesday morning.\n\n“Can I see the panda?” one young visitor asked her parents.\n\nEven though Willibey's family had already left the Washington area, they were still sad to see the black and white bears go last year.\n\n“It worked out that we weren't affected too much, but we were bummed that it was happening in general,” she said.\n\nAlthough her kids shouted in excitement about the pandas, Willibey expressed a note of concern. “I feel kind of mixed,” she said. “It's exciting that it's coming back… but at the same time, maybe it should be growing up where it's supposed to come from.”\n\nTo Eric Williams, a longtime Washington resident, and his 7-year-old daughter, the loss of the pandas deprived the zoo of one of its main attractions.\n\n“It kind of took away from a big part of coming here,” Williams, 50, said as he shepherded his daughter and her first grade classmates past the otter exhibit. “My kids have always enjoyed seeing them.”\n\nWilliams isn’t a frequent zoo visitor, but he returned on Wednesday morning to accompany the class on a school field trip.\n\nThe kids also had the pandas on their minds. “Actually, on the ride here, they were asking about them,” Williams said. “Whether they were going to get the opportunity to see the pandas.”\n\nWilliams’ message about the return of the pandas – the more, the merrier.\n\n“Probably need a little more,” he said. “I’d say minimum, five or six. Give everybody an opportunity to see them.”\n\nGrad student Zhou said she can hardly wait for the pandas to return – the zoo just isn’t the same to her without them.\n\n“It definitely feels like a missing component of the zoo,” said Zhou, a 25-year-old graduate student studying sustainability at American University in Washington's Tenleytown neighborhood, just north of the zoo.\n\nZhou, originally from Texas, traveled the short distance from her home with a fellow grad student on Wednesday morning to get up close with the animals.\n\nVideos she captured of the pandas last summer are more than just a memento to Zhou – they’re a life lesson.\n\n“When I watch them, I get relaxed too,” she said. “They’re like these big, fluffy animals who know how to enjoy life.”\n\nContributing: Julia Gomez, Saman Shafiq, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/16/pandas-could-return-to-us-xi-jinping/71603462007/", "title": "Pandas may return to California, China President Xi Jinping says", "text": "Updated Nov. 16, 2023, 1:36 p.m. ET\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – Panda enthusiasts, get ready to bearly contain your excitement: Just days after the nation's capital bid a teary farewell to its beloved trio, China's president signaled more of the fuzzy creatures might be headed to the U.S. in the future.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping called pandas \"envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples\" during a speech with business leaders on Wednesday, after the three pandas at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C.. were returned to China.\n\n\"I was told that many American people, especially children, were really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas and went to the zoo to see them off,\" Xi said.\n\nHe suggested the pandas might be sent to California and said he learned the San Diego Zoo and Californians \"very much look forward to welcoming pandas back.\"\n\nThe U.S. would welcome the return of pandas, according to John Kirby, a White House spokesperson on national security.

Pandas have been in the country since 1972, after former President Richard Nixon normalized relations with China, a gift that some dubbed \"panda diplomacy.\" But China's gradual pulling of pandas from Western nations is considered the result as a sign of declining relations with the U.S. and other countries, the Associated Press has reported.

For the next 10 years, the pair will be on loan in the U.S. as part of an agreement announced earlier this year.\n\nHere's what to know about giant pandas − and maybe what you didn't know:\n\nBao Li has deep ties to Washington\n\nBao Li was born in China, but he'll be the third generation from his family to live in Washington. Bao Li's mother is Bao Bao, who was born at the National Zoo in 2013 and returned to China in 2017.\n\nAnd Bao Li's grandparents, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, lived in D.C. for over two decades before being sent back to China last November. The previous panda residents and stars of the National Zoo returned after attempts to renew an agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association failed. They first arrived in the U.S. in 2000.\n\n“Bao Li has a huge personality. He reminds me a lot of his grandfather, Tian Tian,” National Zoo panda keeper Mariel Lally, told CNN.\n\nPandas can bite like a carnivore\n\nThough pandas are known for munching on bamboo all day long, they have one of the strongest bite forces of any carnivore. Pandas rank behind only lions, brown bears, tigers and polar bears for their bite force.\n\nBamboo is a tough plant, so pandas have huge jaw muscles that can deliver a seriously powerful bite, according to Zoo Atlanta. When pandas chew on bamboo, you can see their ears wiggling and their eyes moving. That's because their jaw muscles stretch all the way up their heads.\n\nWhat do pandas do all day? Eat, mostly\n\nBamboo makes up about 99% of a panda's diet, and they spend a lot of time eating it – somewhere from 10 to 14 hours per day, according to the San Diego Zoo.\n\nThey're not that good at digesting the bamboo, and most of what they eat becomes waste. They are very good at ingesting it, however. Pandas have even developed a \"pseudo thumb,\" a bone that protrudes from their paw, so they can grasp bamboo, said David Kersey, a professor at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Western University of Health Sciences and an expert in the reproductive physiology of pandas. It's a sixth digit but not a true thumb, Kersey said.\n\nTo get all their nutrients, they have to eat huge amounts. They eat 70 to 100 pounds of bamboo each day, the National Zoo said. The zoo also feeds them nutritious biscuits, carrots, sweet potatoes and apples.\n\nMei Xiang and Tian Tian, the pandas who along with their cub Xiao Qi Ji were returned to China last year, loved eating apple juice-flavored \"fruitsicles\" as a treat, the National Zoo said. Xiao Qi Ji liked grape flavor.\n\nScientists are still figuring out how to get pandas to mate naturally in zoos\n\nThough pandas have been having cubs in zoos in the U.S. for the last couple decades, it's extremely rare for a female panda in captivity to become pregnant naturally as they would in the wild, Kersey said. In fact, pandas at the National Zoo have never successfully mated naturally; all panda births have been the result of artificial insemination, according to the zoo.\n\nGiant pandas are fertile for only about three days each year. In the wild, when a female panda is approaching those days, she uses scent marking and calls like bleating, chirping and barking to alert males to where she is. She'll attract multiple males, and their instinct is to fight each other over her.\n\nIn captivity, Kersey said, the males don't let go of that aggressive instinct, and often become aggressive toward the female when there aren't any other males to fight. In the early 2000s, zoos in the U.S. developed a technique to artificially inseminate pandas instead. The method has been adopted in China as well.\n\nIt was a “monumental success story,\" Kersey said. \"It still doesn’t solve the problem of natural mating (in captivity). But it allowed us to grow the captive population.\"\n\nThat means there are enough pandas in captivity to potentially begin reintroducing them into their natural habitats, he said.\n\nPandas aren't endangered anymore − but still at risk\n\nAs of 2021, giant pandas are no longer considered endangered in China, the nation's officials announced. The population of pandas in the country increased to over 1,800, so they are considered \"vulnerable,\" rather than endangered, China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said at the time.\n\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature removed pandas from its endangered list in 2016, but Chinese officials rejected the determination for several more years. The IUCN first considered them endangered in 1990 and said when it downgraded their status to vulnerable that their population appeared to be increasing because of conservation efforts and reforestation.\n\nChina had also spent decades trying to put an end to poaching. Climate change also threatens their habitats, according to the National Zoo.\n\n\"Scientists and conservationists have worked to restore the giant panda’s habitat and increase breeding in human care,\" the National Zoo said.\n\nContributing: Jorge L.

The scene struck her deeply, resurfacing memories of when she was separated from her parents during the Vietnam War. From that moment, Nguyen said, she has been caught in a kind of loving bear trap.\n\nShe bought a professional-grade camera to document the animals, her first foray into photography. The shy federal employee started the conservation group “Pandas Unlimited,” which introduced her to many of her closest friends. But the pandas went on to occupy an even bigger role in her life: They became matchmakers.\n\nShe met her husband, Foo Cheung, in front of the zoo’s panda habitat after Cheung, a scientist who dabbled in animal photography, joined the group Nguyen had started. They married two years later and went on to have two children – both named after the bears that brought them together.\n\nNow, after more than a year without seeing her favorite animals, Nguyen – along with countless panda fanatics – is ready to welcome Bao Li and Qing Bao, the latest bears loaned by China as part of its decades-long \"panda diplomacy” program. The bears made their public debut Friday.\n\nMore: How to see the National Zoo's new giant pandas\n\n“This is a new era,” Nguyen, 51, said. “I get to start early and watch them grow. My children get to see them grow, too.”\n\nThe 3-year-old pandas arrived in Washington in October after a 19-hour flight aboard the \"FedEx Panda Express\" from Chengdu, in China’s Sichuan province. They replaced three pandas – Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji – who returned to China when their lease expired in November 2023.\n\nIt was the first time the National Zoo had been without giant pandas since 1972 when the first panda ambassadors arrived in Washington following a historic visit to China by then-President Richard Nixon.\n\nAmid tenuous diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China, many feared giant pandas might not return to Washington, but a new agreement came together in a matter of months.\n\nThe Smithsonian’s National Zoo has since prepared for the resurgence of panda mania in the capital city, recruiting staff and volunteers including those involved in its wildly popular “Giant Panda Cam.”\n\nLast year, the zoo saw a 20% drop in visitors, which it attributes, in part, to the departure of its giant pandas in late 2023. Since the announcement of Bao Li and Qing Bao's arrival, the zoo has gained more than 1,000 new members. Many bought memberships to attend a series of preview events where they could see the pandas before Jan. 24 – an offering that helped acclimate the bears to crowds of adoring fans before their debut.\n\nTheir official unveiling on Friday marks not only the continuation of a special brand of U.S.-China diplomacy but also the pandas' enduring popularity in Washington, where their images are sold on T-shirts, emblazoned on public transit cards and painted on murals.\n\n“They’re just something everyone in D.C. can agree on loving,” said Liz Charboneau, a longtime zoo patron who has lived in Washington for 10 years. “They’re a bright spot for the city.”\n\n'Exactly what I hoped for': New pandas debut to the public\n\nA small group of panda devotees braved the freezing temperatures on Friday to be among the first to see the bears on the morning of their gala debut. Some traveled from hundreds of miles away.\n\nLisa Barham, 46, and her son Jayden, 5, drove from Cleveland, Ohio, to Washington for the event. They secured one of the first spots in line around 5:30 a.m.\n\n“It’s just adorable,” Barham said as she watched Bao Li munch on a pawful of bamboo. She first visited the National Zoo in 2013 when Bao Li’s mother, Bao Bao, was born. Friday’s event, she said, presented the perfect opportunity for their children to meet.\n\n“I got to see Bao Bao and here is the new generation,” she said. “This time I got to bring my little boy so this is exactly what I hoped for.”\n\nMarta Diaz, 32, flew from Puerto Rico so she could walk through the gates of the zoo’s Asia Trail just as it opened. As she turned one of the first corners, she caught sight of Qing Bao pacing around the snow-laden field.\n\n“I love them so much,” she said as she stood on her toes, trying to get a better view over other people at the railing.\n\nThe National Zoo and its pandas occupy a special place in Diaz’s heart. The giant bears were the favorite animal of her sister, Venus, who died from cancer in 2003. Since then, Diaz's affection for pandas has steadily grown, which she credits to their irresistible \"cuteness\" and how they remind her of her older sister.\n\n“They're just like her – the way they lay around and don’t like to do too much,” Diaz laughed. “That’s how she was.”\n\n'Awe-inspiring': Museum members get an early look at the new pandas\n\nAhead of the public debut, some museum members had a chance to see them early.\n\nAnne Bossi, a New Jersey resident who for decades has visited the zoo at least four times a year, was on her computer the moment early tickets went live.\n\nThe 72-year-old secured eight passes, and with a group of relatives stood in front of the furry animals, switching between waving \"hello\" and taking dozens of photos and videos.\n\nThere was plenty to see: Bao Li scarfed down bamboo and played with an inner tube, keeping it in the air with his front and back legs. Then he rolled around in the snow.\n\n“I haven’t been to the zoo in probably over 40 years, and to see them up close – it was pretty awe-inspiring,” said Lynn Kinsel, Bossi’s niece. “They were almost putting on a show for us.”\n\nQing Bao, known among zookeepers as a shy and contemplative panda, spent time on her climbing gym before sitting down to enjoy the bamboo special.\n\n“We had a 9:30 time slot, so I guess it was breakfast time,” Kinsel, 59, said.\n\nCharboneau, who purchased a membership to see the pandas early, caught Bao Li and Qing Bao while they were napping.\n\n“They were both asleep,” she laughed. “I really missed out because everybody else I know – and all the other pictures I saw from that day – showed them playing.”\n\nCharboneau, Kinsel and Bossi, like the countless panda fans around the world, are drawn to the bears' seemingly infinite charm – an aspect of the animals that still enthralls zoo officials.\n\n\"I've been working with these animals for 16 years, and I still want to stop and marvel at the extreme cuteness of these animals,\" said Brandie Smith, the director of the National Zoo, during an appearance on the USA TODAY podcast \"The Excerpt.\"\n\nSmith said being in the presence of a giant panda is a rare opportunity. The only other place in the U.S. where people can see the black-and-white bears outside of Washington is the San Diego Zoo. Within the last decade, the once-endangered species have been reclassified from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable.\"\n\n\"They're not just rare in the wild, but they're rare in zoos,\" Smith said. \"When you see one, that's a special opportunity. Most people on the planet won't have an opportunity to see a giant panda.\"\n\nNew pandas stir familiar feelings\n\nNguyen was among the panda devotees who got an early look at the new bears. To her, it was like reconnecting with old friends – especially since one of the pandas has deep ties to Washington.\n\nBao Li, born in China, is the third generation of his panda family to live in the nation’s capital. His mother, Bao Bao, was born at the zoo in 2013. His grandparents, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, called the National Zoo home for over two decades before they were sent back to China in November 2023.\n\nIt was these bears as well as their cub, Tai Shan, that sparked Nguyen’s enduring fascination with giant pandas.\n\n\"Watching these animals interact, it just filled me in ways that I didn't understand,\" she said. \"Being there made me smile. Made me laugh. It was such a happy place.\"\n\nNguyen began spending most weekends at the zoo, arriving as soon as the gates opened and staying until closing time, filling up hard drives with thousands of pictures and videos of Tai Shan and his parents. She felt a kinship with the animals and felt it was her duty to document their lives.\n\nWhen Tai Shan was sent to China and separated from his parents, Nguyen was heartbroken.\n\n\"We were crying,\" she said, recalling the snowy day in February 2009 when he was placed into a crate and taken out of the National Zoo. \"It was so sad ... he was like our first panda.\"\n\nShe felt similar anguish when Tai Shan's parents went back to China in November 2023.\n\nOver the past year, she still visited the zoo often, stopping by the empty panda habitat where she would reflect on the countless hours she spent there and hope for the pandas' eventual return. It didn't take long for her prayers to be answered.\n\nWhen she attended the member preview on Jan. 10 and saw Bao Li slide on his belly in the snow, it felt like a piece of her heart was restored.\n\n“Words can’t describe how happy I was,” she said. “It was that old feeling. And then going in with my husband – to the place where we met – it was just so special.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/02/giant-pandas-return-dc-the-excerpt/74646399007/", "title": "Giant pandas return to nation's capital by end of year | The Excerpt", "text": "Aug. 2, 2024, 11:14 a.m. ET\n\nOn a special episode (first released on July 31, 2024) of The Excerpt podcast: What does it take to be a successful international diplomat?

I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Wednesday, July 31st, 2024, and this is a special episode of the Excerpt. What does it take to be a successful international diplomat? For some, the secret is a distinctive coat of black and white fur and a love of bamboo. The China Wildlife Conservation Association and the Smithsonian National Zoo have reached a ten-year agreement that will bring two new giant pandas to the US by the end of the year. The announcement came just six months following the departure of their last two pandas. What do we know so far about this latest installment of panda diplomacy? We're joined now by National Zoo Director, Brandi Smith. Thanks for joining us Brandi.\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nSure. Thank you so much for having me.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nFirst, can you introduce our audience to the two new pandas that will soon be headed to DC? Who are we getting?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nWe have two young pandas that are coming here. Bao Li, who is a young male, and a lot of people are especially excited about him because he is the son of Bao Bao, who is one of the pandas who was born here at the National Zoo. Jing Bao is our young female giant panda.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nPandas are known for having very distinct and often engaging personalities. What do we know about these two so far?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nThey are very different. We know that Bao Li is very adventurous. He's very athletic. He's definitely going to be handful for us. A typical, I don't know, just kind of like a playful young boy and Jing Bao is a lot more thoughtful, I guess, so she is a little more calm, a little more thoughtful, a little more deliberate. One of my favorite things is we have keepers who have visited China, so veterinarian and the keeper who's visited China to start to get to know these giant pandas. We're finding out a lot about these animals, about their personalities, so we can make sure that we are ready to welcome them in the best way possible.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAs you know, back in the eighties, New York City mayor Ed Koch was successful in lobbying to bring pandas to the Bronx Zoo for a six-month stay. Who determined which zoo these new pandas would call home for the next 10 years? What can you share about that process?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nWell, we have a deep history with giant pandas. They first came here in the 1970s after a visit from President Nixon then. His wife, pat Nixon, very famously was the person who facilitated the discussions on giant pandas and welcomed them here, and they were a state gift at that time. Things are a little different now because now what we enter into is a conservation and research agreement. We essentially, based upon our history, based upon our long-term collegial relationship with our colleagues in China, we put together essentially a research, a breeding, a sustainability plan and work together to benefit the conservation of the species.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nI did want to ask about the history of panda diplomacy and what China aims to achieve through the practice, and then with it being a gift, as you said, or partnership, does it come at a cost?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nBringing pandas here, yes, of course. We want everybody to love pandas. We want everyone to see pandas and to take the species and conservation in general into their heart. Ultimately, the reason why we bring pandas here is because it enhances the conservation of the species in the wild. The agreement includes a fee that money that goes back to China directly to benefit to focus on the conservation of the species.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nPandas have now gone from being an endangered species to being a vulnerable species. Is there a chance that these two new pandas will reproduce while they're at the National Zoo? Is that part of the hope here?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nIt is, and these pandas were specifically selected because they are the best kind of genetic match for each other. When they come here, ideally, there'll be a compatible behaviorally as well, and they will breed and they will produce more pandas because ultimately the problem with endangered species is there aren't enough of them, and so the goal is always to make more. There are probably only about 1,800 giant pandas left in the wild. By producing more pandas, our goal is to eventually increase the number, not just in zoos, but pandas in the wild in general.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWhat are some of the considerations in the long-term care of these animals and their potential offsprings? I do understand that newborn pandas are quite fragile.\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nWell, they are very fragile, but the great thing is giant panda moms, they're really good moms. Our experience has been that the pandas are born entirely dependent upon their mothers, but our job is just to take care of the mothers so that then she can take care of her offspring. You said it earlier, a lot of people look at pandas and they don't realize how unique and distinct they are, not just as a species, but as individual animals from each other. When you take care of pandas, a lot of it is really understanding the individual giant pandas and then making sure that you are working to take care of their needs. You take care of their health, their nutrition. You make sure they're physically, intellectually stimulated, but then also, understanding them as individuals and working with them that way.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWay, unfortunately, we won't get to keep them. Does traveling from China to the US and back take a physical and emotional toll on pandas? How have you balanced the ethical considerations here?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nPandas travel in ultimate luxury. Before the pandas will travel, they travel in crates. These big crates that the pandas go into, we start training them to go into these crates well before, well before the transport happens. We make it a happy place. Actually, when we were training our pandas to return to China, we had a problem because they would just want to spend all day sitting in their crate eating bamboo. We create their crates are this happy little nook, and think of pandas, right? They'll spend time in dens and caves, in tree hollows. A small space to a panda is a safe space, and we make this happy, small, safe space. When they travel, they get their own flight. FedEx donates all of their expertise to us, and these pandas travel exclusively on their own jet with a veterinarian, with their keepers, with their favorite foods, with their favorite toys.\n\nWith giant pandas, in terms of the transit, it's nothing but a positive experience for them. What we try to do though is they're going to a different place. Different sites, different sounds, different smells. We work very hard with the keepers in China and vice versa, if the pandas are going from here to China, to make sure that we're prepared to meet those needs. For example, when the pandas come here, our keepers will travel to China in advance to spend time with the pandas there, so they're familiar faces, voices, sounds. Then when the pandas come here, we will have keepers from China who are here then to do a handoff, so it's a soft transition from one place to the next.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWhat can you share about the team that will be caring for the pandas here?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nThese are trained experts who have dedicated their lives to caring for endangered species. I always think about this. A lot of people have pets, and there's no training. You get a pet, you figure it out, but you know you love that animal and they love you back. I think about this, the animals who are here have these incredibly trained staff, not just keepers, veterinarians, nutritionists. One of my favorite things is our scientists. Our chief veterinarian is actually trained in acupuncture and acupressure. Our animals will get these, it's not just western medicine, but it's eastern medicine. The staff here is passionate, dedicated, qualified, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. These animals are coming to some incredible care.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThe National Zoo is home to hundreds of wildlife, from the American bison to the Komodo dragon, to the titi monkey. Why do giant pandas seem to garner so much attention? Are there other animals you'd like to see them share the spotlight with?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nThere are some species that are keystone species. They get the attention of people, and then people will come to the zoo to see a giant panda, and then they'll fall in love with a naked mole rat. I feel like pandas are kind of like the gateway animal for a lot of people to caring for and appreciating wildlife. I never begrudge the pandas their charisma, because I think that they bring more people into and appreciate of animals in the natural world. I get asked that question all the time, \"Why do people love pandas so much?\" I think it's a few reasons. I think it's because, well, first of all, they're adorable, most obviously, and the cuteness never wears off. I will still, I've been working with these animals for 16 years, and I still will just stop and marvel at the extreme cuteness of these animals.\n\nThey're cute, they're rare. They're not just rare in the wild, but they're rare in zoos. When you see one, that's a special opportunity, most people on the planet won't have an opportunity to see a giant panda, but they're also a success story. Things in the world, especially when you talk about conservation, when you talk about biodiversity, it can be a little intimidating and overwhelming. You feel like, what can I do? How can I help? Giant pandas is a success story. It's a success of conservation. It's a success of people working together to save a species. When our visitors come here, they are part of that success. When they come here, they see the animals, they care for them, they support the zoo. They are part of the success. I think it's a combination of those three things.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nFinally, is the giant panda cam coming back? How does the National Zoo plan to handle the surge in crowds and desire of so many to see them when they arrive?\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nThe giant panda cam will definitely, it's definitely coming back because we know it's not just the millions of people who come to the zoo, but millions more around the world who want to see our giant pandas. We will definitely bring that back. We don't want just as many people as possible to see the giant pandas. We want everybody who comes here to have a good experience, a memorable experience. It's memorable because that's our goal. Our goal is to educate people, to inspire people, and ultimately, for people to come here and have a good time with their friends, with their family. I don't have the answer yet, but we are planning on ways to make sure that we can accommodate everybody who wants to see the giant pandas.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nWell, it's exciting. Brandi, thank you so much for being on The Excerpt.\n\nBrandi Smith:\n\nYeah, thank you so much for having me.

The 40-year-old climber scaled the 101-floor building in Taipei, Taiwan, in roughly 1 hour, 35 minutes, per Netflix.\n\nAfter standing at the top of the tower, he was seen embracing the moment and taking a selfie.\n\nHe displayed a level of confidence and showmanship throughout the climb, accomplishing a feat that he had thought about for several years.\n\nAfter a few moments at the very top, Honnold scaled down with a harness and rope to embrace his wife.\n\nThe Taipei 101 tower officially opened on Dec. 31, 2004, after being constructed between 1999 and 2004. The building was the world's tallest from its opening until 2009.\n\nHonnold rose to wide fame in 2017 following his historic free solo climb of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. The climb, done without safety equipment, was documented in the film \"Free Solo.\"\n\nAlex Honnold reaches top of Taipei 101\n\nAlex Honnold has reached the 101st floor\n\nHonnold's adventure is almost complete. He just has to scale 200 feet up the spire. The wind has completely picked up.\n\nThe final part of the climb included several more harrowing moments.\n\nAlex Honnold prepares for final section\n\nHe successfully scaled the 10th and final \"dragon\" on the Taipei 101 tower. He had another engaging interaction with a group of fans who were at eye level with him through the window. The next challenge will be steeper.\n\nHonnold was heard on the broadcast stating that he was tired before taking the final stretch. He has been climbing for well over an hour.\n\nSanni Honnold pays Alex a visit\n\nAlex Honnold was on the 60th floor of his climb up the 101-floor building when he had a visit from his wife, Sanni.\n\nTaipei 101 halfway mark\n\nAlex Honnold appears to have reached the halfway point of the building at the 35-minute mark. He continues to express no fear as he looks down from the building. He used the moment to wave at the crowd, talk with the broadcast team and clean off his shoes to prevent potential slipping.\n\n\"The view is amazing,\" Honnold said, looking down during his break. \"...

He stopped and turned around to take a quick break, but also used the moment to take in the scene around him. He does have a live mic on during the climb. As he continued the climb, he could be heard reacting in a joking manner to people who were watching him from out of the window and offered someone a high-five through the window.\n\nAlex Honnold's climb is underway\n\nHonnold has started his climb up a 1,667-foot building in Taiwan.

Who's performing at halftime? What ...", "text": "Jan. 9, 2026, 3:06 p.m. ET\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will take place on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars are among the teams with a chance to make it to the championship, as of Jan. 9.\n\nPuerto Rican artist Bad Bunny is scheduled to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nCharlie Puth will sing the national anthem, joined by Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones for other pregame performances.\n\nFor the first time since the 2017-2018 NFL season, the Jacksonville Jaguars have a chance at making it to the Super Bowl this February.\n\nBut there are still a few games to be played to determine which two teams will face off in Super Bowl LX (60) next month. And this weekend’s Wild Card games will be instrumental in determining which two teams will be on that coveted national stage.\n\nSome things, like where and when the Super Bowl will be held and who will be performing the halftime show this year, are already decided.\n\nHere’s what to know about Super Bowl 60, as of Jan. 9, 2026.\n\nWhen and where is the Super Bowl 2026?\n\nSuper Bowl 2026 will be held on Sunday, Feb. 8, in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe game will be at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat does the LX stand for in the Super Bowl?\n\nEach Super Bowl is named with Roman numerals. This is because the NFL season is split between two calendar years. Although the current season began in 2025, the playoffs and Super Bowl fall in 2026. Using Roman numerals helps clear the confusion of the championship for the 2025 season falling in 2026.\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl will be the 60th, so it’s called Super Bowl LX. In Roman numerals, L is equal to 50 and X is equal to 10, which is why Super Bowl 60 is Super Bowl LX.\n\nWho is playing in the Super Bowl 2026? Could a Florida team make the cut?\n\nIt’s much too early to accurately predict which two teams will face off in Levi’s Stadium on Feb. 8, but the Jacksonville Jaguars could still make it to the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have never made it to a Super Bowl, but the last time the Florida-based team got close was in the 2017-2018 season.\n\nSome early Super Bowl predictions, like one from USA TODAY’s For the Win, predict the Jacksonville team will make it to the February championship and possibly even win.\n\n“The Jaguars are one of the hottest teams in the league, and Trevor Lawrence's quarterback play is a massive part of that,” one For the Win prediction says. “The Rams are a remarkably complete team. The Jags, however, are a complete wagon right now.”\n\nAs of Jan. 9, 14 teams are still “alive,” and 12 of them, including the Jaguars, will play in Wild Card games this weekend.\n\n“In a season where everyone is flawed and no one was truly dominant, the field remains wide open. The top seeds in either conference are vulnerable,” For the Win says. “The worst teams in the AFC and NFC are both guaranteed at least one home game.”\n\nWho is performing at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nBad Bunny was announced as the Super Bowl 60 halftime performer in a commercial during a Cowboys-Packers game on Sunday, Sept. 28. The Puerto Rican reggaeton sensation was seen during a commercial break sitting on a goal post on a beach, wearing a pava, a traditional hat made of Puerto Rican hat palm leaves (a nod to his heritage).\n\nHe reposted the commercial clip to his Instagram profile, captioning it “Super Bowl LX. Bay Area. February 2026.”\n\n“What I’m feeling goes beyond myself. It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… This is for my people, my culture and our history,” he said in a statement shared by the NFL.\n\n“Ve y dile tu abuela que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nFor non-Spanish speakers, the last part of the quote translates to “Go on and tell your grandma that we'll be at the Super Bowl halftime show.”\n\nThis won't be Bad Bunny's first time on the Super Bowl halftime stage, though, as he joined in on Jennifer Lopez and Shakira's Super Bowl halftime show in 2020.\n\nWho is singing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl?\n\nGrammy-nominated pop singer Charlie Puth will sing \"The Star Spangled Banner\" in the Super Bowl LX pregame show.\n\nMulti-genre singer-songwriter and producer Brandi Carlile will sing \"America the Beautiful,\" and singer-songwriter and actress Coco Jones will sing \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" which is sometimes referred to as the Black National Anthem.\n\nHow to watch Super Bowl LX\n\nThe Super Bowl will air live nationwide on NBC and will be available to stream on Peacock.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/955667/nfl-super-bowl-lvi-predictions-london-screenings", "title": "NFL Super Bowl LVI: preview, predictions and London screenings", "text": "Super Bowl LVI will be held at SoFi Stadium (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nAfter two dramatic Conference Championship games, the contenders have been confirmed for the NFL Super Bowl on Sunday 13 February.

The teams in focus\n\nHelmets from the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals (Image credit: Rich Fury/Getty Images)\n\nFor 54 years, no team had played a Super Bowl in their home stadium. After the Los Angeles Rams earned the right to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LVI, it’s now happened in consecutive seasons. Last year at Super Bowl LV, Tom Brady led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs at the Raymond James Stadium. The Rams, who were founded in 1937, have won three NFL championships: 1945, 1951 and 1999.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals, who were founded in 1968, are looking for their first Super Bowl title, playing in the game for the first time since the 1988 season. Since 2000, the Bengals are the fifth team to go from “worst to first” in their division and make the Super Bowl in the same season. Three of the four prior teams to do that – the 2017 Eagles, 2009 Saints and 2001 Patriots – won the Super Bowl.\n\n3. The head coaches\n\nCincinnati’s Zac Taylor (age 38) and the Rams’ Sean McVay (age 36), will be a combined 74 years and 299 days old on Sunday, the youngest combined age for opposing head coaches in Super Bowl history.\n\nMcVay, who was hired by the Rams in 2017 and led the team to a Super Bowl LIII appearance during the 2018 season, is the fifth individual in league history to advance to two Super Bowls within his first five seasons as an NFL head coach.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nTaylor served as an assistant on McVay’s coaching staff with the Rams from 2017-18, including a berth in Super Bowl LIII, prior to becoming the Bengals’ head coach in 2019. With wins in each of the first three rounds of the 2021 post-season, Taylor became the third individual over the last 13 years to win each of his first three post-season games as an NFL head coach.\n\n4. The quarterbacks\n\nFor 49 years, no starting quarterbacks drafted No.1 overall had met in a Super Bowl, until Peyton Manning (1998 NFL Draft) and the Denver Broncos defeated Carolina’s Cam Newton (2011 NFL Draft) in Super Bowl 50.\n\nNow, it will have happened twice in seven seasons, with the Bengals’ Joe Burrow (2020 NFL Draft) and the Rams’ Matthew Stafford (2009 NFL Draft) set to meet on Sunday.\n\nBurrow, 25, guided LSU to a College Football Playoff national championship in 2019. With a win on Sunday, he would join Pro Football Hall of Famers Joe Montana and Joe Namath as the only starting quarterbacks to win both a consensus college football national title and a Super Bowl.\n\nOnly two quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl in their first years with their teams – Trent Dilfer with the Ravens in 2001 and Brady with the Bucs last year. Rams QB Stafford, who was acquired in an offseason trade, could join them on Sunday.\n\n5. Super Bowl LVI UK start time and TV coverage\n\nThe winners of Super Bowl LV will lift the Vince Lombardi Trophy (Image credit: Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nAmerican football’s showpiece fixture will be shown live in the UK on Sky Sports and the BBC. The game will start at 11.30pm on Sunday night and could finish as late as 3.30am. “​​You might want to book the Monday off work,” Londonist said.\n\nSky Sports’s Super Bowl Sunday coverage starts from 10pm and the match between the Bengals and the Rams will be live on Sky Sports NFL and Sky Sports Main Event. BBC’s TV coverage starts at 11pm on BBC Two before switching to BBC One from 11.45pm to 3am. All times GMT.\n\n6. Who will play the Super Bowl half-time show?\n\nFive headline acts have been confirmed for this year’s Pepsi Super Bowl half-time show – Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J Blige, and Kendrick Lamar. Together, they have a combined 44 Grammy Awards, The Independent said.\n\nSinger-songwriter Blije is “no stranger” to the Super Bowl half-time show, CheatSheet said. She performed at the Super Bowl in 2001.\n\n7. Predictions and odds: who will win the Super Bowl?\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\nWill it be the Rams or the Bengals lifting the Vince Lombardi Trophy? According to Oddschecker the Rams are 1/2 to win while the Bengals are 9/5. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is favourite to be named most valuable player (MVP).\n\nIn a simulation of Sunday’s Super Bowl, the Madden NFL 22 game has predicted the winning score and MVP. The EA Sports franchise has an “eerily accurate track record when it comes to predicting Super Bowl winners”, Fortune said. And this year the game says that the Bengals will come out on top with a 24-21 victory over the Rams. Bengals QB Joe Burrow is also tipped to capture the MVP title.\n\nThe Bengals are “one of 12 teams that has yet to win a Super Bowl”, said Jordan Dajani on CBS Sports. That number “decreases to 11” by end of the weekend. Cincy are “clearly this year’s Cinderella” but the offense “can out-score anyone” and the defence is “playing hot as well”.\n\nCincinnati will “lead at half-time”, Sporting News predicts. But Los Angeles will “hold on for their first Super Bowl victory in 22 seasons. Final score: Rams 27, Bengals 24”.\n\nWith two “underdog” teams making the Super Bowl, who better to pick the winner than puppies. On ​​The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that’s exactly what happened last week. “It’s nearly impossible to predict who’s going to win but you’re in luck,” Fallon said. “Because when it comes to predicting things, we have a secret weapon.” Who will win Super Bowl LVI?

About the NFL: a rookie’s guide\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\nHow many teams are there in the NFL?\n\nThere are 32 teams and the winner is crowned at the end-of-season Super Bowl. The NFL’s 32 teams are split into two conferences – the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). The 16 teams in each conference are then split into the East, North, South and West divisions. Each division has four teams.\n\nHow does the NFL season work?\n\nThe regular season lasts 18 weeks, during which time each team plays 17 matches. At the end of the regular season, the top team in each conference’s four divisions, plus each conference’s two teams (wild cards) with the next-best records, qualify for the play-offs. The 12 teams are seeded by their win-loss record. The Wild Card Round and Division Round lead to the Conference Championship Round, where the top two teams battle it out to become the NFC and AFC champions. The two Conference champions then meet at the Super Bowl.\n\nHow do the NFL teams line up?\n\nIf you’re new to American football a great place to start is by reading NFL.com’s beginner’s guide. The two teams line up in the following way: one 11-man team has possession of the football and is called the offence and the other 11-man team is the defence. A match is split into four 15-minute quarters, with a 12-minute half-time break. The Super Bowl half-time show usually lasts between 20 and 30 minutes.\n\nHow are points scored?\n\nThere are four ways to keep the scoreboard ticking over: a touchdown is worth six points, conversions get one or two points, field goals are three points, and a safety is worth two points. The object of the game is to score more points than the opposition.", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2026/01/20/nfl-playoff-picks-predictions-super-bowl-winner-broncos-seahawks-rams-patriots/88230644007/", "title": "NFL playoff predictions for AFC, NFC championship games, Super ...", "text": "Jan. 20, 2026 Updated Jan. 24, 2026, 9:42 a.m. ET\n\nThe NFL playoffs continue with two games in the conference championship round on Jan. 25.\n\nTwo games that will determine who makes the Super Bowl.\n\nWho will win the AFC championship game?

The final three teams in each conference are considered wild cards, the best remaining teams by record.\n\nTiebreakers can be used if teams have the same record. For example, this year the Houston Texans earned the No. 5 seed in the AFC over the Buffalo Bills despite having the same 12-5 record because the Texans won their head-to-head meeting with the Bills and had a better conference win percentage (10-2 to 9-3).\n\nThe playoffs have four rounds: the wild-card round, the divisional round, the conference championship games and the Super Bowl.

The division winners are ranked by best record to worst and will each host at least one playoff game.\n\nIn the first round, the No. 1 seed from each conference receives a bye into the division round as the remaining teams – seeds Nos. 2-7 – play for a chance to move on. The team seeded higher in each playoff matchup hosts that contest until the Super Bowl.\n\nAfter the wild-card round, each No. 1 seed will play the lowest remaining seed in its conference during the divisional round.\n\nAt the same time, the second-highest seed will face the second-lowest seed. This setup ensures that the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds cannot meet the No. 1 seed until the conference championship. They will either be knocked out in the wild-card round or play against each other or a lower seed in the divisional round, depending on any upsets.\n\nThe winners of the two divisional round games will move on to the conference championships, which will take place on Sunday, January 25.\n\nThe conference champions will have a week off before heading to Santa Clara to play in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, Feb. 8.\n\nNFL playoff bracket\n\nThese are the current wild-card matchups, given the state of the playoff picture.\n\nThis bracket is subject to change pending the results in Week 18:\n\nAFC wild card\n\nNo. 2 New England Patriots (13-3, AFC East winners) vs. No. 7 Buffalo Bills (11-5, wild card No. 3)\n\nNo. 3 Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4, AFC South leaders) vs. No. 6 Los Angeles Chargers (11-5, wild card No. 2)\n\nNo. 4 Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7, AFC North leaders) vs. No. 5 Houston Texans (11-5, wild card No. 1)\n\nNFC wild card", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/03"}]}

In the same period last year, job gains averaged nearly 123,000.\n\n“Clearly the tariffs, the policy, is starting to bite into the labor market,” Elizabeth Crofoot, senior economist and principal researcher at Lightcast, told USA TODAY.\n\n-Bailey Schulz\n\nTariff uncertainty contributed to weak jobs report, White House acknowledges\n\nA top White House economic adviser acknowledged that \"uncertainty\" over President Trump's tariffs contributed to the weaker than expected jobs report.\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran argued on MSNBC that July's number was \"decent\" but admitted that downward revisions to May and June \"are not great.\" He chalked those up to seasonal factors such as teachers on summer break and cited Trump's border policies, which he said were eliminating jobs held by foreign workers.\n\n\"Finally, there was, you know, some uncertainty over tariffs, as we were negotiating,\" he said.\n\nThe uncertainty was needed to create leverage, he said. \"But that uncertainty is now resolved, the trade deals are in place, the One Big Beautiful Bill is law, both the trade deals and the tax bill have very powerful incentives to create an economic boom in America.\"\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nDoes the Fed get an early peak at the monthly jobs report?\n\nNot really.\n\nAccording to Willam Poole, former chief executive of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, the Fed has “a minimal advantage, if any, in terms of knowledge of facts.”\n\nIt is so minimal that it doesn’t really matter, he wrote in an article posted on the Richmond Fed’s website. What data Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell receives also comes after the Fed’s monetary policy meeting and decisions have been made.\n\n“The Fed chair gets the unemployment report through the chair of the CEA (Council of Economic Advisers) late Thursday afternoon, just a few hours before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the data publicly on Friday at 8:30 a.m.” Eastern time, he said. “This same \"advantage\" of a few hours is true of all the data released by federal statistical agencies.”\n\n-Medora Lee\n\nStock sell-off continues\n\nU.S. stocks remained negative as investors responded to Trump's tariff blitz and a disappointing July jobs report.\n\nAt 12:26 p.m. ET, the blue-chip Dow fell 0.99%, or 438.66 points, to 43,692.32; the broad S&P 500 slipped 1.16%, or 73.52 points, to 6,265.87, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.58%, or 334.17 points to 20,788.28.

President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order increasing tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% from 25% on all products not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.\n\nThe White House cited what it said was Canada's failure to stop fentanyl smuggling and a failure to address U.S. concerns about trade barriers.\n\n\"Team Canada is still in Washington working on a deal and they're going to be there until we either have a conclusion of a good deal for Canada or that it's time to take a pause and walk away,\" said Volpe, president of Canada's national Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association.\n\nCarney wants a new deal to reset bilateral relations, saying Trump's move to impose tariffs had irrevocably upended the decades-old trading and security ties between the two neighbors. The talks though have so far produced little.\n\n-Reuters\n\nCoffee catastrophe? Brazilian beans will head to China, analysts say\n\nThe Trump administration's steep import tariff on Brazilian coffee looks set to reshuffle trade routes for beans from the world's top grower and exporter, benefiting China and incentivizing traders to look for indirect routes into the U.S.\n\nA 50% tariff on some Brazilian products, including coffee, will begin on August 6, the Trump administration said this week. The move will challenge commodities traders and Brazilian coffee exporters to find buyers for the roughly 8 million bags sold to U.S. coffee processors every year.\n\nAt around 25 million bags per year, the U.S. is the world's largest coffee consumer. A third of that comes from Brazil, through bilateral trade that was worth $4.4 billion in the 12 months ended in June.\n\n\"The global coffee trade flow will be reshuffled. The pain will be felt from Sao Paulo to Seattle - from origin to roaster, to cafe chains, grocers, and morning commuters,\" said Michael J. Nugent, a senior U.S. coffee broker and owner of MJ Nugent & Co.\n\n-Reuters\n\nPoor jobs report boosts chances of a rate cut\n\nThe much weaker-than-expected report is likely to trigger a Federal Reserve rate cut, economists said. The CME FedWatch tool that tracks the market's odds the Fed will change interest rates at upcoming meetings shows an 83% chance of a rate cut in September.\n\n\"This payroll report kicks the door wide open for a September rate cut,\" said Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments. \"Although the effects of tariff pass-through still lie ahead, the Fed will not want to wait too long to begin its cutting cycle.\"\n\n-Medora Lee\n\nSwiss aren't neutral over Trump tariffs on luxury watches and chocolate\n\nThe Swiss watch industry has been suffering from weak global demand and sales lately. A decision by the Trump administration to impose a 39% tariff on Switzerland may add to their hard time.\n\nThe Swiss government said it viewed the White House's new tariffs with \"great regret\" and said it \"continues to strive for a negotiated solution.\"\n\nOnly Laos and Myanmar (also known as Burma), at 40%, and Syria, at 41%, fared worse than Switzerland in Trump's fresh avalanche of tariffs.\n\nThe Alpine country now has until Aug. 7 to work out a trade deal with the United States or chocolate, jewellery and, yes, watches, will be subject to levies more than double the 15% rate for most European Union imports into the United States. Switzerland's pharmaceuticals sector was not included in the tariffs.\n\n-Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nMorning stocks down on tariff and unemployment news\n\nAt 9:46 a.m. ET, the blue-chip Dow fell 1.33%, or 588.22 points, to 43,542.76; while the broad S&P 500 slipped 1.62%, or 102.73 points, to 6,236.66, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 2.13%, or 449.35 points to 20,673.10.\n\n-Medora Lee\n\nTrump defends tariffs, says he’s open to future deals\n\nIn an interview with NBC the evening of July 31, Trump said his aggressive tariff plan will rake in “hundreds of billions of dollars, and very quickly.”\n\nOpponents have raised concerns about potential price increases from the heavy tariffs. The president dismissed those warnings. “The only price that’s spiked is the hundreds of billions of dollars coming in,” Trump said.\n\nThe new rates will go into effect in seven days. Trump told NBC it is “too late” for countries to reach an agreement to prevent those duties.\n\nBut, he said, “It doesn’t mean that somebody doesn’t come along in four weeks and say we can make some kind of a deal.”\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nUnemployment up on weak U.S. jobs report\n\nU.S. employers added a disappointing 73,000 jobs in July as payroll growth slowed amid President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs, an intensifying immigration crackdown and massive federal layoffs.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.2%, the Labor Department said Friday.\n\nBefore the report was released, economists had estimated that 105,000 jobs were added in July.\n\n-Paul Davidson\n\nDem senator: Trump will ‘turn on a dime’ if economy sours\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, told CNN he anticipates the economy will take a heavy hit from Trump’s tariffs – and that if conditions sour too much, the president may shift positions.\n\n“If the stock market and the jobs report and the inflation numbers over the next couple of weeks all head in the wrong direction,” Coons said, “I suspect you’ll see Trump turn on a dime and change his tariff policy and position.”\n\nHigher prices will be the “inevitable outcome,” the Delaware senator said.\n\n“It’s the opposite of what he ran on, which was lowering costs.”\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nChina and Mexico not part of Trump's tariff blast\n\nNot included in Trump's order are two of the United States' largest trading partners, China and Mexico.\n\nTrump and Chinese officials have discussed extending a 90-day tariff truce that the two sides struck in May in which both countries held off on imposing massive, triple-digit tariffs on imports on one another.\n\nTrump on July 31 said he's giving Mexico another 90 days to come to a long-term agreement with the United States to avoid higher tariffs. In the meantime, Mexican imports will still be levied with a 25% tariff that Trump imposed over the flow of fentanyl from the country.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nTrump tariffs put a new spin on the Canadian Old-Fashioned\n\nAn Old-Fashioned without Kentucky bourbon?\n\nOh, Canada.\n\nStarting in February, bars and liquor stores in Canada removed bourbon and other U.S.-made spirits and wines from their shelves to protest President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and his unwelcome suggestion that our northern neighbors become the 51st U.S. state.\n\nTrump’s overtures have not gone over well in French-speaking Quebec or the other Canadian provinces. Canadians have found all kinds of ways to let the American president know what he can do with his scandaleux proposition. Some are proudly flying their country’s red-and-white Maple Leaf flag.

The worst is yet to come | Opinion", "text": "Colin Grabow\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nMarch 31, 2025, 5:06 a.m. ET\n\nThe U.S. economy is staring down the barrel of a tax increase to the tune of several hundred billion dollars. If the Trump administration follows through with its threats (never a sure thing), we will this week see the imposition of so-called reciprocal tariffs to ostensibly match the burden placed by other countries on U.S. exports.\n\nAs President Donald Trump and administration officials tell it, the move is rooted in a desire to stop foreign countries from ripping Americans off through unfair trade. But such claims warrant considerable skepticism.\n\nThe administration’s words and actions make it increasingly clear that this reciprocity talk is just a fig leaf for higher tariffs. They aren’t a means to an end but the end themselves. And unless Congress acts − an unlikely proposition − American businesses and consumers alike will suffer.\n\nOn its face, the pursuit of tariff reciprocity may seem a commonsense approach. Although not exactly the golden rule, it seems darn close. Why not give U.S. trading partners a taste of their own medicine?\n\nBut the seductive logic of reciprocity falls apart upon even cursory examination.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nTariffs are a tax on American consumers\n\nTariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country’s consumers. Why should the United States follow suit if other countries are so foolish as to increase those taxes?\n\nFurthermore, there’s no guarantee such a high-pressure approach will prompt U.S. trading partners to change their policies (and history argues the opposite). What has been accomplished if the United States inflicts economic damage to itself while foreigners stand pat (or, as is often the case, retaliate)?\n\nInstead of following foreigners’ whims, Americans should set their trade policies based on what makes sense for the United States. That’s a real “America First” policy.\n\nUnfortunately, Trump believes, against the overwhelming sentiment of economists, that higher tariffs are good for the economy.\n\nAs details filter out about the administration’s April tariff plans, it’s increasingly apparent that the reciprocity talk is a ploy to quickly raise taxes on imports.\n\nFirst, the issues that allegedly merit higher U.S. tariffs change almost daily. So far, the list includes topics as varied as foreign tariff and nontariff barriers, domestic tax policy, currency manipulation, wage levels and “labor suppression.” No doubt, fresh justifications await.\n\nPractical considerations further expose the sham. Given the complexity of the task and the government’s limited staff, examining each U.S. trading partner's policies and their trade effects and calculating an equivalent U.S. tariff in a matter of weeks simply isn't possible.\n\nFor example, a U.S. government investigation launched last year into alleged unfair Chinese trade practices in the maritime industry took months to complete (and even then, delivered a flawed final product). Performing a similar evaluation for every industry, policy and country (even just some) would take years, not weeks − if it were possible at all.\n\nWhatever reciprocal tariffs the Trump administration announces this week will be shoddy guesstimates detached from economic reality, not the rigorous analysis that such matters deserve.\n\nEqually important, the Trump administration has provided no indication that it intends to assess the United States’ own nontariff barriers and then reduce U.S. tariff and nontariff barriers where they exceed those of its trading partners.\n\nIt’s certainly not for a lack of such disparities.\n\nU.S. duties of 25% on imported light trucks compare with rates of 10% in the European Union and zero in Japan. Similarly, the Jones Act, which prohibits foreign shipping and foreign-built vessels in domestic commerce, is considered the world’s most restrictive maritime cabotage law. The United States also doles out billions in agriculture, semiconductor and renewable energy subsidies and applies high regulatory barriers on imported food and medical goods.\n\nIf the Trump administration is committed to reciprocity, these trade barriers would be nixed for trade with low-barrier countries like New Zealand. There is little chance they will be.\n\nTrump is wrong about economic benefits of tariffs\n\nThe reason is that reciprocity talk is window dressing for run-of-the-mill protectionism. And really, what else should we expect? Trump is, after all, a self-described “tariff man” who believes tariffs will make the United States “so rich we’re not going to know where to spend that money.”\n\nHis close trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has repeatedly said (wrongly) that tariffs reduce trade deficits and boost economic growth. And many Republicans see tariffs as a means to pay for extending Trump’s tax cuts.\n\nSo why would these tariff aficionados seek reciprocal arrangements in which the United States and its trading partners lower their import duties?\n\nLet’s acknowledge the obvious: Trump is a committed protectionist. He doesn’t believe that tariffs are a necessary evil, or any kind of evil, but a path to a more prosperous future and fuller federal coffers. Hence, the flimsy, contradictory, and risible justifications for tariffs on some of America's strongest partners and most reliable allies.\n\nReciprocity is just the latest excuse for the higher import taxes that Trump has long desired and − abetted by congressional fecklessness − will likely soon get.\n\nAmericans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different.\n\nColin Grabow is an associate director at the Cato Institute’s Herbert A.

He said beyond the auto tariffs, which auto executives and critics say could have a devastating effect on Michigan, he would impose what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on other countries around the world, raising taxes on imports from countries that impose higher tariffs on American imports than the U.S. does on theirs.\n\nTrump called the tariffs \"our declaration of economic independence,\" arguing they will bring jobs back into the U.S. and help America sell more of its products overseas, while also raising federal revenue.\n\nTrump said his administration had calculated \"the combined rate of all their (other countries') tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating\" charged against U.S. products and would put in place a tax worth approximately half of that on those countries' imports, though that amount varied depending on the country involved. \"They rip us off; it's so sad to see,\" Trump said of the European Union in one example.\n\nHe said those \"reciprocal tariffs\" would begin at a baseline of 10% to start being charged at midnight on Saturday. But he added many countries will pay more than that for imports into the U.S. An eight-page list released by the White House showed tariff rates ranging from a high of 61% on Libya and 50% on products from Lesotho in Africa and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a self-governong French territory on an island near Newfoundland, down to 10% for most trading partners, including the United Kingdom and Brazil.\n\nThose additional tariffs over 10% were set to go into effect in a week on April 9, the White House said in a fact sheet.\n\nThe tariff on China was set at 34%, apparently in addition to those already being levied against imports from that country, as well as 26% on India, 24% on Japan and 20% on the European Union.\n\nBut the list did not include reciprocal tariff rates for Canada and Mexico, which Trump had initially set at 25% earlier this year, arguing that illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs from those nations constituted an emergency and demanded it. He later delayed its implementation. But there had been questions raised when Trump announced those tariffs and tariffs on imported autos about whether barriers to taxes on some or all products covered under the existing North American trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico would be honored or not.\n\nThe fact sheet put out by the White House said that the new reciprocal tariffs don't affect those earlier announced by Trump against Canada and Mexico and that products compliant with the trade agreement between the three nations — known as the USMCA — would not be subject to any additional tariff. But it remained unclear to what extent under the previously announced orders the Trump administration considers finished autos, components and parts crisscrossing the nation's borders to be \"USMCA-compliant\" and therefore tariff-free. Items considered noncompliant would face a 25% tariff, the fact sheet said.\n\nMeanwhile, 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which are also hitting automakers and other manufacturers, also remain in place.\n\nTrump has repeatedly brushed off concerns that a worldwide tariff scheme could potentially touch off a global trade war and suggested higher prices are acceptable in the short term if they lead to more U.S. manufacturing. Economists, however, generally expect other nations to retaliate against U.S. tariffs and agree that, ultimately, tariffs on imported goods are taxes effectively passed on to consumers, raising prices on all affected products.\n\n\"I have always said that when used strategically, tariffs are a critical tool to bring back jobs and support American workers and industries,\" said U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor. \"However, the key word is ‘strategically.’ I’m concerned about the chaotic and immediate implementation of these wide-reaching tariffs. Changes don’t happen overnight, and companies need stability and time to make adjustments. We must bring manufacturing capacity, supply chains, and jobs in critical areas including steel, autos, and pharmaceuticals back to America, and we need to renegotiate USMCA. I will work with anyone to achieve these goals.”\n\nA week ago, Trump signed an executive order ahead of what he had taken to calling this Wednesday's \"liberation day\" set of tariffs against other nations, imposing a 25% tax on all cars and light-duty trucks imported into the U.S.\n\nThose auto tariffs — which auto industry officials and analysts said could cripple manufacturers and drive up costs in a widely integrated market — are scheduled to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Thursday, though some automakers had hoped there could be a delay or last-minute exemptions put into place. Trump also said last week he would also impose a 25% tariff on imported auto parts no later than May 3 and made no public pronouncement on Thursday that he would back off that.\n\nHitting Canada and Mexico with additional tariffs — especially on autos and auto parts — could have a devastating effect on North American automakers, especially General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, otherwise known as the Detroit Three, who have a web of supply chains and assembly networks that crisscross the borders with both countries. While UAW President Shawn Fain has supported the tariffs, saying Trump is right that they could reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing jobs, analysts have said they could add thousands to the cost of a new car and result in enormous sales declines in the U.S.\n\nGM and Ford did not immediately issue any statements regarding Trump's White House remarks on Wednesday. Stellantis issued a statement saying it \"continues to assess the effects of the recently announced U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and will continue to engage with the U.S. administration on these policy changes.\"\n\nGlenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, an association that works to promote and expand the industry, remarked that while the White House said USMCA-compliant goods remained exempt for now, he remained concerned about \"the prospect of a significant rise in the price of vehicles for sale,\" saying that would \"reduce demand and hurt the automotive industry and its workforce, all of which have an outsized impact on Michigan’s economy.\"\n\nThere were other signs that some were uneasy with the president's broad tariff push.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Senate voted 51-48 to pass a resolution that would theoretically terminate the emergency authorization Trump claimed in threatening to impose tariffs on Canada, noting that country's long-standing alliance with the U.S. and the fact that the Northern border sees comparatively little illegal immigration or drug flow into the U.S. The resolution carried little more than symbolic value since the Republican-led U.S. House had already passed a rule blocking any such joint resolution from being voted on in that chamber. But it did serve to show some Republican opposition to the Canadian tariffs, with four members of the president's party in support.\n\nSens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, both of Kentucky, voted in favor of the resolution, as did all Democrats, including Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.\n\nNo such opposition was present at the White House, however, where a retired UAW worker from Macomb County, Brian Pannebecker, was invited to speak briefly, saying he brought several UAW members with him.\n\n\"I’ve watched plant after plant after plant in the metro Detroit area close,\" said Pannebecker, who has long been a vocal supporter of Trump's in Michigan. \"Donald Trump's policies are going to bring product back into those underutilized plants. There's going to be new investment, there's going to be new plants built,\" he said.\n\nReaction to Trump's announcement was decidedly mixed. Some Republican members of Michigan's congressional delegation applauded it, with U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain, of Bruce Township, a member of House GOP leadership, saying America has for too long been taken advantage of by its trading partners and that \"President Trump made it clear today that we will no longer put American workers at an unfair disadvantage.\"\n\nOthers, however, were less supportive. U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Bay City, said Trump’s tariffs \"will raise costs on working-class Michigan families at a time when we can least afford it,\" and U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Birmingham, who served as the de facto chief of staff to the Obama administration task force that designed the rescue of GM and what was then Chrysler in 2009-10, said while targeted tariffs can protect American workers and companies, Trump \"has made one announcement after another on tariffs,\" leaving businesses and workers \"grappling\" with what they mean.\n\n\"Consistency is key for the U.S. auto industry and our world-class workers who rely on these jobs,\" Stevens said.\n\nJennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, a trade group that includes international automakers doing business in the U.S., including Toyota, Honda, Suburu and others, said Trump's tariffs \"will have a tremendous impact on the entire U.S. auto industry,\" noting its members \"have spent the last 40 years building the highly-integrated supply chains that power North American auto manufacturing.\n\n\"It is impossible to rebuild those supply chains in a matter of weeks, especially with the added financial burden of tariffs,\" she said. \"While we share the president’s goal of bringing more manufacturing to the United States, we must do so in a way that protects American manufacturing jobs, supports suppliers, provides affordable options for consumers, and allows the industry to remain competitive.”\n\nIn Canada, others expressed concern.\n\n“The world is waking up today to a reality that Canada has been living with for months,\" said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \"Businesses around the world have had their uncertainty expanded, the effects of which will undoubtedly boomerang to Canada as well. This chain reaction of tariffs and counter-tariffs will have a real and distressing economic impact on Americans, Canadians and the global economy.\"\n\n(This story was updated with new information and to correct the spelling of Brian Pannebecker's name and the territorial status of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.)\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

He said, \"no.\" Auto, auto parts and earlier announced tariffs on imported aluminum and steel are considered part of those sectoral tariffs.\n\nThe White House later provided the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, confirmation that the auto and other sectoral tariffs remain in place.\n\nStill, many analysts are reacting to the news of the pause as a positive sign for the auto industry.\n\n\"Pausing tariffs is good news and could help consumer confidence despite the pause not including the 25% foreign auto tariff announced March 26,\" Morningstar autos analyst David Whiston told the Free Press. \"Any sign to think consumers are better off will be welcomed enthusiastically by the market, however, foreign auto tariffs are still out there as is an additional 25% for non-USMCA compliant vehicles,\" a reference to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. \"The 125% rate on Chinese imports (I believe that’s 150% for autos) is still going to hurt consumers’ affordability for goods beyond autos, so plenty of headwinds still out there,\" Whitson added.\n\nBut others, such as MichAuto, the group that works to promote, retain and grow Michigan's auto industry, said April 9’s development was a disappointment.\n\n“Unfortunately, the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs announced today does not extend to the 25% tariffs on assembled vehicles and components implemented on April 3 or other sector-based tariffs, like those on steel and aluminum,” said Glenn Stevens, MichAuto executive director and vice president of Detroit Regional Chamber. “Michigan's signature industry and the supply chains and employees that sustain it will continue to endure the uncertainty and disruption of these fluctuating trade policies.”\n\nStevens said MichAuto continues to advocate for protecting the automotive industry's complex international supply chain framework from harmful fragmentation that weakens its global competitiveness.\n\n“The prompt renegotiation of the USMCA and maintenance of the key trade partnerships it enables are better tools for strengthening and growing the North American manufacturing economy,” Stevens said.\n\nIt also remains unclear exactly how Michigan's auto industry will be hit by the auto sector tariffs because the Trump administration has said that autos and auto parts that are considered compliant with USMCA would remain tariff-free. The administration hasn't explained further what finished vehicles or other components coming into the U.S. it may or may not consider compliant under the terms of that deal.\n\nThe White House clarified, however, that Canada and Mexico still face a tariff of 25% generally on non-USMCA compliant goods, other than energy and potash imports which are taxed at 10%, despite Bessent saying those neighbors would face an overall 10% tariff like most other nations outside the White House on April 9. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico were announced earlier this year and they weren't specifically named in the round of reciprocal tariffs announced last week.\n\nThe Detroit automakers did not immediately provide a comment on April 9's development. The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Stellantis in Washington, D.C., referred the Free Press to its March 26 statement.\n\n\"U.S. automakers are committed to President Trump’s vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the administration on durable policies that help Americans. In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President’s USMCA agreement,\" said Matt Blunt, president of AAPC.\n\nThe increased pressure on China is also expected to impact Michigan businesses, including the auto industry, giving the global nature of supply chains.\n\n'Gut punch to Detroit automakers' ‒ with some hope\n\nThe Trump administration said the president agreed to lower the reciprocal tariffs to 10% for three months because some 75 countries approached U.S. officials looking to negotiate. Only China, he said, sought to retaliate aggressively.\n\nMarkets jumped on the news that the reciprocal tariffs, some of which were as high as 50%, would be paused.\n\nWedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives told the Free Press that while the “auto industry cannot pop the champagne like many other industries” on the pause in tariffs, Wall Street’s gleeful reaction to the news indicates that investors assume negotiations will happen even on the autos tariffs.\n\n“So even though it’s a gut punch to the Detroit automakers, it shows that negotiations are happening,” Ives said. “I expect that auto tariffs are going to be front and center on the table over the coming weeks because Detroit would be decimated by these auto tariffs and the UAW and the 313 are very important for this country and for the administration. I think that’s going to be the next step.”\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain has come out in support of tariffs, saying they will drive more manufacturing back into the country and create jobs. But Ives said the near-term negative effects tariffs would have by increasing automakers’ costs and potentially driving down sales would be so damaging it could mean production pauses and layoffs. Those would be “devastating” results that will move the administration, Ives said.\n\nMeanwhile, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was visiting the nation's capital on April 9 and was expected to meet with the president. Earlier in the day, she delivered a speech where she lambasted Trump's broad use of tariffs, but said targeted ones should be used to increase manufacturing jobs and protect industries like the auto industry in Michigan without widely increasing consumer costs and threatening stock market gains.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

For the latest news, view our story for Wednesday, April 9.\n\nThe Trump administration will hit China with 104% tariffs starting at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, the White House said Tuesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had threatened an extra 50% on tariffs against China − in addition to an initial 20% that was supplemented by 34% \"reciprocal'' levies Wednesday − after Beijing said it would respond with a 34% tax of its own.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the full package of more than 100% in levies would kick in overnight.\n\n\"It was a mistake for China to retaliate,\" she said. \"When America is punched, (Trump) punches back harder, and that's why there will be 104% tariffs going into effect on China tonight at midnight.\"\n\nThe big blow's announcement likely contributed to a sharp reversal of fortunes on Wall Street, where a day that began with major gains later headed south. All three main indexes closed down, from 0.84% to 2.15%.\n\nLeavitt said Trump wanted her to tell reporters that if China \"reaches out to make a deal he will be incredibly gracious, but he's going to do what's best for the American people.\"\n\nLeavitt declined to say what it would take for Trump to pull back on the tariffs, saying it would be imprudent for her to share those conditions from the podium.\n\nLatest on markets: View Tuesday's stock market news\n\nStock market swings up and down: A wild day amid tariff turmoil, new China threats\n\nStocks plummet after early rebound amid tariff negotiations\n\nGlobal markets at first bounced back Tuesday as Trump and his top advisers said scores of countries have contacted the administration to open tariff talks, but tensions with China remain high and by the afternoon the gains had turned into significant losses.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow erased 1,400 points in gains and wound up dropping by 0.84%, or 320.01points, to 37,645.59; the broad S&P 500 slid 1.57%, or 79.48 points, to 4,982.77; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 2.15%, or 335.35 points, to 15,267.91.\n\nU.S. stocks had swung wildly Monday, opening lower, then briefly popping higher on a report − later denied − that Trump would delay tariffs for 90 days, before dropping again on a new Trump threat to levy an additional 50% tax on China if it didn't retreat from its 34% retaliatory tariff planned for Thursday. Volume was the highest in at least 18 years: roughly 29 billion shares changed hands.\n\nTough talk to and from China regarding tariffs\n\nBeijing on Tuesday issued a stern rebuke in response to Trump's threat of an additional 50% tax on Chinese imports, calling the move \"blackmail\" and vowing to \"fight to the end.\"\n\nTrump wrote on his social media platform that China has not contacted the U.S. but said he believes Beijing wants to make a deal: \"We are waiting for their call. It will happen!\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent called China's defiant response to Trump's threats of higher tariffs \"a big mistake.\" In a Fox News interview, Bessent said leaders from about 70 countries have reached out for tariff negotiations and that, depending on what they offer, the U.S. \"can end up with some good deals.\"\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Trump, who said he spoke with South Korea’s acting president, Han Duck-soo, and that the country wants to make a deal, as do \"many\" other nations.\n\nTrump says the US is already taking in $2 billion a day from tariffs\n\nTrump on Tuesday claimed the U.S. is already taking in $2 billion a day from his recently imposed tariffs as he defended what he called “explosive” duties on imports that have rattled the markets.\n\n“That’s a lot of money,” Trump said at a White House event in which he signed a series of executive orders aimed at revitalizing the depleting coal industry in the U.S.\n\nTrump did not explain how he calculated the revenue collections. A 10% baseline tariff on all imports went into effect on Saturday. On Wednesday, Trump’s additional tariffs on more than 60 countries are set to begin including 104% tariffs on imports from China.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nIs a trade deficit a bad thing? Not necessarily\n\nIn his campaign to impose tariffs on foreign countries near and far, Trump has presented those nations as ripping off Americans because of the United States’ longstanding trade deficit. But is that accurate?\n\nExperts say trade deficits are not inherently good or bad and can be the result of a country becoming a desirable destination for foreign investment, as is the case with the U.S. and its highly regarded currency, the dollar. Other nations export their goods to America so they can acquire dollars.\n\nBuying imported goods can be cheaper than purchasing domestic products because of higher wages and the cost of necessities like electricity in the U.S.\n\n“Deficits themselves are not unfair,” said Christopher Barnes, president of the market research firm Escalent. “There are just things that developed economies are going to buy from lesser developed economies.”\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nTariffs may cause double-digit hikes in health insurance premiums\n\nHealth care companies are delaying projects, changing budgets and shifting costs to health insurers and patients in anticipation of tariff-related economic harms, according to a new survey by Black Book Research.\n\nThe firm surveyed 200 health-care leaders at hospitals, health systems, pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufacturers, health insurers and computer vendors. The survey was conducted March 6 through April 2, the day announced a 10% tariff on most imported goods. The survey doesn't reflect the triple-digit tariffs on Chinese imports announced Tuesday.\n\nAmong hospital chief financial officers, 75% began \"short-term cost shifting\" to health insurers and patients and 29% considered staff restructuring or wage freezes. Nearly all of the hospital finance officers are delaying computer and technology upgrades.\n\nConsumers can expect a direct hit too. All but 5% of health insurance executives anticipate higher medical bills will yield double-digit premium hikes on health insurance plans next year.\n\n− Ken Alltucker\n\nTrump prioritizing allies in tariffs talks, adviser says\n\nTrump's top economic adviser said Tuesday that he has put together a proposal outlining the countries that should receive priority for meetings amid requests for tariffs negotiations.\n\nKevin Hassett told Fox News that Trump is prioritizing talks with America’s top allies and trading partners, such as South Korea and Japan. He spoke to the leaders of both nations this week.\n\n“There are a heck of a lot of concessions on the table,” Hassett said. “In the end, the president of course is going to be the one who decides whether the deal is good enough to change his mind about the tariffs.”\n\nMaking iPhones in US a pipe dream, analysts say\n\nWill iPhones be made in America? “Absolutely,” says White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Not so fast, say industry insiders.\n\nWhile Trump administration officials and even the president himself, according to Leavitt, envision a day when the ubiquitous phones are manufactured domestically, Apple analysts say it’s a political pipe dream.\n\n\"The president believes the U.S. has the capability to make iPhones,\" CNBC’s Kelly Evans said to Laura Martin, senior entertainment and internet analyst at Needham & Co. \"Yeah, I don't think that's a thing,\" Martin replied.\n\nApple makes most of its iPhones in China, which the White House said is about to get slammed first thing Wednesday morning with a 104% tariff rate on the products it sends to the U.S. Apple shares were down 5% Tuesday.\n\n“Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics/chips/semi fabs/hardware/smartphones, etc., are made for US consumers over the last 30 years,” Wedbush Securities’ Daniel Ives said in a research note.\n\n− Jessica Guynn\n\nTrump top trade official defends tariffs to Congress\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended Trump's controversial tariffs during a Tuesday morning hearing before the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n\"We must move away from an economy that is based solely on government spending and the financial sector, and we must become an economy based on producing real goods and services that provide jobs for working-class and middle-class Americans in their communities,\" Greer said.\n\n\"This adjustment may be challenging at times, and in a moment of drastic overdue change, I'm confident, I'm certain, the American people can rise to the challenge as they've done before,\" he added.\n\nRepublicans on the committee acknowledged the stock market plummeting and other potential economic costs of the tariffs but indicated they were hopeful Trump's policies would also have positive effects.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, the top Democrat on the committee, said Trump and his advisers have not provided \"any explanation\" for what the tariffs are meant to accomplish. \"The U.S. economy has gone from the envy of the world to a laughingstock in less time than it took to finish March Madness,\" he said.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nGOP lawmakers like NC's Tillis concerned, 'skeptical'\n\nThe tariffs and their aftermath are making some Republicans in Congress nervous about backlash from their constituents, be it in town halls or in next year's midterms.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., expressed deep skepticism of the policy to Greer at Tuesday's hearing, saying, “Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?” Tillis, one of the most vulnerable Republican senators up for reelection in 2026, suggested to Greer that the administration has until February next year to fix the economy before voters will punish Republicans at the ballot box. “I wish you well,” he said, adding he is “skeptical.”\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump says South Korea deal may be imminent\n\nTrump said Tuesday that a deal with South Korea may be on the horizon and added that \"many other countries\" want to bargain, including China.\n\n“We have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries,” he said on Truth Social, describing his call with South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo. “Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good.”\n\nTrump added that his team is fielding calls from other nations and negotiations involve more than just trade and tariffs.\n\nIndonesia announces slew of concessions\n\nIndonesia's chief economic minister said Tuesday the country will buy gas and soybeans from the U.S. and reduce taxes on electronic goods and steel as part of ongoing negotiations.\n\nAirlangga Hartarto made the announcement at a conference discussing how to respond to U.S. tariffs. Hartarto is set to lead a delegation traveling to Washington on April 17.\n\nA 32% tariff on imports from Southeast Asia's biggest economy is set to take effect early Wednesday.\n\nBritish finance minister: 'A trade war is in nobody's interest'\n\nBritish finance minister Rachel Reeves said Tuesday that she would soon meet Bessent as London hopes to reach a deal to reduce the tariffs imposed by Trump.\n\n\"A trade war is in nobody's interest,\" she said, speaking to Parliament. \"It is why we must remain pragmatic, cool-headed and pursue the best deal with the United States that is in our national interest.\"\n\nTrump has imposed a 10% tariff on most imports from Britain and a 25% tariff on key sectors such as cars and steel.\n\nTreasury secretary: China playing 'a losing hand'\n\nBessent criticized China's defiant response to Trump's threats of higher tariffs, saying such a stance would not accomplish anything.\n\n\"We are the deficit country,\" the Treasury secretary said in an interview with CNBC. \"So what do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one fifth to them of what they export to us. So that is a losing hand for them.\"\n\nBessent said \"good deals\" could come out of tariff negotiations, which he said “had nothing to do with sliding markets.”\n\nSmall businesses bracing for tariff-related hardships\n\nWith markets swinging worldwide, a small-business lending company executive is among those asking whether the Trump tariffs are permanent or temporary.\n\n“What is the true intent and what does this all mean for America’s future, especially for small businesses?” said Ben Johnston, chief operating officer of Kapitus, a small business lender and marketplace. “The magnitude of these tariffs surprised me and most small business owners I know, as the markets are trying to find a floor. I don’t think anybody knows the real answer.”\n\nJohnston said small businesses, which employ nearly 50% of Americans working in the private sector and account for 40% of the nation’s gross domestic product, will be hit especially hard by the strain likely created by the tariffs. He said wholesalers, retailers and construction contractors heavily dependent on imported goods will probably take fewer risks in the new environment.\n\n“They know costs are going to rise, they are examining their supply chains and trying to determine what those tariffs will do to their margins and how they may have to pass off those costs to their customers,” Johnston said. “We’ve already seen consumer sentiment fall. Now we’re watching to see if any real hardship among small businesses lies ahead.”\n\n− Terry Collins\n\n'Nobody but me': Trump defends tariffs amid market swings\n\nTrump defended his massive tariffs as the stock market nosedived further, saying the U.S. has an “opportunity to reset the table on trade.”\n\n\"Nobody but me would do this,\" Trump said. \"You know, it's nice to serve a nice easy term, but we have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country.\"\n\nTrump also said his tariffs can remain permanent even though he’s engaging with Japan and other nations on negotiations.\n\n“They can both be true,” Trump said. “There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations because there’s things we need beyond tariffs.”\n\nWhat is a recession?\n\nA recession is informally considered at least two straight quarters of declining economic output. But the technical definition is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” according to the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe measure is based on employment, income, consumer spending and industrial production, among other criteria. An economic tailspin is typically accompanied by hundreds of thousands or millions of net job losses.\n\nWhat exactly is a recession? Economists say odds of one in the US are 'very high.'\n\nWhat is a stock market correction?\n\nCorrection territory is generally understood to mean a stock market indicator has dropped at least 10% from its recent market high. This is different from bear market territory, which refers to a stock market drop of 20% or more from a recent peak, or a closing high.\n\nEvery investment is susceptible to corrections. They can apply to individual stocks, bonds, or stock indexes such as the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq.\n\nSeveral things can prompt a correction including a change in economic policy, newly released jobs or inflation data and company earnings reports.\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/31/trump-tariffs-trade-negotiations-deadline-updates/85454113007/", "title": "Midnight deadline looms for countries facing Trump tariffs - USA Today", "text": "Updated July 31, 2025, 3:55 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump introduced last-minute stumbling blocks for several nations seeking reprieves on trade before his reciprocal tariffs begin to go into effect just after midnight.\n\nIrked by Canada's support for Palestinian statehood, India's purchases of Russian oil and Brazil's prosecution of its former president, Trump threatened to punish the nations with higher tariffs, regardless of whether the actions directly harm U.S. exports or exacerbate existing trade deficits.\n\nIn a Truth Social Post, the U.S. president linked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's announcement that his country would recognize Palestinian statehood to the negotiations with Ottawa to stop a 35% tariff from going into effect at 12:01 am ET on Aug. 1.\n\n\"Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine. That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh’ Canada!!!\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has made a flurry of deals with America's trading partners as his Aug. 1 deadline approaches, including agreements with South Korea and Pakistan and a trade pact with the European Union. Other countries that are currently paying a baseline tariff of 10% and have not entered into a separate arrangement with the United States may see their fees go up.\n\nHere's where Trump's tariffs and trade negotiations stand:\n\nTrump expected to sign executive order Thursday setting new tariffs\n\nTrump will sign an executive order during the afternoon or evening of July 31 setting the new tariff rates for countries around the world, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nTrump has already announced several of those rates, ranging from 50% on imports from Brazil to 15% tariffs on goods from several countries including South Korea and the European Union.\n\nIn April, Trump imposed a baseline 10% tariff that applied to most countries. Trump has said he is likely to raise the baseline to either 15% or 20% beginning Aug. 1. - Joey Garrison\n\nCountries to receive new tariff rates before midnight, White House says\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said countries that have not received notice of their new U.S. reciprocal tariff rates will be alerted by the administration before midnight Aug. 1.\n\n“Tomorrow, Aug. 1, the reciprocal rates will be going into effect,” Leavitt said during a July 31 briefing with reporters.\n\nTrump has pointed to Aug. 1 as the marker for higher reciprocal tariffs on goods from nearly 200 countries across the world to go into effect. Trump has already announced new tariff rates for several countries and reached deals with other nations, including Japan, Vietnam and the European Union, that includes their new tariff rates.\n\n“We’ve sent out 17 letters to countries around the world, and the rest those countries that either do not have a deal or have a letter, they will be hearing from this administration by the business deadline tonight,” Leavitt said. - Joey Garrison\n\nMexico trade deal extended for 90 days\n\nTrump says he's giving Mexico another 90 days to come to a longer term agreement with the United States to avoid higher tariffs.\n\nAfter speaking by phone to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, he said in a Truth Social post that he was extending existing tariffs on Mexico for 90 days, and possibly longer, while the countries continued to negotiate.\n\n\"The complexities of a Deal with Mexico are somewhat different than other Nations because of both the problems, and assets, of the Border,\" he said. \"We have agreed to extend, for a 90 Day period, the exact same Deal as we had for the last short period of time, namely, that Mexico will continue to pay a 25% Fentanyl Tariff, 25% Tariff on Cars, and 50% Tariff on Steel, Aluminum, and Copper.\"\n\nTrump said that Mexico also agreed to \"immediately terminate\" all of its non-tariff barriers, without providing further details on that part of the agreement.\n\n\"There will be continued cooperation on the Border as it relates to all aspects of Security, including Drugs, Drug Distribution, and Illegal Immigration into the United States,\" he said.\n\nMexico had been facing a 30% tariff on non-exempt goods. - Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump admin defends use of emergency power to impose tariffs in federal court\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs may be headed for some rocky legal terrain. U.S. appeals court judges indicated during oral arguments on July 31 that they were skeptical the president has the legal authority to impose tariffs without congressional approval.\n\nDepartment of Justice lawyer Brett Shumate argued in opening remarks that Trump should be able to continue using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping tariffs. \"But IEEPA has rarely been used, hasn't it,\" a judge immediately interjected.\n\nShumate said that since its inception in 1977, the statute has frequently been used by the government. \"This is the first time IEEPA has been used for tariffs,\" Shumate acknowledged.\n\nBut he said Trump's actions incorporated language that former President Richard Nixon used in 1971 to impose tariffs that were later upheld by the court, and Congress was aware of the case when it passed a law giving the U.S. president emergency powers. - Francesca Chambers/Reuters\n\nTrump cites Bolsonaro prosecution in Brazil tariff hike\n\nIn a July 30 executive order hiking tariffs on Brazil to 50%, he cited the nation's prosecution of former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, as a reason for higher import fees on some goods. The order moved an earlier deadline for the tariffs to go into effect to Aug. 6.\n\nHe said that Bolsonaro, who's charged with plotting a coup, had been \"politically persecuted.\" The administration also sanctioned the judge in the case in a separate action on the same day. - Francesca Chambers\n\nIndia in the crosshairs for Russian oil purchases\n\nTrump blasted India for purchasing Russian oil, which has helped to prolong Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine. He said in a social media post that he'd hit India with a 25% tariff.\n\nHe also took aim at the country's participation in the BRICS economic group. The club rivals the Group of Seven economic alliance for advanced economies and includes Russia, Brazil, China and South Africa.\n\nIn an overnight post on social media, Trump hit India again — and needled former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.\n\n\"I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World,\" Trump wrote. \"Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together. Let’s keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very dangerous territory!\"\n\nMedvedev had previously issued a sharp warning to Trump over his threats to put steep tariffs on purchasers Russian oil.\n\n\"Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with (Trump's) own country,\" the former Russian president said. - Francesca Chambers\n\nU.S. closes in on a China deal\n\nTrump's administration has continued negotiate with China, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a July 31 interview with CNBC that the United States' believes a deal is close at hand.\n\n\"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent said.\n\nBessent was expected to update Trump on the status of negotiations later in the day. China faces an Aug. 12 deadline to reach an agreement with the United States.\n\nThe tariffs will also face a key legal test this week as the U.S. Court of Appeals hears arguments in a case challenging Trump's authority to tap into emergency powers to impose unilateral tariffs.\n\n\"If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE “DEAD,” WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS,\" Trump said on social media ahead of oral arguments. - Francesca Chambers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/04/05/groceries-price-increase-trump-tariffs/82953625007/", "title": "Groceries prices could increase due to Trump's tariffs ... - USA Today", "text": "April 5, 2025, 8:01 p.m. ET\n\nAlthough President Donald Trump's self-proclaimed \"Liberation Day\" has passed, American grocery shoppers' wallets may soon feel the impact of the reciprocal tariffs imposed on several of the country's trade partners earlier this week.\n\nFood industry analyst Phil Lempert told NPR that \"probably almost half of the products in a supermarket − about 40,000 products − will be affected by these tariffs, whether it's the entire product or just an ingredient.\"\n\nThe goal of Trump's round of recent tariffs is to boost domestic manufacturing by making it more expensive for international companies to ship products into the U.S. On Wednesday, Trump and the White House announced the reciprocal tariffs against nations that charge fees to U.S. imports, with higher tariffs for what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called the \"Dirty 15,\" a reference to the 15% of countries with the largest trade surpluses and high tariff and non-tariff barriers, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Over the decades, they ripped us off like no country has never been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us, but it's substantial money for the country,\" Trump told reporters on March 30, per ABC News.\n\nThe reciprocal tariffs come after Trump decided to levy 20% tariffs on imports from China and 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada earlier this year. With inflation and tariffs severely affecting the U.S. economy, grocery shoppers may need to be more diligent in their couponing going forward.\n\nHere are some grocery items that could, and may not, see a price hike due to Trump's enacted reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWill avocadoes, other fruits be impacted?\n\nImpacts on fruit prices could be a mixed bag, with some tropical varieties from Central and South America likely to be affected, while others from our nearest neighbors − Canada and Mexico − escaping Trump's reciprocal tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. received 51% of its fresh fruit from Mexico, and 2% from Canada, in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Both countries were not on the White House and Trump's chart of nations facing reciprocal tariffs.\n\nSome other top sources of imported fruit include Guatemala, Costa Rica and Peru. All three countries are on the White House's chart and were given 10% reciprocal tariffs.\n\nGuatemala, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Honduras are the main exporters of bananas to the U.S., according to the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Guatemala also ships melons, plantains and papayas, USDA said, while Costa Rica exports pineapples, avocados and mangoes.\n\n\"These products don't have a long shelf life, and with the tariffs, we're going to face significant issues with both price and availability,\" Lempert said about fruit, per NPR.\n\nWhile some fruits could see an increase in cost, Avocadoes may not be one of them.\n\nAvocados are one of the Mexican food items that the U.S. will be able to continue importing tariff-free, Reuters reported. Of the fresh avocados the U.S. imports, 87.6% come from Mexico, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data as of Jan. 7.\n\nWill vegetable costs increase?\n\nApproximately 69% of America's fresh vegetables came from Mexico, and 20% from Canada, in 2022, according to the USDA.\n\n\"The United States receives fresh vegetables from more than 125 different countries, but most imports originate from Mexico and Canada,\" the USDA states.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2020, the volume of fresh vegetable imports to the U.S. rose nearly 200%, and the value of fresh vegetable imports grew to exceed fresh exports by $7.6 billion, more than double the same figure a decade earlier, according to the government agency.\n\nWhile vegetables from Mexico and Canada may not be impacted by the reciprocal tariffs, veggies from other countries on the White House chart − including Guatemala, Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Honduras, Morocco and China − could see an increase in cost.\n\nSeafood likely to become more expensive\n\nThe U.S. imports the vast majority of its seafood, up to 85%, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Due to this, and since several countries that supply fish and shellfish to the U.S. were among the hardest hit by tariffs, seafood will likely become more expensive going forward.\n\nChile, India, Indonesia and Vietnam are the largest suppliers of imported seafood, according to the USDA. All four countries are on the White House's chart, but Vietnam was hit with the highest tariffs at 46%, while Chile (10%), India (26%) and Indonesia (32%) followed behind.\n\n“About 70 to 80% of the U.S. seafood food supply is imported, and so that is not a number that the U.S. domestic industry can plug,” Andy Harig, vice president of tax, trade, sustainability and policy development at The Food Industry Association said, per Today. “So you’re going to see that the cost of the seafood department go up.”\n\nCoffee could become harder to buy\n\nThe U.S. is the world's largest importer of coffee, according to the USDA. About 80% of U.S. roasted imports come from Latin America, with more than 60% coming from just two countries — Brazil and Colombia, the agency said.\n\nBrazil and Colombia are both on the White House's chart, and they were both hit with 10% reciprocal tariffs.\n\nImported alcohol market 'likely to be clobbered'\n\nLempert said the imported alcohol market is likely \"to be clobbered\" due to the tariffs, according to NPR.\n\nAccording to USDA, the top import sources for wine include the European Union (France, Italy and Spain), New Zealand and Australia. The European countries were hit with 20% reciprocal tariffs, while New Zealand and Australia received 10% tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. imports most of its beer from Mexico and Canada, as well as the Netherlands and Ireland, which were both hit with 20% tariffs. Lempert added that beer sold in cans will also get doubly impacted due to tariffs on China and other aluminum producers.\n\nOlive oil prices could skyrocket\n\nEuropean Union, particularly Spain, Italy and Greece, are the top import sources for olive oil.\n\n\"Olive oil prices have gone through the roof,\" Lempert said, per NPR. \"They're going to go even higher.\"\n\nCertain cheeses imported from the European Union, especially Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, could see a price increase. Parmigiano-Reggiano, brie and Gouda are a few cheeses that may become costly.\n\nWhat grocery items may not increase in cost?\n\nSome grocery items that may not increase much, primarily because due to them being domestically produced, include beef and rice. While both these goods could remain relatively the same, they could raise a tad bit.\n\nAlthough 90% of beef consumed in the U.S. is domestically produced, tariffs could add to existing price increases that have raised costs to historic highs, and according to the USDA, the U.S. cattle herd is the smallest it's been since 1951.\n\nLike beef, rice sold in the U.S. is domestically produced, but nearly a third is imported, primarily jasmine rice from Thailand and basmati rice from India, the USDA states. Thailand and India are both on the White House chart.\n\nContributing: James Powel, Rachel Barber & Lori Comstock/ USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/08/us-uk-trade-deal-trump-announces-agreement/83508333007/", "title": "Recap: Trump announces US-UK trade deal with focus on steel ...", "text": "May 8, 2025 Updated May 9, 2025, 7:09 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump touted a “breakthrough trade deal” between the U.S. and United Kingdom as he announced the first agreement since he imposed sweeping tariffs in April that ignited a global trade war and rattled financial markets.\n\nJoined in the Oval Office by U.S. and UK officials who helped broker the agreement, Trump said the pact would boost trade between the two allies and remove \"non-tariff barriers\" he said \"unfairly discriminate\" against American products.\n\n“There could be no more perfect morning to reach this historic agreement,\" Trump said, noting that the agreement happened to fall on \"Victory Day\" in celebration of the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nYet it is unclear whether the deal with Britain ‒ the ninth largest trading partner with the U.S. ‒ will provide momentum for future trade agreements as the Trump administration seeks to rapidly hammer out deals with 170 countries. The U.S. has a $12 billion trade surplus with Britain, making it an outlier from other countries like China that export more goods to the U.S. than it imports.\n\nUnder the still-evolving deal, Trump kept a 10% baseline tariff on British products imported to the United States, but he said that's a \"low number\" compared to the tariffs he wants to maintain for other counties.\n\nThe agreement lowers 25% universal tariffs on automobiles from the UK to 10%, while the 25% rate still applies to vehicles from other countries. Trump also agreed to eliminate 25% tariffs on steel from the UK.\n\nOther details are still in the works, Trump said. Still, U.S. stocks traded higher in the immediate hours of the news spreading of a broad deal between the two longstanding global allies. Trump promised that their efforts would provide billions of dollars in access for U.S. agricultural products such as beef and ethanol.\n\n“They’re opening up their country,” Trump said. “Their country is a little closed and we appreciate it.”\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Keri Starmer was put on a speaker phone for the announcement and called it a “really fantastic, historic day” coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the key moment at the end of World War II.\n\n“This is going to boost trade between and across our countries,” Starmer siad.\n\nTrump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on a slew of countries April 2 but later paused most of them for 90 days, saying those nations' leaders were eager to negotiate trade deals. Since then administration officials repeatedly have said they are close to making deals.\n\nThe UK wasn't hit with a reciprocal tariff during Trump's April roll out, but faced a 10% universal tariff and 25% tariffs that Trump imposed on foreign automobiles, steel and aluminum.\n\nBritons will buy U.S. beef and chicken despite additives: Navarro\n\nPeter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, disputed concerns that growth additives would discourage sales of beef and chicken to the United Kingdom.\n\nKansas, Nebraska and Texas are expected to sell more beef, Navarro said of the trade deal President Donald Trump negotiated with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Wisconsin and California are expected to sell more dairy products, he said. Iowa is expected to sell more corn as ethanol, he said.\n\n“There’s joy in farm-ville today,” Navarro told reporters May 8.\n\nAsked if Britons would buy beef raised with hormones or chicken rinsed with chlorine, Navarro said the markets would decide. He argued that “so-called phytosanitary standards” are “simply a tool to suppress” fine agricultural products.\n\n“If more of that comes into the market and the British people don’t want to buy it, that’s one set of facts,” Navarro said. “We believe that once they’ve tasted American beef and chicken that they’d prefer to have it.” - Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: Reduced UK auto tariffs to help Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar cars\n\nPresident Trump said he made a special exception for the United Kingdom by lowering auto tariffs from 25% to 10% to help high-end vehicles such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar vehicles that are manufactured in Britain.\n\n“It's a very special car, and it's very limited number, too,” Trump said. “It’s not one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars. They make a very small number of cars that are super luxury.”\n\n“That’s really handmade stuff, they've been doing it for a long time in the same location,” he said. “So I said, ‘Let’s help the out with that one.’”\n\nTrump said he will “rarely” make the same decision in negotiations with other countries when it comes to other foreign automobiles. - Joey Garrison\n\nSchumer casts doubt on longevity of Trump’s UK trade deal\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cast doubt on the durability of President Donald Trump’s trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the details of which are not fully known.\n\nSchumer, D-New York, said in a morning Senate floor speech, ahead of Trump’s announcement, that the trade deal “is likely to be built on quicksand.”\n\n“And with this president, if past is prologue, who knows if this ‘deal’ will actually stick,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\n\nSchumer added: “It would be hard to take anything the president says about this deal today seriously, because in all likelihood he will likely change his mind again.” – Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump says 10% tariff could still increase for other countries\n\nTrump’s trade deal with the United Kingdom maintained a 10% universal tariff on the country.\n\nAsked if trade deals with other countries also could result in tariffs staying at 10%, rather than the higher reciprocal tariffs the president threatened last month before pausing most of them, Trump said no.\n\n“The template of 10 is probably the lowest,” he said, suggesting other countries could have a higher tariff. - Zac Anderson\n\nJames Bond cars, films at heart of trade discussions\n\nThe United Kingdom could begin sending more Aston Martin cars – the iconic ride for fictional spy James Bond – to the U.S. under the trade deal, but Trump said potential tariffs on foreign films were still open to discussion.\n\n“James Bond has nothing to worry about, that I can tell you,” Trump said to laughter in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump noted that he was friends with Sean Connery, the late Scottish actor who created the Bond character in film. Trump has two golf courses in Scotland, and Connery helped resolve a zoning dispute for the one in Aberdeen.\n\n“Sean Connery was a friend of mine. He was a great guy,” Trump said. “He said, ‘Let the bloody bloke build his golf courses.’” - Bart Jansen\n\nUK says trade deal with the US eliminates steel tariffs\n\nThe United Kingdom said in a press release that the trade deal with the United States will help a steel industry “on the brink of collapse.”\n\nThe U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on foreign steel. The UK won’t face those tariffs now, according to the release.\n\n“The Prime Minister negotiated the 25% tariff down to zero, meaning UK steelmakers can carry on exporting to the US,” the release states. - Zac Anderson\n\nTrump says he’s not overstating deal\n\nResponding to a question about the significance of the trade deal announced with the UK, Trump said it’s incorrect to suggest he’s overstating its importance.\n\n“This is a maxed out deal,” he said, adding: “It’s a very big deal right now but I think it’s going to grow.” - Zac Anderson\n\nU.S. keeps 10% tariffs on UK goods: Lutnick\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said 10% tariffs would remain under the trade deal, but that the United Kingdom was opening its markets for an estimated $5 billion in U.S. beef, ethanol and machinery.\n\nLutnick said a 25% U.S. tariff on automobiles would be reduced to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles. Lutnick also said a British airline would announce later May 8 that it would buy $10 billion of Boeing planes. - Bart Jansen and Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says UK has agreed to eliminate ‘non-tariff barriers’\n\nAlthough the details of the trade deal are still unclear, Trump said the United Kingdom has agreed to reduce or eliminate the number of “non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products.\"\n\n“This is now turning out, I think, really to be a great deal for both countries because it will be really great for the UK also,” Trump said.\n\nUK’s Starmer says deal will boost trade between countries\n\nUnited Kingdom Keir Starmer, talking through a speaker phone, touted the moment as a “fantastic, historic day” as the U.S. and Britain agreed to a trade deal.\n\n“Really important deal,” Starmer said. “This is going to boost trade across our countries. It's going to not only protect jobs, but create jobs, opening market access. And as you say, Donald, the timing couldn't be more apt.” - Joey Garrison\n\nTreasury sanctions 4 Chinese companies for buying, delivering Iranian oil\n\nIn another trade arena, the Treasury Department announced May 8 it sanctioned a Chinese refinery and three port terminal operators for buying or helping deliver hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian oil.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had signed an executive order to block sales of Iranian oil as part of an economic pressure campaign against the Middle East country working to develop its own nuclear weapon.\n\n“The United States remains resolved to intensify pressure on all elements of Iran’s oil supply chain to prevent the regime from generating revenue to further its destabilizing agenda,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. - Bart Jansen\n\nRubio calls trade deal ‘an important step’ toward more\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio praised the trade deal with the United Kingdom as “an important step towards fair and reciprocal trade” with other countries around the world.\n\n“Looking forward to the many great deals your administration will deliver for the American people!” Rubio wrote on social media. -Bart Jansen\n\nStocks up on word of trade deal\n\nU.S. stock markets rose in initial trading after Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 198.6 points or 0.48% at the opening of trading May 8. The S&P 500 rose 32.3 points or 0.57% in initial trading. And the Nasdaq composite rose 182 points or 1.03% at the opening bell. - Reuters\n\nThe United Kingdom is the ninth-largest trading partner with U.S.\n\nFinal details on Trump's trade deal with the United Kingdom remain under wraps.\n\nBut the two nations exchange a much smaller amount of goods and services – largely cars and chemicals heading to the U.S. – than the U.S. does with its largest trading partners.\n\nThe U.S. exported nearly $80 billion in goods and services in 2024, according to the Census Department, while importing about $68 billion. That ranks the United Kingdom ninth in trade with the U.S.Machinery and transport equipment was also the main goods exported from the United Kingdom to the U.S. in 2023. Cars represented nearly half the UK exports to the U.S., ahead of Germany and the Netherlands, according to that country’s trade office.\n\nChemical exports, mostly for pharmaceuticals, account for nearly one-quarter of the exports to the U.S. They were the second largest group of UK commodities exported to the U.S.\n\nThe United Kingdom figures are dwarfed by U.S. trade with Mexico at $839 billion in goods and serves exchanging across the U.S.-Mexico border last year. Canada traded $762 billion in goods and services with the U.S., while China coming in at $582 billion in trade with the U.S.\n\nTrump met with Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney on May 6, and talks are set to begin with China. - Bart Jansen\n\nU-Michigan economist: Not a major trade deal\n\nTrump’s announcement already is being met with skepticism.\n\nUniversity of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers told CNN he wouldn’t consider it a major trade deal, noting the United Kingdom only accounts for about 3% of U.S. trade.\n\n“The president’s a showman, he’s going to tell you there’s all sorts of wonderful things about it,” Wolfers said. - Zac Anderson\n\nTrump: 'We don't have to sign deals'\n\nTrump commented about the intense interest in the trade deals during a May 6 meeting with the prime minister of Canada.\n\n\"Everyone says: 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?\" Trump said. \"We don't have to sign deals. We could sign 25 deals right now . . . if we wanted. We don't have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market.\"\n\nThe president also expressed frustration with the constant questions. \"I wish they'd stop asking how many deals are you signing this week,\" he said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers during a May 6 committee hearing that deals could be signed soon.\n\n\"I would think that perhaps as early as this week we will be announcing trade deals with some of our largest trading partners,\" Bessent said. - Zac Anderson\n\nWhat's the status of U.S.-China trade talks?\n\nThere are 18 countries that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as \"major trading partners.\" He said negotiations have begun with all of them except China, but talks between U.S. and Chinese officials are now scheduled.\n\nBessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are traveling to Switzerland on May 8, where they will meet with China's \"lead representative on economic matters.\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is also meeting on May 8 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Jinping told Putin their two countries should be \"friends of steel\", as they pledged to boost cooperation to a new level at a time of heightened confrontation with the West.\n\nAt talks in the Kremlin, the two leaders cast themselves as defenders of a new world order no longer dominated by the United States. - Reuters/Zac Anderson\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2025/03/04/trump-tariffs-auto-industry-impact/81399379007/", "title": "Experts: Auto industry can tolerate Trump tariffs for just a few weeks", "text": "March 4, 2025, 3:29 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump's 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico are expected to have a significant impact on the auto industry.\n\nExperts predict that the tariffs will lead to higher consumer prices, job losses, and potential closures of auto parts suppliers.\n\nIndustry leaders are urging the Trump administration to reconsider the tariffs and seek alternative solutions to address trade concerns.\n\nExperts predict that while the immediate impact might be muted due to existing inventory, the effects will become profound within weeks, leading to price hikes for consumers.\n\nThe tariffs threaten Michigan's economy, potentially causing job losses, supplier closures, and a recession if they remain in effect for an extended period.\n\nWhile some argue that tariffs could bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., others warn of severe consequences for the auto industry and consumers alike.\n\nThe auto industry can withstand only a few weeks of President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico until costs to automakers and suppliers rise astronomically, resulting in higher consumer prices and risking massive job losses, experts said Tuesday.\n\nThe industry reacted to Trump's move at midnight to put 25% tariffs — the taxes paid on products when they cross international borders — on goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump also increased tariffs on goods from China by another 10% on top of the 10% he enacted last month. Trump said the moves will push manufacturers to build more things in the United States.\n\nThe industry cannot quickly end foreign production and stand up domestic factories, with billions invested in long-term product cycles. In addition, U.S. automakers get a number of components for domestic assembly from Canada, Mexico and China. On top of that, the Detroit Three each build vehicles in Canada and Mexico that they sell in the United States. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors build vehicles in China that they sell in the states.\n\nThe tariffs mean the industry has weeks to figure out how to mitigate any production disruptions and absorb any increased costs before things really go off the rails, experts said.\n\n\"The tariffs will have a hugely negative impact on the auto industry and the economy as a whole,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights. \"In the immediate future, the impact will be somewhat muted because of the inventory that's already in the pipeline that hasn't been subjected to the tariffs. But once we get past a few weeks, the effects will start to get quite profound even for vehicles that are assembled in the U.S.\"\n\nProfits won't cover added costs\n\nThat's because the auto industry doesn't have the profit margins to fully absorb the extra 25% in costs, most of which will have to be passed on to consumers, Abuelsamid said.\n\n\"There are as many as 30,000 individual parts that go into a modern vehicle, with many of those ultimately crossing borders multiple times before a finished vehicle rolls off the assembly line,\" Abuelsamid said. \"From raw materials to increasingly complex subassemblies and then the final vehicle, each time something crosses the border, a tariff is assessed and paid by the importer, not the country that is exporting the product.\"\n\nHe added: \"For example, Ford will pay tariffs on gas V8 engines it brings in from Windsor and diesel V8s from Mexico that it puts into F-Series trucks. While those trucks are built in Dearborn, Kansas City and Louisville, those engines represent a significant portion of the value of the vehicle and there will be price increases to offset the tariffs on those engines and other components.\"\n\nWall Street realized this potential impact on the automakers and reacted Tuesday by selling stock in the Detroit Three. GM's stock price by early afternoon had plummeted by 3.1%, Ford was down 2% and Stellantis — the maker of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat brands — saw its stock price tumble 4.5%.\n\nJob losses, supplier closures, recession outlook\n\nThe consensus among most experts is that costs will rise immediately, but manufacturers will absorb the added costs for a month or two.\n\n\"After that, consumers will likely see a 5% to 10% rise in prices,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions. \"If cooler heads prevail, this first round will be over before April.\"\n\nJeff Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said estimates that the tariffs would increase vehicle prices by up to $12,000 will have an impact.\n\n“That’s got to reduce demand for those vehicles from U.S. consumers because that’s too big a bite to bear in the pocketbook,” he said. “The big question is the duration of the tariffs and whether the tariffs will be extended to other countries.”\n\nEdmunds.com data showed that the average transaction price for a new vehicle in January 2025 was $48,118 and for a used car was $24,402.\n\nBeyond an affordability crisis is the fact that the auto industry is a pivotal part of the economy. It pumps $1.2 trillion a year into U.S. economy, making up about 5% of the gross domestic product. It also accounts for 10.1 million American jobs, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.\n\nAbuelsamid's firm projects that many auto parts suppliers, especially smaller companies, cannot afford to absorb the tariffs, relocate their facilities or to split their efforts across two or three countries. Therefore, many may end up going bankrupt in the coming months and years, he said.\n\nPut bluntly, Abuelsamid said, \"My projection is that we will see about a 1.5 million to 2 million unit annual reduction in sales in the U.S. for each year the tariffs are in effect. This will in turn lead to the likely loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs across the automotive ecosystem and into the wider economy that depends on people in the industry spending their wages. If the tariffs persist for any length of time, I expect it to lead to a recession within a year and an increase in unemployment.\"\n\nA 'mini disaster for the automotive industry'\n\nAutomakers, battery makers and suppliers are investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and to modernize the industrial base, said John Bozzella, CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation in a statement.\n\n\"But it’s worth remembering the sheer scale of the industry and the size of these automotive and advanced manufacturing facilities,\" Bozzella said. \"They’re massive. You just can’t relocate automotive production and the supply chain overnight.\"\n\nHe noted that auto tariffs in North America could end up increasing costs on consumers before jobs come back to the country.\n\nWall Street analysts are counting on the tariffs being in place for weeks rather than months.\n\n\"If these tariffs stay in place for longer than six months, we estimate on average a $4,000 to $5,000 increase in car prices,\" said Dan Ives, global head of technology research and managing director at Wedbush Securities. \"Ford has limited flexibility to move its manufacturing footprint and GM gets hit, but not as bad as Ford. It's a mini disaster in the making for the auto industry if it continues.\"\n\nErik Gordon, University of Michigan Ross School of Business professor, believes the tariffs will be short unless \"either country makes a false move.\" Gordon said, noting that Trump doesn't want to follow the usual international negotiation path that takes years to get an agreement to change.\n\n\"Traditionally, most of the time is spent on foot dragging by the country that doesn't want a change and on visits with lavish dinners, announcements of significant progress, but no actual progress,\" Gordon said. \"The president wants fast, real progress. If he sees it, he will let up on the pressure, but if Mexico or Canada try the usual foot dragging or engage in anti-U.S. rhetoric or retaliation, he will be more likely to increase the pressure than decrease it.\"\n\nMichigan's economic viability at stake\n\nBeyond these tariffs, Trump has said he intends to impose tariffs \"in the neighborhood of 25%\" on imported autos and similar tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports, according to Reuters. He has said the levies on vehicles would come as soon as April 2.\n\nThe Detroit Three directed the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, to a comment by the American Automotive Policy Council on their behalf. In the statement, council President Matt Blunt cited the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiated during Trump's first term: “We continue to believe that vehicles and parts that meet the USMCA’s stringent domestic and regional content requirements should be exempt from the tariff increase.\"\n\nThe purpose of the USMCA was to create what Trump considered a more balanced trade arrangement than the North American Free Trade Agreement reached in the 1990s.\n\n\"Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market,” Blunt said.\n\nMichAuto, the state’s only automotive and mobility association, said the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico threaten Michigan's business climate and represent a \"bad-faith\" trade policy.\n\n\"Unilaterally imposing tariffs before United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement renegotiations even begin will undermine diplomatic processes and risk damaging Michigan’s relationships with its closest trading partners,\" said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto and vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives for the Detroit Regional Chamber.\n\nIn a statement to the Free Press, Stevens said, \"As MichAuto has continued to advise, the tariffs’ harmful effects will extend beyond trade relationships and will cause businesses to purchase and produce fewer products, hire fewer employees and increase prices to the detriment of consumers. Michigan’s economic viability and business attractiveness will be reduced to collateral damage.\"\n\nStevens urged the Trump administration and policymakers to prioritize \"constructive engagement over punitive measures\" which will damage state and nationwide businesses and consumers, he said.\n\nSimilarly, the American International Automobile Dealers Association CEO Cody Lusk said Tuesday in a statement that dealers and their customers are already reeling from rising car and parts prices, high interest rates and insurance costs, and the new tariffs pose an additional challenge to affordability.\n\n\"Tariffs can play an important role in balancing trade relationships and ensuring national security, but increasing barriers to trade also puts added pressure on the wallets of American families,\" Lusk said. \"In this case, tariffs could directly contribute to thousands of extra dollars on sticker prices. AIADA’s 9,400 members, seeking to protect their customers and their 560,000 American employees, urge our leaders and our trading partners to come together to negotiate a swift and practical end to these tariffs.”\n\nAutos Drive America, a group that represents international automakers who are in the United States, also addressed the issue of affordability for car buyers.\n\nJennifer Safavian, CEO of Autos Drive America, said in a statement, \"We are disappointed the U.S., Mexico and Canada could not reach a solution to avoid tariffs, which will undermine North American supply chains and cause costs to rise for U.S. auto manufacturers, and ultimately, the consumer. We urge the three countries to find a swift resolution that maintains the strength of the North American auto manufacturing sector.”\n\nThe UAW is the outlier, believing that tariffs will benefit the industry, at least the autoworkers in the industry.\n\n\"Corporations have been driving a non-stop race to the bottom by killing good blue-collar jobs in America to go exploit some poor worker in another country by paying poverty wages,\" the union said in a statement. \"Tariffs are a powerful tool in the toolbox for undoing the injustice of anti-worker trade deals. We are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class.\"\n\nThe union is in active talks with the Trump administration, it said, to end the \"free trade disaster.\"\n\n\"There’s been a lot of talk of these tariffs 'disrupting' the economy,\" the union's statement read. \"But if corporate America chooses to price-gouge the American consumer or attack the American worker because they don’t want to pay their fair share, corporate America bears the blame for that decision.\"\n\nFarley: 'It's a devastating impact'\n\nFord leadership has been at the forefront trying to educate the Trump administration on the damage that will be done to the auto industry if any long-term tariffs are enacted against Canada and Mexico. Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford has said he has had phone conversations with the president on the topic and felt confident that Trump understands the ramifications and wants a strong American manufacturing base.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley was blunt about it last month during a talk at an investor conference.\n\n\"Let's be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we've never seen,\" Farley said at the Wolfe Research Auto, Auto Tech and Semiconductor Conference held in New York on Feb. 11.\n\nDuring Ford's fourth-quarter earnings call with investors days before that, Farley told Wall Street the automaker could withstand tariffs if they are short-term.\n\n“In the weeks scenario we’re in good shape, if it’s a number of weeks,\" Farley said in early February. \"With changing our stock level of our components, both ourselves and to our suppliers, and changing our manufacturing patterns in both Mexico, especially, and the U.S, we can make sure nothing crosses the border for a couple of weeks. We have good stock situation with our dealers right now.\"\n\nFarley said more than 80% of Ford's vehicles are made in the United States, all of its transmissions are made here and more than half of the engines, too.\n\nThe problem is Ford has no excess capacity at its plants to shift production from plants outside the states to the United States, he said.\n\n\"Our teams in the U.S. are flat-out already,\" Farley said. \"So we would have to make some major strategy shifts in the U.S., build new plants, et cetera if this persists. Obviously, it’s a devastating impact.”\n\nA key point to the tariffs that Farley has repeatedly pointed out is the fact that South Korea-based automaker Hyundai-Kia is importing 600,000 vehicles a year into the United States with no incremental tariff and Japan-based Toyota also imports 500,000 vehicles into the country annually with no incremental tariffs.\n\n“If we’re going to have tariff policy that lasts for a month or whatever it’s going to be, years, it better be comprehensive for our industry,” Farley said. “We can’t just cherry pick one place or another. This is a bonanza for our import competitors.”\n\nCar companies face decisions\n\nFarley’s assessments are not \"overly dramatic,\" said David Whiston, autos analyst at Morningstar.\n\n\"Before NAFTA, there was APTA done in 1965 by LBJ, which had free trade for the U.S. and Canadian auto industries, so 60 years of free trade has been blown up instantly,\" Whiston said. \"Supply chains are interwound across all three nations, so the automakers can’t just quickly move all the production to satisfy U.S. demand to U.S. plants. It takes time and billions of dollars.\"\n\nWhiston said it's hard to say how long the industry will wait before it makes massive investments in new facilities, but he believes the industry is probably waiting and hoping for an agreement on fentanyl and immigration issues before it has to make that call.\n\nStill, there remains the imposed a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States with no exceptions or exemptions and the threat of 25% tariffs on all imported autos coming on April 2.\n\n\"On the April 2 ones, no one knows yet if there will be a USMCA carveout exemption or if Canadian/Mexican made vehicles would be exempt from the April 2 ones since the March 4 ones are now in effect,\" Whiston said.\n\nAccording to data from Edmunds.com, through February, 48.6% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. were built in the United States, 17.4% were built in Mexico, 7.4% in Canada and 26.5% in other countries.\n\nDavid Soberman, a professor of marketing at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, called the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration “very unfortunate” and said it be would hard on both the Canadian and U.S economies.\n\n“It is already causing a lot of instability in the stock market. I believe it will fuel inflation in the U.S. It is important to remember that it is Americans who have to pay Donald Trump’s tariffs if they continue to buy Canadian goods,” Soberman said.\n\nAsked about the impact on the auto industry in both countries, Soberman pointed “especially” to GM, Ford and Stellantis and their key parts and components suppliers.\n\n“Since 1965, when the two countries signed an Auto Pact, the industries in both countries are integrated, almost like there isn’t a border,” he said.\n\nU-M's Gordon noted that carmakers have had more than a month to stockpile inventory from Canada and Mexico, but probably can't go longer than 30 days without facing shortages that could interrupt production of certain models. For now, he said, buyers will still have lots of cars to choose from, but not every model.\n\n\"Car companies have to decide how to rearrange U.S. production capacity for an unknown length of time because they don't know how long the tariffs will last or how high they will end up being,\" Gordon said. \"That won't be easy. They already projected EV demand inaccurately and got whipsawed. They are not looking forward to getting whipsawed on tariffs.\"\n\nAlliance for Automotive Innovation's Bozzella holds out hope that Trump understands the importance of a healthy and globally competitive auto industry and will reverse course.\n\n\"He’s stressed his commitment to the industry and auto workers during the campaign and since the inauguration,\" Bozzella said. \"We look forward to working with the administration on solutions that achieve the president’s goals, keep the industry competitive and in a position to support the country’s economic and national security in the years ahead.”\n\nEric D.

But many economists warn that consumers should get ready to pay more for some things as soon as summer.\n\nSo maybe it isn't a bad idea to start thinking about back-to-school shopping even before summer vacation begins.\n\nSome shoppers might want to keep an eye on Memorial Day sales to knock some gifts off a Christmas list. Sure, it sounds strange. But it's one more weird twist in the new economic realities associated with much higher tariffs in 2025 on many goods that consumers buy.\n\nSpikes in shoe prices could get people talking\n\nCan we expect to see price hikes of 15% or more on shoes or a sweater? Maybe.\n\nIf so, we could be talking about the kind of consumer indignation we saw when egg prices soared. Eggs are up 18% over the last four months or 49% in a year, according to Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at The Budget Lab at Yale University.\n\nPrice hikes related to tariffs are not showing up yet in many goods, like clothing, because the items aren't perishable and retailers continue to sell some \"pre-tariff inventory,\" Tedeschi told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nBut consumers can expect big price spikes to hit clothing and shoes this year, according to the latest forecast from the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan research center that provides analysis of federal policy proposals for the U.S. economy.\n\nShoe prices are expected to be 15% higher and apparel prices are expected to be 14% higher in the short run, according to the Budget Lab. And those prices could increase more in the long run.\n\nThe report issued May 12 estimated the effects of all U.S. tariffs and foreign retaliation implemented in 2025 through May 12, including the effects of the lower rates with China, the deal with the United Kingdom, and the auto tariff relief that could apply to automakers.\n\nRight now, it's hard to judge whether we'll see a flood of price hikes at every store or shortages on the shelf.\n\n\"We saw during the avian flu crisis that not all grocery stores hiked egg prices,\" Tedeschi said. \"Some simply chose to run out of eggs. So, price rises in the end might look less painful than some feared, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that consumers haven’t been hurt in other ways.\"\n\nOverall, we could see an average per household consumer loss of $2,800, the Budget Lab reported, as a result of higher tariffs. The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 1.7% in the short run.\n\nTariffs are viewed by economists as regressive taxes. How much individual households will actually see their real incomes, or after-tax incomes, fall will vary based on their spending patterns and what tradeoffs a consumer is willing to make, such as substituting a brand that didn't face a price hike.\n\nHow soon will some prices go up?\n\nExactly when we'll pay higher prices on individual items will vary. Some prices on some items could go up anywhere from a week to a couple of months.\n\n\"When the United States imposed tariffs on Chinese washing machines in January 2018,\" Tedeschi said, \"consumer washing machine prices didn’t rise until April that year, due to a combination of retailer inventory and supply chain lags.\"\n\nHallmark surprised those who collect Keepsake ornaments by advising customers that they will pay more than the listed price in the 2025 Dream Book, which was handed out at stores in April. Prices were raised in early May.\n\nIn a statement sent to the Free Press, Hallmark said: \"We are committed to maintaining fair pricing across our portfolio and are fortunate to manufacture 75% of our core products in our Kansas-based manufacturing facilities, including greeting cards and gift wrap.\" But Hallmark acknowledged that it \"made the necessary decision to adjust pricing on select imported products from our gift and ornament collections that are impacted by the current economic climate.\"\n\nOn May 15, Walmart said it would have to start raising prices on many goods later in May and June to address higher costs associated with tariffs. Already, the company said, the price of bananas at Walmart rose to 54 cents a pound, up from 50 cents, thanks to higher tariffs.\n\nThe Budget Lab analyzed the May 12 tariff rates as if they stayed in effect in perpetuity. We all know the tariff story remains ongoing.\n\nAs of May 12, the U.S. and China agreed to a temporary reduction in tariffs for 90 days, as negotiations continue.\n\n\"The May 12 changes to the China rate alone reduce the negative economic impact of all 2025 tariffs to date by 40%,\" according to the Budget Lab.\n\nEven so, the Trump trade war has meant that U.S. consumers still face an overall average effective tariff rate of 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to the estimates from the Budget Lab. Without the lower China tariffs — but with a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. and newly proposed auto rebates — the average effective tariff rate would have been 27.6%.\n\nShould you rush to buy to avoid tariffs?\n\nConsumers could have a bit of calculating to do when it comes to how much they might be willing to buy early and how willing they might be to hold off shopping.\n\n\"The problem with trying to bulk purchase items in a time of uncertainty is that many other consumers are doing it, too,\" Tedeschi said.\n\n\"This increase in demand can itself lead to the very higher prices consumers are trying to avoid.\"\n\nHe added that it is substantially uncertain where China tariffs in particular are going to end up over the summer.\n\n\"It’s easy to imagine them rising or falling from the current 30%,\" Tedeschi said.\n\n\"That said, if there are significant tariffs on China still in place this summer, it’s highly likely they will put upward pressure on apparel and electronics prices for back-to-school shopping.\"\n\nHis advice: Don’t panic buy. Take more time to research and comparison shop, including researching import content for potential large purchases like appliances and cars.\n\nAnd he said: \"Pay attention to the news and the data; ignore the noise and the vibes.\"\n\nDolls, microwaves and more to see price hikes\n\nOver the next few months, experts say, consumers could experience sticker shock when they shop for a long list of items. Tariffs are not just about higher prices on many cars or trucks.\n\nJason Miller, who keeps a close eye on inventories as an associate professor of logistics in the department of supply chain management at Michigan State University's Eli Broad College of Business, noted that there's lag between when products are imported and when they hit store shelves.\n\nBut he expects that price tags on many goods will start reflecting the impact of tariffs by June and July.\n\nConsumers, he said, likely will see price hikes on clothing and apparel; footwear; toys and games; and small electrical appliances, including microwaves, toasters and mixers.\n\nPrice hikes, he said, might also be expected for various household items for bathrooms, including items made of plastic; children's car seats and strollers, and some types of furniture.\n\nFor items like toys, Miller said, percentage increases in the double-digit range seem probable. The same's true, he said, with car seats and strollers currently.\n\nAll are items where China plays a major role in exporting goods to the United States.\n\nThe Toy Association, which has more than 900 members, is urging the U.S. government to grant a reprieve from tariffs on toys imported from China to make sure toys available for the holiday season. The Toy Association wants U.S. leaders to secure \"zero for zero\" tariffs on toys through bilateral negotiations with trading partners.\n\nTrump famously stated: \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls.\" And Trump added: \"Maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"\n\nThe New York Post ran a Page One cover May 1 declaring: \"Skimp on the Barbie.\"\n\nMiller doesn't expect many supply chain snarls in the weeks ahead, as a rush of imports into the United States is expected now.\n\n\"The biggest unknown now,\" Miller said, \"is what happens with the remaining reciprocal tariffs ... at the end of the 90-day July pause.\"\n\n\"The other unknown,\" Miller said, \"is what happens to domestic demand for manufacturing.\" Regional Federal Reserve Bank manufacturing surveys showed significant weakening of new orders in the past few months, especially in April, including upward pressure on the cost of imported materials and supplies.\n\nAs of May 13, a 10% tariff on goods entering the U.S. is to stay in place but, according to Reuters, U.S. officials remain in talks with several countries to lower additional tariffs imposed by Trump. The 10% tariff was imposed on nearly all countries by Trump on April 2.\n\nInflation isn't bad now\n\nConsumers saw inflation hit a four-year low, as the consumer price index rose year-over-year by 2.3% in April, according to the May 13 report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nPrices fell on some items in April, including airline tickets, used cars and trucks.\n\nUsed car and truck prices were down 0.5% month over month in April, following a 0.7% drop in March. Year-over-year used vehicle prices were up 1.5% in April.\n\nGasoline prices were down 0.1% month over month, following a 6.3% drop in March and a 1% decline in February. Gas prices were down 11.8% over 12 months through April, according to the Labor Department.\n\nPNC Chief Economist Gus Faucher noted in his report that consumers saw little indication in the April CPI report of tariffs causing higher goods prices. But he warned that tariffs are likely to drive prices and inflation up over the next few months.\n\n\"Even with the recent agreement between the Trump administration and China to reduce the most onerous import taxes, tariffs against all U.S. trading partners are much higher than they were at the beginning of 2025,\" Faucher said.\n\nDiane Swonk, KPMG's chief economist, noted in a report: \"This could be the last benign inflation report for a while.\"\n\nMake no mistake, consumers and business remain extremely uncertain about what's next when it comes to tariffs.\n\nOn May 8, for example, major footwear manufacturer Wolverine Worldwide stated in its earnings report that it would not provide a full-year 2025 outlook as a result of \"uncertainty around tariffs and related macro-economic conditions.\" The company, which is based in Rockland, also then said that it is withdrawing its 2025 guidance issued on Feb. 19.\n\nWolverine Worldwide stated in its footnotes that risk factors ahead include price increases, risks associated with foreign sourcing, tariffs, as well as economic conditions, such as inflationary pressures, employment rates and interest rates.\n\nWolverine Worldwide shoe brands include Merrell, Saucony, Hush Puppies, Chaco and Stride Rite. Wolverine Worldwide is also the global footwear licensee of the Cat and Harley-Davidson brands.\n\nWhat will happen next when it comes to tariffs?\n\nHow much of the higher tariffs will be passed along directly to consumers remains unknown — and we don't know just yet where tariffs will end up.\n\n\"The recent de-escalation with China to lower tariffs from 145% to 30% for 90 days is welcome news,\" according to an economic outlook issued May 13 by KPMG.\n\n\"That will help to restart trade between the two countries, but it is unclear whether tariffs will rise or drop at the end of the pause.\"\n\nThe KPMG report indicated that the Federal Reserve \"is not expected to cut rates until December due to a bout of stagflation, a period of rising inflation coupled with escalating unemployment.\"\n\nWe've not dealt with the troubling mix of a sluggish economy and high inflation at the same time since the 1970s.\n\n\"Uncertainty is just off the charts,\" said Charles Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University.\n\nEven the tariffs under the 90 day pause, he said, are much more restrictive than what was in place months ago.\n\n\"Trade barriers were very low when President Trump took office. He has contended again and again that other countries put up severe barriers to American exports. There is very little truth to that,\" Ballard said.\n\nSome cases exist, he said, such as Canadian tariffs on dairy products. \"But for the most part, we had low tariffs on imports from other countries, and other countries had low tariffs on our exports.\"\n\nOverall, though, he said, American businesses are feeling whiplash as the expected tariffs have changed quickly in 2025.\n\nDoes a company go ahead and place an order, Ballard asked, knowing that it may face a very different tariff when it is filled from what it faces now?\n\nBaby strollers, baby car seats, cellphones, laptops and toys, he said, are some of the items that face the greatest uncertainty.\n\nShopping for back-to-school or Christmas now might be a good idea, Ballard said, if you're concerned about shortages or higher prices.\n\n\"But it’s very hard to predict exactly where the prices will be, because we don’t know what the policy will be in the future,\" Ballard said.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

The income threshold is adjusted each year.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that during the 2021 filing season — which covered earnings for the 2020 tax year — only 4% of eligible taxpayers used the program. Instead, most people used a commercial website outside of the program, which may have charged taxpayers.\n\nA ProPublica investigation in 2019 detailed how TurboTax and H&R Block, both former participants in Free File, limited the program's reach by making free options more difficult to find online and instead figuring out a way to steer eligible taxpayers into products that weren't free.\n\nYou'd need to go to IRS.gov/freefile and search for the software that covers where you live and your personal situation. The IRS Free File program has a \"choose a trusted partner\" tool to help you find an offer that best meets your needs.\n\nThe IRS Free File's online guided tax software products are available to taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024.\n\nAs part of this partnership, tax preparation and filing software partners offer their online products to eligible taxpayers for free through Free File.\n\nYou won’t get the Free File free service if you go directly to a company’s website; you need to start at IRS.gov. The program sends you directly to the IRS partner’s website to create an account. You'd prepare and file your federal tax return. You'll get an email when the IRS has accepted your return.\n\nTaxpayers at any income level can use the Free File Fillable Forms starting Jan. 27.\n\nThis year, eight private-sector partners will provide online guided tax software products. And one partner will offer a product in Spanish.\n\nFor 2025, the participants in IRS Free File are: 1040Now, Drake (1040.com), ezTaxReturn.com, FileYourTaxes.com, On-Line Taxes, TaxAct, TaxHawk (FreeTaxUSA), and TaxSlayer.\n\nFor 2025, ezTaxReturn.com will provide an IRS Free File product in Spanish.\n\nA key point: You can only file your current year tax return using IRS Free File. You cannot process a prior year return using IRS Free File.\n\nAnother tip: If you used IRS Free File last year, you would receive an email from the same company that you used, welcoming you back to their official IRS Free File services. The email must include a link to the company’s IRS Free File site and explain how to file with it. If you choose this email link and qualify, you will not be charged for preparation and e-filing of a federal tax return.\n\nSome Free File programs will offer to allow you to prepare your state income tax return for free; but others don't and will charge a fee. You'd need to read the details of any offer.\n\nThe Free File program is one of many options for taxpayers.\n\n“Taxpayers have multiple filing choices, including trusted tax professionals, tax software, Free File, Direct File or free preparation services through IRS partners,\" said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel in a statement.\n\nThe IRS is promising that many residents in 25 states — but not Michigan — will be able to use a new, free \"Direct File\" program when they're filing their state and federal income taxes this year.\n\nMore than 30 million tax filers in half the country are expected to qualify. The states where the new system is expected to be up and running this year are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

This depends on income, filing status and age. If you make more than the IRS' minimum income threshold for your filing status (married, single, filing jointly, etc.), you have to file taxes.\n\nPeople with \"special situations\" also may have to file a tax return, regardless of income. A few examples include high income taxpayers, household employment taxes, self-employment net earnings of at least $400 or wages of $108.28 or more from a church exempt from employer FICA taxes.\n\nSee the full list: Who has to pay \"special taxes,\" what the income thresholds are\n\nWhat are the 2022 US federal tax brackets?\n\nA tax bracket is a range of incomes subject to a particular income tax rate. The IRS adjusts tax brackets every year to account for inflation, so the threshold for each of the seven tax brackets increased from 2021 to 2022. The IRS has already released tax brackets for this year that will be filed in 2024 based on average annual chained consumer price index from August 2021 to 2022, a period of historically high inflation.\n\nFile taxes early for a chance to double your refund money\n\nTax preparer Jackson Hewitt is hosting a weekly \"Double Your Refund\" sweepstakes this tax season, awarding 40 winners a matched cash prize equivalent to the value of their federal tax refund.

Does my state have state income tax?\n\nIncome tax is a tax on income that goes toward public services, government obligations and providing goods for the public.

It is generally imposed by the state\n\nBusiness tax: Tax applied to corporations, small businesses and the self-employed by subtracting operating and capital expenses from total income\n\nState income tax: Most states have income tax, but Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennesee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming do not.

The two mileage rates for 2022 are 58.5 cents per mile from January to June and 62.5 cents per mile from July to December.\n\nSo who can take a mileage deduction? This standard mileage rate applies to employees who are reimbursed by the federal government or businesses for out-of-pocket mileage expenses. Taxpayers who are members of the armed forces on active duty can also claim a deduction for moving expenses. Self-employed individuals can also claim business mileage on a tax return.\n\nBest way to receive 2023 tax refund\n\nOpening an account to receive electronic payments is the easiest way for Americans to receive their 2023 tax refund, the IRS says. With eight out of 10 taxpayers opting for direct deposit, IRS encourages the electronic method because \"there's no chance of it going uncashed, getting lost, stolen or destroyed.\"\n\nTo do this, select \"direct deposit\" on your tax software and type in the account and routing number associated with your bank account. If you're using a tax preparer, tell them you want direct deposit.\n\nHow much is the 2023 Child Tax Credit?\n\nThe maximum tax credit per qualifying child is $2,000 for ages 5 and under and $3,000 for ages 6-17.

A total of 7.65% of your gross wages goes to federal taxes, 6.2% to Social Security and 1.45% to Medicare. Your employer matches these percentages.\n\nSelf-employed individuals pay double the typical payroll tax because they don't have a larger employer to match it. The total tax rate is 15.3%, with 12.4% going to Social Security and 2.9% to Medicare.\n\nWhat's Tesla's tax credit for 2023?\n\nBecause the Inflation Reduction Act carves out a tax perk for those who buy electric and fuel cell vehicles, Tesla owners may be eligible for over $7,000 in tax credits. Tesla has several qualifying models, but they must have been bought on or after Jan. 1, 2023 and manufactured in North America.

What you need to know", "text": "Jan. 4, 2025, 6:06 a.m. ET\n\nThe 2025 tax season deadline for Americans to file is April 15.\n\nTaxpayers who earned more than $5,000 on payment apps in 2024 will receive a new 1099-K form.\n\nThe IRS began accepting tax filings in late January in previous years.\n\nA new year can mean many new, exciting things. But it also means that tax season is just around the corner.\n\nSoon Americans will have to do the yearly task of filing their tax returns for the previous year. For some, it's a walk in the park, but for many others, it can be overwhelming and stressful.\n\nThe tax code for 2025 has some changes that are noteworthy for Americans that could impact the size of their tax refund, and possibly the size of their headache.\n\nHere is what you need to know about the 2025 tax filing season.\n\nWhen does the 2025 tax season start?\n\nTax season typically starts around the end of January.\n\nBut that does not mean you can’t get started on your tax filing now. The Internal Revenue Service opens up its tax software before the start of tax season to allow people to begin preparing their returns. The IRS has also published a list of tips to help make the tax filing process easier.\n\nWhen is the 2025 tax deadline?\n\nAccording to the IRS, this year's deadline will fall on the traditional date of April 15.\n\nWhen has tax season started in past years?\n\nIRS records show that tax filing season has normally started in the last week of January, here is a list of start dates for the past 10 years.\n\n2024: Jan. 29\n\n2023: Jan. 23\n\n2022: Jan. 24\n\n2021: Feb. 12\n\n2020: Jan. 31\n\n2019: Feb. 2\n\n2018: Feb. 2\n\n2017: Jan. 27\n\n2016: Feb. 2\n\n2015: Jan. 30\n\nWhat changes are in place for the 2025 tax code?\n\nIn 2025 taxpayers who have received more than $5,000 through online marketplaces or payment apps like Venmo, Zelle, Google Wallet, or other services will get a new form called the 1099-K.\n\nAccording to the IRS, the form is only sent to people who use the payment apps for selling goods or providing services.\n\n“However, it could also include casual sellers who sold personal stuff like clothing, furniture and other household items that they paid more than they sold it for,” the IRS said.\n\nWhat is the deadline to file an extension?\n\nThe IRS says the deadline to file for an extension is April 15. That gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file without penalties.\n\nBut, taxpayers must still pay any taxes owed by the April 15 deadline as the extension only applies to filing a tax return.\n\nFor people affected by natural disasters, the extension is automatically given.\n\nHow can I request an extension for a tax return?\n\nExtension requests can be done through the IRS at no charge. The IRS will ask for basic information like your name, address, Social Security number, estimated tax liability, and payment if you owe anything.\n\nRegardless of income, individual tax filers can use IRS Free File to request an extension electronically. If you prefer to mail a paper version of the extension, called form 4868, make sure it's postmarked no later than April 15.\n\nWhat happens if I miss the tax deadline?\n\nFor people who forget or miss the deadline altogether, the standard penalty is 5% of the tax due for every month the return is late, up to 25% of the unpaid balance.\n\nA smaller penalty of 0.5% is added if you file a return but fail to pay any taxes you owe, or if you get an extension on your return but fail to pay your owed taxes.\n\nHow many people file their taxes every year?\n\nMore than 163 million tax returns were received in 2024, a 0.9% increase compared to 2023, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nContributing: James Powel, Emily DeLetter\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Well, early filers, we now know the official date.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service gave the kickoff date for the 2025 tax season Friday, indicating that the agency will begin accepting and processing individual income tax returns on Jan. 27.\n\nIf you’re an early filer, it’s good news to learn that start of the tax season won't be delayed and pushed into a February start for some reason. After all, the earlier the IRS can accept your e-filed tax return, the earlier you might get your hands on tax refund cash.\n\nA new Direct File system — which offers eligible taxpayers a way through the IRS to prepare and file their tax return online, for free — will be available Jan. 27, too, for many individual taxpayers in 25 states, not including Michigan.\n\nThe deadline for most filers is April 15.\n\nIRS Commissioner Danny Werfel on Friday highlighted the Internal Revenue Service's efforts to offer more tools and filing options this year to taxpayers.\n\n“These taxpayer-focused improvements we’ve done so far are important, but they are just the beginning of what the IRS needs to do. More can be done with continued investment in the nation’s tax system,\" Werfel stated.\n\nWerfel reiterated that the IRS needs continued adequate funding to support its ongoing efforts to modernize the agency.\n\nThe IRS expects more than 140 million individual tax returns for 2024 to be filed before the April 15 deadline. More than half of all returns are expected to be filed with the help of a tax professional, according to the IRS.\n\nThis tax season, the IRS said, taxpayers will see \"more access to tax account information from text and voice virtual assistants, expanded features on the IRS Individual Online Account, more access to dozens of tax forms through cell phones and tablets and expanded alerts for scams and schemes that threaten taxpayers.\"\n\nWerfel said in a news media briefing Friday that improvements in the IRS individual online account system will now allow taxpayers to view key details of their tax return online. With an IRS online account, tax filers can also request an Identity Protection PIN and get account transcripts to include wage and income records.\n\nHere are more details to get the tax juices flowing:\n\nHow many people file tax returns that first week?\n\nGetting it all together to file a tax return by late January or early February isn't for everyone, but the super early filers are eager to get what could be thousands of dollars in tax refund cash.\n\nTens of millions of tax returns are typically filed in the first week of a tax season. Last year, more than 15.3 million federal income tax returns were received by the IRS by Feb. 2. The IRS began processing and accepting 2023 federal income tax returns on Jan. 29, 2024.\n\nThe IRS processes more than 13.9 million individual income tax returns during that first week of the season last year.\n\nHow big is the average tax refund?\n\nA tax refund check is often biggest check that many households see all year.\n\nThe average federal income tax refund in 2024 was $3,138 based on IRS data through Dec. 27, down 0.9% from the same period in 2023.\n\nThe IRS issued more than 104.8 million income tax refunds in 2024, down 0.8% from 2023.\n\nThe IRS issued a total of $329.07 billion in income tax refunds through Dec. 27, down 1.7% from the same period in 2023.\n\nThe IRS processed 163.5 million individual income tax returns in 2024, but that number also includes some returns received in prior years but processed in 2024.\n\nHow soon can I expect to see my tax refund?\n\nIf you're an early filer, though, it's important to remember that some tax refunds won't be issued as quickly as some tax filers would like.\n\nBy law, the IRS cannot issue refunds before mid-February for returns that properly claim the advanced child tax credit or the earned income tax credit. The IRS must delay the entire refund, not just the amount associated with the credits. The delay is designed to give the IRS more time to detect and prevent errors and fraud.\n\nThe IRS issues most refunds in less than 21 days, especially when the return is filed electronically, and the refund is to be made via direct deposit into a bank account. Some refunds arrive even earlier than that. But the IRS cautions taxpayers not to rely on receiving a refund by a set date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills.\n\nSome returns require additional review and take longer.\n\nThe \"Where's My Refund?\" tool at IRS.gov has been updated, according to the IRS. It can help you track your refund status 24 hours after an e-filed return for the current tax year has been filed. The tool has information to track a paper return, as well, but you'd have to wait four weeks after the paper return was filed to see an online update.\n\nThe \"Where's My Refund?\" tool will update information overnight. Taxpayers are advised that there is no need to check the tool more than once a day.\n\nE-file or paper return?\n\nThe IRS is continuing to encourage taxpayers who still file paper returns to make the switch to e-filing that return and opting for direct deposit of their tax refund cash.\n\n\"Paper refund checks are 16 times more likely to have an issue, like the check being lost, misdirected, stolen or uncashed,\" according to the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service.\n\nThe IRS notes that people who don't have bank accounts might consider getting direct deposit via prepaid debit cards or mobile apps. But it's essential that the taxpayer has the correct routing and account numbers associated with those cards or apps that can be entered on your tax return.\n\nCheck with the mobile app provider or financial institution to confirm which numbers to use.\n\nNo more I Bonds with tax refunds\n\nIt's a big change that will only impact a small group of savers. But you're not going to be able to allocate any of your tax refund directly toward buying inflation-indexed U.S. savings bonds when you file that 2024 federal income tax return.\n\nIn the past, you could buy up to $5,000 in paper I Bonds with your tax refund when you filed Form 8888 \"Allocation of Refund\" with your tax return.\n\nWhat paperwork do you need to do your taxes?\n\nA \"Get Ready\" page at IRS.gov highlights important steps taxpayers can take now before filing a return, as well as a variety of resources available.\n\nYou shouldn't try to file a tax return until you have all your paperwork, including W-2 forms from employers, 1099s from banks and third-party payment platforms, and other statements.\n\nScams remain a real threat\n\nCon artists continue to craft ways to steal your important personal information, which can be used to file fake tax returns and other scams.\n\nA new banner on the IRS Online Account homepage will alert taxpayers of potential scams and schemes, along with a link to their \"Digital Notices and Letters\" page to view correspondence sent to them from the IRS.\n\nHow can you file a return for free?\n\nVarious free programs exist, many with some limitations, for Michigan residents.\n\nThe IRS Free File program at IRS.gov offers free tax software in 2025 to those with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less. Eligible taxpayers can access \"Free File\" beginning today.\n\nGo to IRS.gov/freefile for information.\n\nFor 2025, the participants in IRS Free File are: 1040Now, Drake (1040.com), ezTaxReturn.com, FileYourTaxes.com, On-Line Taxes, TaxAct, TaxHawk (FreeTaxUSA), and TaxSlayer.\n\nOne partner — ezTaxReturn.com — will offer a product in Spanish.\n\nFree File providers will allow taxpayers to prepare and file returns now and hold those return until they can be electronically filed on that date. Many other software companies offer a similar option.\n\nTaxpayers at any income level can use the Free File fillable forms starting Jan. 27. These electronic versions of IRS paper forms can work for someone who is able to prepare their own taxes using IRS instructions and publications.\n\nFree Fillable forms do not provide the step-by-step work that the software does, but there is no income limit and no need to print anything out.\n\nThe Free Fillable forms are all online and the system e-files your return directly with the IRS at no cost.\n\nMany low-income to moderate-income people also qualify for free tax preparation assistance at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites, including the Accounting Aid Society in Detroit, and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs. In 2025, people who generally make $67,000 or less qualify for these services.\n\nA Department of Defense program called MilTax generally offers free return preparation and e-filing for federal income tax returns and up to three state income tax returns for all military members, and some veterans, with no income limit.\n\nSome 30 million tax filers in half the country are expected to qualify for Direct File this year. The states that are participating in Direct File are Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nMichigan isn't on the list for Direct File now but could be in future years if the program is expanded.\n\nWerfel said Friday that lessons learned during last year's pilot involving Direct File in the 12 states enabled the IRS to expand to 25 states beginning Jan. 27. He did not offer an estimate for how soon other states might sign up to participate in Direct File.\n\nWerfel noted that Direct File is designed to allow a tax filer to complete both their federal and state returns. The IRS, he said, does a seamless handoff to individual states to the state's version of Direct File. \"You complete your state taxes and you're done,\" he said.\n\n\"It's an option. No taxpayer has to use Direct File,\" Werfel said.\n\nTo participate, the individual state must have its system set up for a smooth transition. Many other states, Werfel said, have expressed interest. \"It's just a question of are they ready for that handoff? Do they have their version of Direct File ready?\"\n\nThe biggest constraint to how quickly Direct File will expand to other states, if the program goes forward, will depend on the state's readiness, Werfel said.\n\nThe Direct File system, according to the IRS, has a data import tool that will allow taxpayers to opt-in to automatically import some data from their IRS account this year, such as name and address, the taxpayer’s identity protection PIN and some information from the taxpayer’s W-2.\n\nThis year, a new chat bot is available to guide them through figuring out whether they're eligible for Direct File. A tax filer also can opt into additional authentication and verification, which will allow customer service representatives to provide more information.\n\nThe expanded Direct File program will cover more tax situations this year, such as taxpayers claiming the child and dependent care credit, the premium tax credit, the credit for elderly and disabled people and retirement savings contribution credits.\n\nLike last year, Direct File will also cover taxpayers claiming the earned income tax credit, child tax credit, and the credit for other dependents.\n\nDirect File has its limits. Direct File and the state tax authority work together to help a taxpayer file both their federal and state return. However, if someone has income from more than one state, and needs to file more than one state return, the person would not be able to use Direct File in 2025.\n\nIn addition, you cannot use the new Direct File system in 2025, if you have taxable income from the gig economy, rental income or business income. You also cannot use Direct File if you itemize deductions.\n\nWhat do you need to know about filing a Michigan return?\n\nMichigan will begin processing state income tax returns immediately, right from the beginning of tax season, according to Sarah Rusnell, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Treasury.\n\nMichigan income tax returns are due April 15, the same as the federal due date.\n\nThe Michigan income tax rate returned to 4.25% for individuals on Jan. 1, 2024. That's up from a temporary reduced rate of 4.05% that only applied to 2023.\n\nNo new laws for tax year 2024 triggered big changes in tax rules on the Michigan tax forms. But eligible taxpayers will want to review some tax breaks, including the Michigan Earned Income Tax Credit for Working Families, Michigan Homestead Property Tax Credit, and the Retirement and Pension Benefits Subtraction.\n\nMore information is at michigan.gov/IIT.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

When does the IRS start accepting tax returns?", "text": "Jan. 13, 2025, 11:09 a.m. ET\n\nIt's time to get your finances in order because Tax Day will be here before you know it.\n\nTax Day, the annual day when individual income tax returns are due to the federal government, is April 15.\n\nBut when is the earliest day you can file a return? How can you track your tax refund? Here's what to know.\n\nWhen does the IRS start accepting tax returns in 2025?\n\nMonday, Jan. 27, is the official start of the 2025 tax season, according to the IRS.\n\nWhen is the tax deadline in 2025?\n\nTax Day is always April 15 unless the day falls on a weekend or holiday. Tax Day this year will be Tuesday, April 15.\n\nWhen does tax season start? How early can I file my 2025 taxes?\n\nTax season typically starts around the end of January. This year, tax season begins Monday, Jan. 27.\n\nBut that does not mean you can’t get started on your tax filing now. The Internal Revenue Service opens up its tax software before the start of tax season to allow people to begin preparing their returns. The IRS has also published a list of tips to help make the tax filing process easier.\n\nWhat is the deadline to file an extension?\n\nThe IRS says the deadline to file for an extension is April 15. That gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file without penalties.\n\nHow can I request an extension for a tax return?\n\nIf a taxpayer cannot file by the April 15 deadline, they can request an extension through form 4868. However, this extension to file is not an extension to pay taxes. Any owed taxes should be paid before the due date to avoid potential penalties and interest on the amount owed.\n\nVictims in disaster areas designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency may also have an automatic extension. Taxpayers in those affected areas do not need to file for an extension or call the IRS to qualify for the extended time.\n\nTo check if your area is included, visit the IRS webpage on tax relief in disaster situations.\n\nWhen are state taxes due?\n\nMost states have the same deadline as the federal government: April 15. It's a good idea to check your state's tax office website, which should have the most up-to-date information and state tax filing deadlines.\n\nOhio, Indiana, and Kentucky's state tax filing deadlines are April 15.\n\nWhat happens if I don't file taxes?\n\nIf you don't file your taxes by April 15 ‒ or by the extended deadline, Oct. 15, if you qualify for an extension – you will receive a notice from the IRS that you owe a Failure to File Penalty. The penalty is a percentage of the taxes you didn't pay on time.\n\nThe standard penalty is 5% of the tax due for every month the return is late, up to 25% of the unpaid balance.\n\nA smaller penalty of 0.5% is added if you file a return but fail to pay any taxes you owe, or if you get an extension on your return but fail to pay your owed taxes.\n\nIf you're able to show reasonable cause why you weren't able to meet your tax obligations, the IRS may be able to remove or reduce some penalties.\n\nWhen can I expect my refund?\n\nIf you filed your taxes online, you can expect to receive a refund in one month or less, in most cases. The IRS says it issues most refunds within 21 calendar days. Paper returns, however, can take four weeks or more. Allow time for the refund check to reach your bank account or mailbox.\n\nHow to check my tax refund\n\nYou can check the status of your federal tax refund online at irs.gov/refunds.\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2026/01/19/how-to-get-free-tax-software-to-do-your-2025-federal-return/88145900007/", "title": "There's still a way at the IRS to do your 2025 return online for free", "text": "Updated Jan. 19, 2026, 1:13 p.m. ET\n\nFree File is not Direct File, which the IRS has discontinued for the 2026 tax season.\n\nThis tax season, according to the IRS, eight private-sector partners are offering guided tax software products through IRS Free File.\n\nThe IRS Free File program is up and running for the 2026 tax season — and taxpayers can use the system even before the Internal Revenue Service officially accepts tax returns beginning Jan. 26.\n\nIndividuals who qualify do not have to pay a dime for the tax software offered through this program, if they go through IRS.gov/freefile and pick one of eight tax software companies that have agreed to provide free software to someone in their situation.\n\nFree File is not Direct File, which the IRS has discontinued for the 2026 tax season. Direct File, which was a pilot program, was never available nationwide. It started being offered in 12 states in 2024 and then was expanded to 25 states last year, not including Michigan. The U.S. Treasury Department announced the end of Direct File in November 2025.\n\nThe Direct File program had a special feature that made doing taxes easier because returns could be pre-populated with tax information that the IRS already had on file, including information from W-2 forms. Free File doesn't do that.\n\nDirect File allowed taxpayers who qualified to file relatively simple returns online directly with the IRS, including wage income from jobs reported on a W-2, Social Security income, pension and annuity income, and more. The system guided taxpayers through a series of questions to prepare their federal tax return step-by-step.\n\nGiven that the end of Direct File triggered big news, some taxpayers might wrongly believe that no way exists to prepare your 2025 federal income tax return online for free at IRS.gov.\n\nYet, do-it-yourself tax filers who are eager to save money shouldn't overlook the Free File program, which began in 2003 and remains in place for taxpayers who had an adjusted gross income of $89,000 or less in 2025.\n\nWhile the filing season begins Monday Jan. 26, IRS Free File software is allowing taxpayers to prepare and submit returns now and hold them for electronic filing once the season officially begins.\n\nThe IRS Free File program began accepting individual tax returns Jan. 9 for qualified taxpayers. Taxpayers who prepare their own taxes can use IRS Free File Fillable Forms starting Jan. 26, regardless of income.\n\nNot everyone can use Free File, but far more people are eligible for the program than those who actually take advantage of it. The service has been promoted as a way that can help 70% of American taxpayers prepare and e-file their federal tax returns.\n\nYet, only 3.1 million individual returns — or around 1.93% — used Free File in fiscal year 2024 out of 161 million individual income tax returns that were filed, according to IRS data. In Michigan, according to the IRS, Free File was used to prepare and submit 100,209 individual income tax returns that year.\n\nFor a fun comparison, some 10.8 million individual returns were filed by paper in fiscal year 2024, and 141,000 returns were filed using Direct File, which was available then in 12 states, according to IRS data.\n\nFree File is one of those underused freebies that can benefit do-it-yourself tax filers.\n\nThis tax season, according to the IRS, eight private-sector partners are offering guided tax software products through IRS Free File. A long list of details is provided at IRS.gov/freefile.\n\nYou only get access to the Free File site by going directly through the IRS website.\n\nThe IRS notes that the term \"free\" means that eligible taxpayers can prepare and e-file their federal tax returns at no cost using tax preparation software provided by the members of what's called the Free File Alliance.\n\nIf you're looking for free software here, you need to understand that many people will not be eligible to work with any of the eight programs being offered now. In some cases, you might be eligible to work with three or so providers.\n\nEach partner providing tax software sets its own requirements for who can use free software on that platform. Maybe the provider has an age or income limit.\n\nThe IRS site gives you a fairly easy set of questions to answer that will help direct you to the software companies that will offer free services to you, based on your income, age, the state you live in and other factors.\n\nOr you can browse a list of requirements listed by each provider on the IRS site.\n\nOnline Taxes at OLT.com, for example, will provide services for those who have an AGI maximum limit of $51,000 unless you're active military and have an AGI of $89,000 or less.\n\nTaxSlayer has an age limit of 67 or younger with an AGI between $19,000 and $89,000. If you're active duty military with an AGI of $89,000 or less, then no age requirement applies. TaxSlayer will handle returns for those who are eligible for the earned income tax credit and has no age limit for those tax filers who use the Free File system.\n\nAgain, you want to browse the offers directly at IRS.gov so that you're not somehow directed to a program that appears to be free online but really isn't.\n\nAdmittedly, the Free File program has its limitations once you see the restrictions put in place by individual partners. TaxAct has an age limit of 20 through 60 unless active military when you use the Free File program.\n\nSome partners offer free state tax return preparation and filing; some, like ezTaxReturn, do not.\n\nThe list of participants has grown increasingly smaller over the years. In 2014, for example, the IRS listed 14 tax software companies that were participating in Free File. H&R Block and Intuit dropped out of the Free File Alliance several years ago.\n\nSome of the fallout came after much controversy and criticism, including some allegations of deceptive practices by some participants to direct consumers to other programs that charged a fee and weren't free.\n\nFor the 2026 tax season, the IRS lists the following partners in Free File: 1040Now; Drake (1040.com); ezTaxReturn.com (offers English and Spanish); FileYourTaxes.com; On-Line Taxes; TaxAct; TaxHawk (FreeTaxUSA); and TaxSlayer. The program had the same eight partners in 2025.\n\nYou can only file your current year tax return using IRS Free File; you cannot process a prior year return using the system.\n\nFiling earlier in the season, of course, can enable you to get a tax refund more quickly.\n\nThe 2026 tax season, though, has some brand new deductions — such as a tax break on tips and another tax break on overtime pay — that could make preparing taxes far more complicated for those who qualify for those tax breaks.\n\nIn some cases, it could pay to wait to file until we see more IRS guidance further into the tax season, especially regarding tip income and overtime pay, said Tom O’Saben, enrolled agent and director of tax content and government relations for the National Association of Tax Professionals.\n\nAfter all, do-it-yourselfers looking for a deal still want to make sure they've done things right.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

When will the IRS accept returns in 2026?", "text": "Jan. 1, 2026 Updated Jan. 2, 2026, 7:51 a.m. ET\n\nThe IRS will no longer be issuing tax refunds by paper check to most individual taxpayers who file 2025 tax returns.\n\nIn 2025, the IRS kicked off the tax season on Monday Jan. 27 when the agency began accepting and processing federal income tax returns. Many wonder when the IRS will begin accepting returns in 2026.\n\nIn 2025, the average federal income tax refund hit $3,052 based on the latest IRS data. Refunds in 2026 likely will be larger for those who qualify for new deductions.\n\nFor some people, tax refunds could turn out to be much fatter in 2026 than they'd expect after dramatic changes in key tax rules hit 2025 federal income tax returns.\n\nBut the upcoming tax season likely will have its share of hiccups, including potential delays and extra confusion as many households try to figure out whether they qualify for lucrative new deductions for tip income, overtime pay, car loan interest and the new tax break for those 65 and older.\n\nThe new tax breaks come with restrictions that many tax filers likely won't expect and definitely won't understand without taking time to review them.\n\nAnd you'll need to file a new Schedule 1-A — which was only available online in draft form in late December — to claim key tax breaks, including those for overtime, tips, seniors and car loans. You cannot file a draft form with the IRS.\n\nAnother big change: The IRS will no longer be issuing tax refunds by paper check to most individual taxpayers. If you've opted to receive a paper check for years, you'll need to figure out a way to get your federal income tax refund via direct deposit.\n\nIf someone doesn't have a bank account, they can use prepaid debit cards or digital wallets. The IRS said limited exceptions will be available.\n\n\"Only 7% of individual refund recipients received their refunds by check through the mail,\" the IRS stated.\n\nWhen can I file my 2025 federal income tax return?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service had not yet issued its official start date for the 2026 tax season as of Dec. 31. That's not too unusual because that start date is usually announced in January.\n\n\"We expect to have a 'Go Live' date any time now,\" said Mark Steber, chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Services.\n\nIn 2025, the IRS kicked off the tax season on Monday, Jan. 27, when the agency began accepting and processing federal income tax returns.\n\nThis year, tax experts told me that they would not be shocked if we saw a slight delay to the tax season kickoff — meaning that early filers could have to wait a bit longer for tax refunds, too.\n\nFeb. 2 lands on a Monday in 2026, and some speculate that tax season could kick off that week, according to George Smith, a CPA with Andrews Hooper Pavlik in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.\n\nThe 2026 tax season will have its quirks, given that the IRS has faced significant job cuts and turnover in leadership in 2025. Currently, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent serves as acting IRS commissioner, in addition to his top job at Treasury.\n\nFrank Bisignano — the commissioner of the Social Security Administration — was named to a newly created position of CEO of the IRS in October. Bisignano will report directly to Bessent, managing the organization and overseeing all day-to-day IRS operations. Bisignano will continue his role as commissioner of the Social Security Administration.\n\n\"These are not like regular years,\" Jackson Hewitt's Steber said.\n\nWhile many people drag their feet and file closer to the typical April 15 deadline, millions of people eagerly file tax returns as early as they can to get their hands on tax refund cash.\n\nDuring the initial days of the filing season in 2025, the IRS had received more than 13.1 million tax returns as of Jan. 31, 2025. More than 3.2 million refunds were processed in those few short days with an average refund of $1,928 at that time.\n\nAs the tax season progressed, we saw a bigger jump in the size of average refunds. In 2025, the average federal income tax refund hit $3,052 as of the week ending Oct. 17, the latest data published by the IRS. That was up 1.6% from a year earlier.\n\nThrough Oct. 17, the IRS received more than 163.5 million individual income tax returns. It issued about 102.1 million income tax refunds.\n\nThe federal government issued more than $311.6 billion in income tax refunds through Oct. 17, up 0.6%.\n\nDo you have to file taxes in 2026? Here's why you might want to\n\nWhen can I expect my tax refund?\n\nNo one, obviously, can get a tax refund until after the IRS receives and processes the tax return. You can prepare your return when you have your paperwork in order — and when the IRS has new forms available.\n\nBut you cannot submit your return to the IRS until the official start date or afterward.\n\nTax returns that claim the earned income tax credit, which can have substantially larger refunds, always face delays by law that require that those refunds be issued after mid-February.\n\nThe IRS issues most refunds in less than 21 days, especially when the return is filed electronically, and the refund is to be made via direct deposit into a bank account. Some refunds arrive even earlier than that.\n\nKey changes ahead for your taxes\n\nSeveral significant changes in tax rules hit 2025 federal income tax returns for the first time. Many of the changes — such as tax breaks on tips and overtime — generated big headlines, but the real trick for taxpayers will involve digging into the tiny details.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4. Many new tax breaks are retroactive to Jan. 1, 2025, and will apply to the 2025 federal income tax returns that you file in early 2026.\n\nHere's what to keep in mind as we prepare for the upcoming 2026 tax season:\n\nLook for more paperwork: You do not want to overlook the new, two-page, federal income tax form called Schedule 1-A, which must be completed when filing your 2025 federal income tax return to claim a new deduction for overtime pay, as well as new deductions for tip income, car loan interest and the new tax break for those 65 and older.\n\nA draft form was online as of Dec. 31, but you'd need an actual form to file a return and claim key deductions for a bigger refund.\n\nA point to remember: Taxpayers can claim key tax breaks for tips, overtime, car loans and seniors even if they take the standard deduction and do not itemize deductions.\n\nMany but not all will see bigger refunds: We're hearing much buzz from the Trump administration indicating that refunds could be significantly bigger in 2026. And they will be for many but not all tax filers.\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, stated on Fox Business on Dec. 18 that \"people are going to get massive refund checks.\"\n\nHassett, who many expect will be nominated in 2026 by Trump to serve as chair of the Federal Reserve, said the country will see \"the biggest refund cycle ever in the history of America.\"\n\nGarrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, said refunds are likely to be higher for some groups who qualify for new tax breaks, particularly since many taxpayers have not had any adjustments to tax withholding on their 2025 paychecks that would take the new deductions into account.\n\nThe IRS did not adjust withholding tables after the law passed, the Tax Foundation noted, so workers generally continued to withhold more taxes from their paychecks than the new law required.\n\n\"As a result, instead of gradually receiving the benefit of the tax cuts through higher take-home pay during the year, most taxpayers will receive it all at once when they file their returns,\" the Tax Foundation stated in an update Dec. 17.\n\nTo break down the numbers, Watson said first consider the baseline refunds before any impact of the new tax cuts.\n\nThe Tax Foundation estimates that baseline refunds would likely remain stable, averaging around $330 billion overall and around $3,100 on average for tax filers, as has been the case from 2023 through last year.\n\nIn each of the past two tax years, the Tax Foundation said, more than 100 million taxpayers have received refunds averaging around $3,000.\n\n\"The new tax cuts from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will add to this refund number,\" Watson said.\n\nThe size of federal income tax refunds in 2026 is going to vary dramatically, depending on the taxpayer's situation.\n\nThe Tax Foundation noted that private-sector economic analysis suggests that tax breaks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could drive average refunds up by somewhere between $300 to $1,000 — or add up to $100 billion to total refunds paid out during the 2026 filing season.\n\nWatson noted that would translate to an average refund that could be upwards of $4,000 under the right conditions.\n\n\"The biggest items driving this increase are targeted to certain types of income or certain taxpayers, like seniors,\" Watson said.\n\nAs a result, he said, the projected average obscures a large variation between taxpayers who may benefit greatly from some new tax breaks and other taxpayers who may see only small changes to refunds.\n\nSome key benefits that could boost refunds include:\n\nA new $6,000 additional deduction for many who are 65 and older. That tax break starts phasing out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 if single and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nA new auto loan interest deduction that can apply to up to $10,000 in interest paid in a year. That deduction phases out by $200 for every $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for joint filers. A single person with $149,001 in income or more would not receive any deduction, said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting in Riverwoods, Illinois. Very specific rules apply. Consumers would have had to have taken out a car loan in 2025 to buy new cars with final assembly in the United States to claim the deduction on their 2025 federal income tax returns, if they qualify.\n\nA new, but fairly complex deduction for up to $25,000 in tip income that starts phasing out when taxpayers earn more than $150,000 if single or $300,000 if married filing a joint return.\n\nA new deduction for up to $12,500 in overtime income for singles or $25,000 for joint filers. That deduction starts phasing out when taxpayers earn more than $150,000 if single or $300,000 if married filing a joint return.\n\nA maximum child tax credit increase of $200\n\nThe standard deduction will increase by $750 for single filers and $1,500 for joint filers.\n\nWhat to do about direct deposit\n\nFor 2025 returns, taxpayers will be asked to provide the IRS with their direct deposit information or demonstrate that they qualify for an exception and should still receive a check.\n\nSomeone who typically received a paper tax refund check would want to work ahead to get direct deposit information before trying to complete their tax return — or even open an account in advance so that you'd be ready when you do file.\n\nTaxpayers without a bank account can learn how to open one at an FDIC insured bank or through the National Credit Union Locator Tool. Veterans, see the Veterans Benefits Banking Program for financial services options at participating banks.\n\nYou can see FDIC.gov/getbanked for options for opening an account online with a low opening deposit. Or see mapping.ncua.gov to find a credit union.\n\nIf you don't do anything, it's possible you're going to wait a long time for that federal income tax refund.\n\nDuring the e-filing process, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate Service, individuals will receive an alert or message if their banking information is missing from the 2025 tax return.\n\n\"These tax returns will still be accepted and processed without the direct deposit information, but taxpayers should understand that refunds will be delayed,\" the blog states.\n\nAfter filing, the blog explains, the IRS will send taxpayers a letter requesting banking information within 30 days if their return fails to include the information or if the direct deposit has been rejected by their bank.\n\nThe letter will also provide information on exceptions and provide a dedicated phone line taxpayers may call to request an exception and request that paper check be issued.\n\nAfter six weeks, the IRS will resort to issuing a paper check to taxpayers to prevent interest from accruing on the refund amount, according to the blog by the National Taxpayer Advocate Service, which was updated Dec. 4.\n\nIt's essential that you provide accurate information for your account number and the correct routing number for the financial institution.\n\nTax season — whether it starts in late January or early February — is bound to be unlike any other we've seen in recent years. It will not hurt to start brushing up on the rules and gathering the paperwork as early as you can.\n\nAnd really, get ready to pack your patience.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent expressed excitement over this upcoming tax season, stating.\n\n“President Trump is committed to the taxpayers of this country and improving upon the successful tax filing season in 2025,” said Bessent. “Prior to the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which delivered working families tax cuts, Treasury and IRS were diligently preparing to update forms and processes for the benefit of hardworking Americans, and I am confident in our ability to deliver results and drive growth for businesses and consumers alike.”\n\n“The Internal Revenue Service is ready to help taxpayers meet their tax filing and payment obligations during the 2026 filing season,” said IRS Chief Executive Officer Frank Bisignano. “As always, the IRS workforce remains vigilant and dedicated to its mission to serve the American taxpaying public. At the same time, IRS information systems have been updated to incorporate the new tax laws and are ready to efficiently and effectively process taxpayer returns during the filing season.”\n\nTaxpayers are encouraged to file early to take advantage of these benefits and ensure a smooth refund process.\n\nWhen will the IRS begin accepting tax returns in 2026?\n\nThe IRS announced that the first day of the 2026 tax season is Jan. 26. People will be able to file their 2025 returns starting then.\n\nTax cut changes for 2026 season: What to know\n\nAccording to a news release from Turbotax, most of the changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill took effect on Jan. 1, but some are retroactive and could impact the 2025 tax returns that you file in 2026.\n\nMany of the changes have certain requirements, such as adjusted gross income limits, and some are temporary, only lasting for a few years.\n\nChanges that might affect the most common 2025 tax returns include:\n\nNo tax on tips - deduction of up to $25,000 per taxpayer with phaseout for Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) over $150,000 (over $300,000 for Married Filing Jointly filers)\n\n- deduction of up to $25,000 per taxpayer with phaseout for Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) over $150,000 (over $300,000 for Married Filing Jointly filers) No tax on overtime - deduction of up to $12,500 per taxpayer with phaseout for MAGI over $150,000 (over $300,000 for Married Filing Jointly filers)\n\n- deduction of up to $12,500 per taxpayer with phaseout for MAGI over $150,000 (over $300,000 for Married Filing Jointly filers) Additional senior deduction (2025 through 2028) - additional $6,000 deduction for taxpayers 65 and older with phaseout for MAGI over $75,000 (over $150,000 for Married Filing Jointly filers)\n\n- additional $6,000 deduction for taxpayers 65 and older with phaseout for MAGI over $75,000 (over $150,000 for Married Filing Jointly filers) Partially refundable adoption credit - up to $5,000 (adjusted for inflation) refundable\n\n- up to $5,000 (adjusted for inflation) refundable I ncreased state and local tax (SALT) itemized deduction - increased to $40,000 for 2025 and adjusted annually thereafter for 2026 through 2029\n\n- increased to $40,000 for 2025 and adjusted annually thereafter for 2026 through 2029 Deduction for interest payments on certain vehicles - up to $10,000 deduction with phaseout for MAGI over $100,000 (over $200,000 for Married Filing Jointly filers)\n\n- up to $10,000 deduction with phaseout for MAGI over $100,000 (over $200,000 for Married Filing Jointly filers) Increase in the standard deduction - increases the 2025 Standard Deduction to $15,750 for Single, $23,625 for Head of Household, and $31,500 for Married Filing Jointly filers. These amounts will increase with inflation each year.\n\nAdditionally, the standard deduction amounts have been adjusted for inflation, providing taxpayers with a larger buffer against taxable income.\n\nThe Child Tax Credit has also increased to $2,200 per qualifying child, offering additional relief to families.\n\nThe cap on the State and Local Taxes (SALT) deduction has also been raised to $40,000, allowing taxpayers to deduct more of their local tax payments.\n\nWhere's my refund?\n\nTaxpayers can track the status of their refunds using the \"Where’s My Refund?\" tool on the IRS website.\n\nThe tool provides updates on refund status as soon as 24 hours after e-filing a current-year return and about four weeks after mailing a paper return. By entering their Social Security number, filing status, and exact refund amount, taxpayers can check the progress of their refund.\n\nAccording to the IRS, most refunds are issued within 21 days for returns filed electronically with direct deposit, provided there are no issues.\n\nHowever, refunds for taxpayers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) will not be issued before mid-February.\n\nIs there a way to file my taxes for free?\n\nThe IRS Free File program offers free online tax preparation and filing options and is already available to qualified taxpayers. You can find more information on how to file for free at irs.gov.\n\nThose who prefer to prepare their own taxes can access the IRS Free File Fillable Forms beginning Jan. 26, regardless of income level.\n\nWays to file for free: IRS shuts down Direct File. Here's how NC tax payers can file for free\n\nTrump's savings accounts for children\n\nThe \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" also introduces Trump Savings Accounts for children, providing an opportunity for families to save for their children's future, according to a news release from Turbotax.\n\nThese accounts are expected to function as a new type of IRA for children, and with Form 4547, families can have the IRS establish a Trump account for eligible children.\n\nThe U.S. government will contribute $1,000 to each account for children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, providing a solid foundation for future financial security.\n\nIRS begins to phase out paper checks\n\nThe IRS strongly encourages taxpayers to establish a bank account to receive their tax refunds via direct deposit.\n\nThe IRS is phasing out paper tax refund checks following the executive order, Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Accounts, read a release from the agency.\n\nDirect deposit is a faster, more secure method of receiving refunds, ensuring taxpayers get their money promptly and safely, according to the agency.\n\nTravis Rose covers Anderson County for the Independent Mail.

Life expectancy, which is actually a measure of death rates, dropped in every age category over age 1.\n\nThough the rate of decline in life expectancy wasn't as dramatic as in 2020, Woolf said, the fall-off in 2021 was actually worse because it came on top of that year's 17% decline.\n\nThe latest decline came as other wealthy countries saw a rebound after the first year of the pandemic, Woolf said. He blames a variety of factors, including low COVID-19 vaccination rates and the general poor health of Americans.\n\n\"The fact that the United States in 2020 and 2021 did so much worse than other countries is a warning sign that this health disadvantage that America has had for many years is really getting pretty bad,\" he said.\n\nHow many people died last year from ODs?: Nearly 107,000 drug overdoses, COVID deaths, push US life expectancy to lowest in 25 years\n\nWhat's killing Americans?\n\nCauses of death remained largely the same between 2020 and 2021, led by heart disease, cancer and COVID-19, all three of which occurred more often last year.\n\nEight of the top 10 causes of death saw statistically significant increases in 2021 over 2020, including unintentional injury and stroke. Only Alzheimer's disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases declined among the leading causes of death.\n\nDeath rates from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, which are often alcohol-related, also rose during the pandemic, the data showed. Woolf said people might have turned to alcohol to reduce economic, social and other stresses of the previous two years.\n\nDrug overdoses increased during the pandemic, but Woolf doesn't like the common term \"deaths of despair\" because many people start taking addictive painkillers on a doctor's orders after a surgery.\n\nDeath rate increasing at younger ages\n\nWoolf said he's particularly concerned about the drop in life expectancy for people in middle age, who should be at the prime of their working years.\n\nThis trend began a decade before the pandemic, but COVID-19 contributed, he said, particularly for people of color. A 40-year-old with multiple health problems was more likely to die of COVID-19 than someone of the same age in better health; in essence, poor health is making the American population look older than it is, he said.\n\nIt's not clear, he said, why deaths are increasing among younger adults and children, which had been declining before the pandemic.\n\nThe race gap reversed\n\nThe race gap reversed somewhat in 2021 as white people lost more ground than people of color, though they still live longer on average.\n\nDuring the first year of the pandemic, Hispanic and Black populations experienced much higher death rates than their white counterparts. They were more likely to be exposed to COVID-19 and to die when they got infected, Woolf said.\n\nBut in 2021, \"it's the white population that's done worse,\" he said. Death rates increased among people of color, but not as much as the 7% among white people.\n\nAmerican Indians and Native Alaskans continued the \"tragic losses\" seen in the first year of the pandemic, he said.\n\n\"The white population, which from a medical standpoint should not be experiencing higher death rates, did,\" Woolf said. Other data suggests that's because white people were more likely to avoid COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nWoolf said he sees a clear path toward improving America's health, by providing what other wealthy nations provide: quality education, affordable housing, access to healthy food, reduced income inequality and greater regulation of industries that pollute or provide potentially dangerous products such as cars or guns.\n\n\"We need to make a decision as to whether we're just going to accept those losses and accept that Americans are going to be less healthy than people (in other wealthy countries) and live much shorter lives or we need to do something about it,\" Woolf said. \"We don't lack solutions. We lack political will.\"\n\nWoolf said he doesn't think it will take 25 years for Americans to regain the ground lost over the past two. Once COVID-19 deaths fall, life expectancy numbers should bounce back, he said.\n\n\"But the fact that we took a hit like that and were pushed that far back in time while other countries did not is very concerning.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

The latest data released by the federal government show that the nation’s life expectancy declined for a second year in a row in 2021, to its lowest level in more than 25 years.\n\nFrom about 79 years in 2019, it fell to around 76, the sharpest two-year decline in nearly a century. Most wealthy countries saw their life-expectancy figures bounce back in the second year of the pandemic. Not so the US. The decline among American Indian and Alaskan Native people is particularly striking: their life expectancy fell from 71.8 years in 2019 to 65.2 in 2021, close to the national average during the Second World War.\n\n“To experience any stalling or reduction in life expectancy is tragic,” said Ryan Masters, one of the authors of the latest data; but to see reductions of three, four, five, or six years is “mind-boggling and heartbreaking”.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber.

Chokshi in The New York Times. But they also reflect other factors, including the opioid epidemic, gun violence and high rates of chronic disease. “America is at a fork in the road with respect to the health of the nation.”\n\nIt can seek to put Covid behind it and just continue on the same trajectory, as it did after the 1918 flu epidemic. Or it can embrace radical health reform, in the spirit of the “great sanitary awakening” that ended outbreaks of typhus, dysentery and cholera in the 19th century.\n\nWe’ve got to do something to stop the US being “the death trap of the wealthy world”, said Derek Thompson in The Atlantic.

America leads the world in some healthcare categories: there’s no better place to be if you contract prostate or breast cancer. This suggests that “the US is not utterly incompetent, but rather selectively competent”, and that if it can refocus its healthcare policies in the right way, it could “improve quickly”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/04/study-life-span-women/1963093/", "title": "Study finds declining life span for some women - USA Today", "text": "Mike Stobbe, Associated Press\n\nMarch 4, 2013, 5:11 p.m. ET\n\nMen%27s life expectancy has held steady or improved\n\nFalling rates of women%27s life expectancy found in South%2C West\n\nPattern found among disadvantaged women\n\nNEW YORK — A new study offers more compelling evidence that life expectancy for some U.S. women is actually falling, a disturbing trend that experts can't explain.\n\nThe latest research found that women age 75 and younger are dying at higher rates than previous years in nearly half of the nation's counties — many of them rural and in the South and West. Curiously, for men, life expectancy has held steady or improved in nearly all counties.\n\nThe study is the latest to spot this pattern, especially among disadvantaged white women. Some leading theories blame higher smoking rates, obesity and less education, but several experts said they simply don't know why.\n\nWomen have long outlived men, and the latest numbers show the average life span for a baby girl born today is 81, and for a baby boy, it's 76. But the gap has been narrowing and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown women's longevity is not growing at the same pace as men's.\n\nThe phenomenon of some women losing ground appears to have begun in the late 1980s, though studies have begun to spotlight it only in the last few years.\n\nTrying to figure out why is \"the hot topic right now, trying to understand what's going on,\" said Jennifer Karas Montez, a Harvard School of Public Health sociologist who has been focused on the life expectancy decline but had no role in the new study.\n\nResearchers also don't know exactly how many women are affected. Montez says a good estimate is roughly 12 percent.\n\nThe study, released Monday by the journal Health Affairs, found declining life expectancy for women in about 43% of the nation's counties.\n\nThe researchers, David Kindig and Erika Cheng of the University of Wisconsin, looked at federal death data and other information for nearly all 3,141 U.S. counties over 10 years. They calculated mortality rates for women age 75 and younger, sometimes called \"premature death rates,\" because many of those deaths are considered preventable.\n\nMany counties have such small populations that even slight changes in the number of deaths produce dramatic swings in the death rate from year to year. To try to stabilize the numbers, the researchers computed some five-year averages. They also used statistical tricks to account for factors like income and education.\n\nThey found that nationwide, the rate of women dying younger than would be expected fell from 324 to 318 per 100,000. But in 1,344 counties, the average premature death rate rose, from 317 to about 333 per 100,000. Deaths rates rose for men in only about 100 counties.\n\n\"We were surprised\" by how much worse women did in those counties, and by the geographic variations, Kindig said.\n\nThe study wasn't the first to reach those conclusions. Two years ago, a study led by the University of Washington's Dr. Christopher Murray also looked at county-level death rates. It too found that women were dying sooner, especially in the South.\n\nSome other studies that focused on national data have highlighted steep declines in life expectancy for white women who never earned a high school diploma. Meanwhile, life expectancy seems to be growing for more educated and affluent women. Some experts also have suggested smokers or obese women are dragging down life expectancy.\n\nThe Murray and Kindig studies both spotlight regional differences. Some of the highest smoking rates are in Southern states, and the proportion of women who failed to finish high school is also highest in the South.\n\n\"I think the most likely explanation for why mortality is getting worse is those factors are just stronger in those counties,\" Murray said, adding that abuse of Oxycontin and other drugs also may add to the problem.\n\nSome also think the statistics could reflect a migration of healthier women out of rural areas, leaving behind others who are too poor and unhealthy to relocate. That would change the rate, and make life expectancy in a county look worse, explained Bob Anderson of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics\n\n\"We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that more people are getting sicker in these geographic areas than previously,\" he said.\n\nBut that is open to debate. Migration didn't seem to affect male death rates. Murray disagrees with the theory, saying he has tracked a great deal of movement from urban areas to less-populated counties.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/11/22/native-american-students-left-behind-south-dakota-education-system/4269896002/", "title": "Native American students left behind by S.D. education system", "text": "Nick Lowrey\n\nSouth Dakota News Watch\n\nUpdated Nov. 22, 2019, 11:24 a.m. ET\n\nEditor's Note: This is the first of many in a special report in which South Dakota News Watch will examine the historical and current educational achievement gap between Native American and white students in South Dakota.\n\nThe South Dakota constitution demands that state government provide equal opportunity to education for all of its citizens, yet for decades Native Americans – who make up 9% of the population – have been left behind by a system that fails to meet their needs and has resulted in generations of Natives suffering the consequences of inadequate educational achievement.\n\nThe systematic failure to properly educate Native American students is seen as a major source of devastating later-in-life consequences that have plagued Native people and communities for decades: generational poverty, high unemployment, substance abuse, high incarceration rates and reduced life expectancy.\n\nThe latest results from both state and national standardized testing provides a window into just how dire the situation has become, as Native students continue to perform far worse than white students in South Dakota across almost all measures of academic achievement.\n\nDuring the 2018-19 school year, less than one in four Native American students in grades three to eight and grade 11 was rated as proficient in reading and writing on state standardized tests. Roughly one in seven Native American students was proficient in math, and just one in eight was proficient in science. A separate test, the 2019 National Assessment of Educational progress, found that South Dakota’s Native American fourth and eighth graders were between 25 and 30 points behind their white peers in math and reading.\n\nMore SD News Watch: Rural schools in S.D. face unique challenges that can affect learning\n\nOn-time graduation rates for Native American students also are lower than for every other racial group in the state at just 54%, compared with the rate of 85% for students of all backgrounds, according to the state report card. Some Native-dominated school systems in South Dakota suffer more than others, such as in McLaughlin, on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, where too few of the system’s roughly 440 students scored proficient in any subject for statistics to be reported.\n\nThe reasons for the poor performance are varied and complex, but many educators and experts interviewed as part of a two-month reporting effort by South Dakota News Watch to examine Native education in the state agree that the problems are rooted in circumstances far outside a student’s control.\n\n“I believe wholeheartedly that we are extremely intelligent, innovative people, but this system is not designed in a way that nurtures that,” said Sara Pierce, director of education equity at the West River nonprofit advocacy group NDN Collective.\n\nPierce, a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe who has worked in school systems in Omaha, Neb., and Rapid City, said the state’s schools have struggled to teach Native students in a way that is relevant and responsive to the culture in which they grew up. There also are relatively few Native American teachers in public school districts, which reduces emotional and educational connections and relationships, she said.\n\nThe number of different school systems serving Native American students can also be a problem, said Juliana White Bull-Taken Alive, director of the state Office of Indian Education.\n\nEach system has its own set of rules, philosophies and goals, she said. The lack of consistency hurts Native students, who tend to be more mobile than their peers and often hop between school systems one or more times before they graduate. Students in the Oglala Lakota County School District, for example, endure a built-in disruption to their educational path when they reach high school because there has not been a traditional high school in Pine Ridge for decades. Students must move to a virtual school online or transfer to a federal Bureau of Indian Affairs or private school on or near the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in order to stay on track to graduate.\n\n“Over the years, as an administrator working for the tribal departments and now for the state, I’ve seen that the biggest challenge in terms of our students, ultimately, is building consensus among our schools in the state,” White Bull-Taken Alive said.\n\nNative students also have the long, traumatic history of their peoples treatment at the hands of the federal government to contend with, both Pierce and White Bull-Taken Alive said.\n\nThey are hampered as well by the most recognizable consequence of that traumatic history – a deep cycle of poverty that persists in tribal communities to this day. In South Dakota, roughly 60% of Native American children were considered to live in poverty in 2018, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s annual Kids Count report. Only 8% of South Dakota white children were living in poverty that year, the report said.\n\nNumerous studies show that people of any race who come from a low-income background are more likely to struggle in school. Impoverished students tend to have smaller vocabularies and are less likely to attend school regularly and graduate high school on time.\n\nPoverty also tends to be self-replicating. According to the National Center for Children in Poverty, 82% of children whose parents didn’t have a high school diploma were living in low-income families. Thus, they were less likely to graduate high school themselves. Data also show a strong link between low educational attainment and high rates of substance abuse and incarceration, both of which make finding a way out of poverty more difficult.\n\nMost schools in South Dakota do not have many, if any, Native American teachers, which reduces the ability of Native students to make strong connections with adults in schools. Research has shown that having even one minority teacher in a school can boost learning for all students in that minority group.\n\nPart 2: Success for Native Americans isometimes found outside traditional schools\n\nSchool districts where Native Americans make up the majority of the student body also tend to be in remote, rural areas, said Julie Garreau, director of the Cheyenne River Youth Project and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. The youth project is a nonprofit that provides a variety of after-school programs and services to children in Eagle Butte on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in north-central South Dakota.\n\nSome rural districts do not have access to the same educational programs or job-training opportunities found in more urban districts such as Sioux Falls and Rapid City or even Aberdeen and Pierre. Transportation costs and time, teacher hiring and retention challenges, and restricted funding can also hamper rural districts where Natives commonly attend.\n\nFurthermore, a lack of post-graduation options in small communities where Native populations reside can indirectly hold students back. If students who are trying to figure out what they want to do after finishing high school – whether it’s finding a job, going to tech school or college or joining the military – don’t see realistic opportunities ahead, they can be prone to giving up on school and perhaps turning to substances for solace, Garreau said.\n\n“Kids are growing, they have a need to learn, they have a need to be active and to do things, and if that’s not there, I think any child will find something else to do,” Garreau said. “And sometimes that’s a negative activity.”\n\nSouth Dakota’s Native American population is not unique in facing challenges to getting a good education. Indigenous people across the country are struggling to close school-success gaps. In North Dakota, the graduation rate for Native American students was 72%, 20 points lower than that state’s white students. In Montana, Native American fourth and eighth graders were 20 to 30 points behind their white peers on the 2019 national assessment tests. The Native student populations in Montana and North Dakota make up roughly the same percentage of the overall student population as in South Dakota.\n\nIn South Dakota, there is new hope on the horizon. More school districts across the state have begun to implement pieces of the Oceti Sakowin Essential Understandings, a set of educational standards that seek to encourage schools to incorporate Lakota language, culture and history into everyday lessons. Lakota-language classes have been popping up in schools around the state, as well. In majority-Native districts such as Oglala Lakota County, teachers have started Lakota Immersion classrooms, which teach all their lessons in the Lakota language.\n\nMore than anything, schools are reaching out to Native communities, often for the first time, to find out what they want and need from schools, White Bull-Taken Alive said.\n\n“For so many years, everyone came in and told us how we were going to educate our kids,” she said. “It’s only now that Native American people have begun to stand up and say, ‘Hey, we want to teach our own kids.’”\n\nLast month, Department of Education Secretary Ben Jones announced the formation of a partnership with education-consulting firm McREL International to design and implement programs to improve Native American educational outcomes in the state. Those efforts, he said, could include a new look at culturally relevant curricula and efforts to improve Native American teacher recruitment.\n\nA push is also underway by the NDN Collective and other Native groups to pass legislation in 2020 to allow for development of the state’s first public charter schools that would provide educators the flexibility to innovate to better reach and teach Native students.\n\nThe complexity and magnitude of the challenge facing South Dakota’s Native American students certainly has created hurdles, but also provides a tremendous opportunity, Pierce said.\n\n“In South Dakota we are ground zero for indigenous education mobility,” she said.\n\nBecause there is so much room to grow, even incremental improvements to graduation rates, employment rates and college attendance could make a big impact on Native communities, both financially and socially, Pierce said. After all, economic fortunes have been shown to improve as educational attainment increases, she said.\n\n“There are huge financial implications to our communities as a result of this. That [financial impact] goes for reservations and urban areas in our state,” Pierce said.\n\nEnduring generations of trauma\n\nAs a high school freshman in Wagner about a decade ago, on the Yankton Indian Reservation in southeastern South Dakota, Alexander “Zane” Zephier found going to school nearly impossible.\n\nHe lived with his grandmother and younger brother and sister. Zephier’s mother, suffering from addiction and substance-abuse disorders, had left the family. His father was in prison. Zephier, a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, had bounced between schools in the towns of Lake Andes and Marty before going to Wagner in time to start sixth grade.\n\nWhen Zephier started high school, skipping class to stay home and play video games was easier than dealing with school on top of the other hardships in his life. Good grades didn’t seem to matter too much in the grand scheme of things. Zephier said he had no idea where he was going after high school.\n\nTrying to process the reality of his mother’s departure and his father’s absence wasn’t easy. He found it difficult to connect with other students and instead withdrew into himself. Eventually, Zephier did find some friends that came from similar circumstances and started drinking with them. The booze was in his community, unfortunately, a readily available coping mechanism, Zephier said.\n\nBy the time his grandmother started getting phone calls from the school threatening charges of truancy, Zephier said, he’d gotten so far behind that going back to class seemed impossible.\n\n“It was just kind of a vicious cycle,” Zephier said.\n\nZephier’s struggles are common in tribal communities. Native American students have the lowest attendance rate of any racial group in South Dakota at 72%, according to the DOE report card. Native children also have the highest rate of chronic absenteeism of any racial group in the state at 37%.\n\nWhile many factors play into whether any child, indigenous or not, will show up at school every day, Native communities have the added burden of a long history of historical, cultural and societal trauma. Zephier’s story is one example of the impact such historical trauma can have on Native students.\n\nNo other group of Americans has as troubled a past with government-funded education than the country’s indigenous population. In 1819 Congress passed the Civilization Fund Act, which appropriated $10,000 (about $202,000 in today’s dollars) to teach Native Americans “the habits and arts of civilization.” The money was mostly allocated to religious groups to fund mission schools on the country’s frontier.\n\nBy the 1870s, most of the country’s indigenous population had been conquered and forced onto remote reservations. That decade also saw the beginning of the federal government’s notorious Indian boarding-school program. Native American children were forced to attend federally funded boarding schools that systematically stripped them of their cultural identity through a combination of harsh discipline and forced religion.\n\nGenerations of Native youths as young as six were required, by law, to attend schools where their hair was cut, their clothes were replaced by military-style uniforms and they were denied the right to speak their own languages. School instructors routinely disciplined students physically and mentally for even minor infractions. Often, these schools were hundreds or thousands of miles away from their families.\n\n“In theory it was supposed to be this great tool for assimilation, and we would all coexist together. But what it really did was, it compromised indigenous culture in a way that we’re still repairing,” said Pierce.\n\nThe stated goal behind forced Indian education was, literally, to quash Native American culture under the notion that doing so would eventually lead Native Americans to assimilate into American society. Education at Indian boarding schools was usually trade-focused for boys and focused on domestic chores and skills for girls. Reading, writing and math were taught, too, but the idea was to give Native children practical skills that could lead to jobs in cities or in agriculture.\n\nRacism often prevented former boarding-school students from finding work in American cities, Pierce said. Often, those former boarding-school students were driven back to the reservations where they came from and where opportunities were few.\n\n“There weren’t industries on the reservation conducive to those trades, and so what happened then is, they go back to the reservations, and they would feel super isolated because they didn’t have deep understandings of their culture, language and spirituality,” Pierce said.\n\nIn the end, the federal system of boarding schools failed to erase Native culture or force Native Americans to assimilate. What the boarding schools did instead was create several generations of traumatized youths with tenuous connections to their culture, history and families. Many turned to alcohol as a way to self-medicate for serious mental health problems, Pierce said.\n\n“If you’re using alcohol to adapt and address some deep mental health issues, and then you start having a family, getting married, having children, when your children misbehave or you and your spouse disagree, you address it in ways that you learned … the boarding-school movement really yielded chemical dependency, extreme mental health issues, abuse both physically and sexually. There’s just a long list of issues,” Pierce said.\n\nUntil the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, Native Americans hadn’t been granted automatic citizenship at birth (though some Natives were able to become citizens.) The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which grants nearly anyone born within the country’s borders citizenship, had been interpreted by Congress and the courts to exclude indigenous people. Native Americans were instead considered almost as wards of the state.\n\nThose who had been granted citizenship and were born before 1924 had to give up their tribal affiliations, join the military and accept land grants carved out of reservation lands, and start paying taxes on the land. That system led to tribes’ losing hundreds of thousands of acres from reservations to private ownership. Often the lands were sold off to non-Native buyers.\n\nFull citizenship wasn’t granted to all Native Americans until 1948. By the 1950s, nationally, about half of all Native American children were being educated in locally controlled public schools. But Native Americans still had little say in what and how their children were taught in those schools. The same was true of the federally managed BIA schools.\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, tribal governments started taking on a larger role in the education of their children. They began taking over boarding schools and creating new partnerships with local school districts using federal grants authorized by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, as well as the Tribally Controlled Grant Schools Act of 1988.\n\nForced placement in boarding schools wasn’t ended until 1978, when Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act.\n\nZephier, for his part, said he was able to graduate high school in 2013 and go to college thanks to the teachers and students in the Wagner High School Jobs for America’s Graduates program. He was automatically enrolled in the program as a freshman because the school deemed him to be at high risk of dropping out due to his family history. Zephier was joined by 12 other students, all of whom had similar backgrounds, in his JAG class.\n\nWith help from lead JAG teacher Renee Van Der Werff, who students saw as a mother figure, the class became a second family, Zephier said. His classmates became an essential support system and kept him connected to school even as he struggled with drinking. Ven Der Werff, meanwhile was able to provide individual help to Zephier and his fellow JAG students with school work and in completing applications for summer programs and even college.\n\nZephier couldn’t pinpoint exactly when he committed to breaking out of the cycle of poverty and substance abuse that had plagued his parents but he credits the stability he found in the JAG program for giving him the emotional space to think about his future and his siblings’ future.\n\n“I constantly worried about the world they would grow up in when I was in high school. Those thoughts used to keep me awake at night and give me nightmares. I always thought to myself, ‘If I can’t make it out of here, how can I expect them to?’” Zephier said. “I also wanted to build a life that when I had my own family, my children would never have to know what it’s like to grow up without parents or any of the things I had to witness and endure in my upbringing.”\n\nZephier, now 24, graduated from the University of South Dakota in 2017 after having served in student government. Zephier now works as a field counselor for USD’s Upward Bound program, which helps low-income high school students graduate and explore college opportunities.\n\nHis brother and sister, though, have both struggled. Zephier said his sister dropped out of high school and his brother has been sent to a juvenile-detention facility. He hasn’t been able to speak with his brother or sister for a while, but he worries about them constantly and hopes they’ll be able to make a good life for themselves. Unfortunately, his siblings’ experience is common on reservations, Zephier said, and it’s not something that will be easy or quick to change.\n\n“I don’t know how you fix generations of trauma,” Zephier said.\n\nCulture an essential piece of education\n\nStates and the nation as a whole have done little to make restitution or even acknowledge how the federal government treated Native Americans from the nation’s founding through much of the 20th century through policies that amounted to genocide, Pierce said. Unless and until that acknowledgement is made, she said, healing the bitterness many Native Americans feel toward the rest of American society will be next to impossible. Without that acknowledgement and healing, getting Native children to engage with the education system will continue to be problematic, Pierce said.\n\n“We’ve never really recognized collectively, the genocide of indigenous peoples here,” Pierce said. “There’s a lot of historical trauma in that.”\n\nOne step in the right direction, said Pierce, would be to create school environments where Native American students can be unapologetically indigenous. In other words, she said, the state’s schools need to do a better job of creating an environment where Native American students can celebrate and be proud of who they are.\n\nPierce, who became a Bush Foundation Fellow in spring 2019, is focusing her work on the concept of “cultural safety.” The term refers to how comfortable people feel expressing their cultural heritage and identity in public places. South Dakota has a long way to go when it comes to creating more culturally safe school environments, Pierce said.\n\nA recent, widely reported example of a lack of cultural safety in South Dakota occurred in May 2019 at Brookings High School. The school principal confiscated an eagle feather, which has tremendous significance in Lakota culture as a symbol of accomplishment, that was attached to a Native American student’s cap right before the school’s graduation ceremony. The confiscation was illegal under a state law passed in 2018. Still, the principal insisted that the student give up the feather.\n\nThe student was eventually able to walk across the stage and receive his diploma while wearing the eagle feather he’d earned by graduating from high school – but only after the feather had been given to his mother, who found him and reattached the feather to his cap. Later, the Brookings School District formally apologized to the student.\n\nStudents, no matter what their race or religion, need to be able to be who they are without having to explain themselves at every turn, Pierce said. The state is getting better in that arena, she said, if only slowly.\n\nWhite Bull-Taken Alive, head of the state Office of Indian Education, said each school’s culture also plays a big role in how successful children of any background can be. Unfortunately, she said, there is often a culture of low expectations when it comes to Native American students.\n\n“Actually hearing people say that Native kids can’t learn or this work is too hard, that’s devastating. Can you just imagine the trauma or the devastation to understand that, here is your trusted adult saying that, you know, Native kids can’t learn this,” White Bull-Taken Alive said.\n\nNative American students also tend to be disciplined in South Dakota schools at much higher rates than their peers.\n\nAccording to the most recent data reported by the federal Civil Rights Data Collection system within the Department of Education, despite Native Americans’ being roughly 10% of South Dakota’s student population, they made up more than 30% of both in-school and out-of-school suspensions as well as roughly 54% of expulsions during the 2015-16 school year, the latest year for which data is available.\n\nOf the 221 violent incidents reported in the state’s schools, 50 involved Native Americans. A total of 127 violent incidents involved white students. There were 123 Native American students arrested in South Dakota public schools, accounting for roughly 45% of the 270 arrests reported in the state’s schools. A total of 109 white students were arrested in schools.\n\n“The discipline data is indicative of the need for more culturally proficient strategies,” Pierce said.\n\nUltimately, small improvements may help, but many believe that sweeping changes will be needed to the South Dakota public education system before outcomes improve significantly for Native students, Pierce said.\n\nJones, a former college dean who became state education secretary in January 2019, said he was not sure why it has taken so long to embrace Native American perspectives and input on education. Jones said he was optimistic that with strong input from Native leaders, educators and families, South Dakota can find a way to improve education outcomes for Native American students.\n\n“For many years Native American (education) improvement has been an objective, and there’s been various things tried … it brings to mind a Winston Churchill quote: ‘You can always rely on the United States to do the right thing after they have tried everything else,’” Jones said. “Regarding Native American education, we’ve tried a wide variety of things, and now we’re going to try and listen to them and see how they’d like to approach it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/04/11/which-states-cost-the-most-in-lifetime-taxes/73279496007/", "title": "Which states cost the most in lifetime taxes? - USA Today", "text": "April 11, 2024 Updated July 18, 2024, 12:28 p.m. ET\n\nWith Tax Day approaching, here’s a sobering thought: The average American pays $524,625 in taxes in their lifetime, according to a new study.\n\nThe report also ranks states on lifetime tax costs. And if you live in the Northeast, you may want to sit down for this:\n\nNew Jersey residents pay $987,117 in lifetime taxes, the analysis found, the highest tab in the nation. Washington, D.C., comes second, with a lifetime tax burden of $884,820. Connecticut and Massachusetts are third and fourth, at $855,307 and $816,700.\n\nThe lowest-tax state is West Virginia, with a lifetime cost of $358,407.\n\nThe report comes from the personal finance site Self Financial, based on research collected in January and February 2024. It considers taxes on income, homes, cars, clothing, food, drink, entertainment and personal care, drawing from tax data and several research sources, including the American Community Survey, the federal Consumer Expenditure Survey and Zillow.\n\nThe lifetime tax figure, $524,625, works out to about one-third of the average American's lifetime earnings, which add up to roughly $1.5 million.\n\nTaxation is on many people’s minds, given the looming April 15 federal tax deadline.\n\n“Around this time of year, everybody has this come-to-Jesus moment: ‘Omigod, does it make sense to stay in the state of California, or the state of Connecticut, or the state of New Jersey?’” said Katy Song, chief financial planner at Domain Money.\n\nMany Americans are moving from high-tax to low-tax states\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic allowed many workers to live far from employers. Millions of Americans have migrated from state to state in the pandemic years, untethered from the office by the remote-work boom.\n\nThe number of people who moved between states rose from roughly 7.4 million in 2019 to 8.2 million in 2022, according to census data.\n\nNew Jersey, the state with the highest taxes in the Self Financial report, lost the most residents to other states in 2023, according to the annual National Movers Study from United Van Lines.\n\nFive other high-tax states − California, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts and New York − rank in the top eight for outbound migration in the 2023 study.\n\nAmericans moved to several low-tax states in 2023, including Alabama, Arkansas, New Mexico, North and South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia.\n\nThe quest for lower taxes “has clearly factored into the migration,” said Chester Spatt, professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n“You look at the outflow from California, for example,” a state ranked ninth for lifetime taxes in the Self Financial report. “California never used to have outflow.”\n\nMost affordable states in 2024: See our study at USA TODAY Homefront\n\nNine states levy no income tax. Not all are low-tax states\n\nOne earmark of a low-tax state is the absence of a state income tax. Nine states don’t have one: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.\n\nYet not all of those states rate as low-tax destinations in the Self Financial analysis. Washington state, for example, has relatively high sales and property taxes, as well as one of the nation’s highest estate taxes.\n\n“Washington state does not have an income tax. So you’re going, ‘Wow, what a great state to move my family,’” said Daniel Rahill, a CPA at Wintrust Wealth Management. “Well, Washington has about the highest estate tax. So, when you die, they’re going to make up for it.”\n\nWhen Brent Weiss moved his family from Maryland to Florida three years ago, state taxes “definitely factored into the decision,” he said. “If I made a list of five things I wanted, taxes was absolutely on that list.”\n\nWeiss is head of financial wellness at Facet, a financial planning firm.\n\nGiven his expertise, Weiss also knew that Florida’s low-tax economy came with a cost. Florida spends less per pupil on public education than most other states. People who live on the water often face massive insurance bills.\n\n“The next thing you know,” he said, “the tax benefits are offset by these higher costs.”\n\nHigh-tax states offer perks of their own\n\nHigh-tax states, by contrast, can offer perks that low-tax states lack.\n\nStates with a larger tax base “may be investing more in things like education, roads and health care,” said Andy Phillips, director of agency and industry relations and virtual tax services at The Tax Institute at H&R Block.\n\nJobs in high-tax states often pay better wages, tax experts say.\n\nOne advantage to the high-tax region around New York is the concentration of jobs in finance. California’s Silicon Valley boasts a cluster of tech jobs.\n\n“The clustering and critical mass is important,” said Spatt, of Carnegie Mellon. “Workers like to be in markets where they have alternatives.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/09/u-s-life-expectancy-decline-overdoses-liver-disease-suicide/1680854001/", "title": "US life expectancy on decline; opioid epidemic, liver disease, suicide", "text": "Uptin Saiidi\n\nCNBC\n\nUpdated July 9, 2019, 3:00 p.m. ET\n\nA baby born in the U.S. in 2017 is expected to live to be 78.6 years old, which is down from 78.7 from the year before.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified three primary causes for the decline in life expectancy.\n\nThe average life expectancy in the U.S. has been on the decline for three consecutive years.\n\nA baby born in 2017 is expected to live to be 78.6 years old, which is down from 78.7 the year before, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nThe last three years represent the longest consecutive decline in the American lifespan at birth since the period between 1915 and 1918, which included World War I and the Spanish Flu pandemic, events that killed many millions worldwide.\n\nBefore the recent decline, life expectancy had been steadily rising in the U.S. – which is to be expected of an advanced nation, particularly one that spends more money per citizen on health care than any other country.\n\nLife expectancy varies by neighborhood: The gap is huge, study says\n\nThe U.S. isn’t alone. A study projected the U.K. lifespan will shorten by about five months. While life expectancy is still on the rise in France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, those countries have also seen a sharp slowdown.\n\nWhile there’s no single cause for the decline in the U.S., a report by the CDC highlights three factors contributing to the decline.\n\nA rise in drug overdoses\n\nIn 2017, more than 70,000 deaths occurred because of drug overdoses. Opioids were involved in more than 47,000 of those.\n\nThe age-adjusted death rate for drug overdose in the U.S. rose 72% within a decade.\n\nWhen the CDC analyzed data from emergency room visits, it found that opioid overdoses went up a whopping 30% in the U.S. from July 2016 and September 2017.\n\nLifesaving overdose drug: Pharmacists slow to dispense\n\nOpioids continue to be prescribed at triple the amount they were in 1999, but many are hoping to change that. The federal government has spent more than $2.4 billion in state grants since 2017 in a bid to curb the epidemic.\n\nCDC data shows the number of opioid prescriptions, while still high, is now declining.\n\nAn increase in liver disease\n\nOver a 10-year period, the death rate for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis among men aged 25 to 34 increased by nearly 8% per year, while women in the same age group increased more than 11% per year.\n\nThe causes of liver disease can vary, from genetics to alcohol consumption and obesity.\n\nA rise in suicide rates\n\nThe national suicide rate has increased by 33% since 1999. In 2017 alone, that rate went up by 3.7%.\n\nThe global suicide rate, meanwhile, has declined by almost 30% since 2000, with the rates in Russia, Japan, South Korea and India falling significantly over the last decade.\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Doctors tried to resuscitate the child – with ventilation, cardiac compressions, chest tubes and other methods – to no avail. The neonatologist later discovered that the mother had a previously undiagnosed case of syphilis.\n\nThe baby’s death at a Wisconsin hospital illustrates some the dangers babies face in their first year of life. It's also the type of scenario doctors are examining as they try to understand a grim new trend. For the first time in two decades, the number of U.S. infants who died in their first year of life is on the rise, according to provisional data from the National Center for Health Statistics, or NCHS.\n\n“We don’t live in a vacuum,” Dr. Dennis Costakos, director of neonatal and perinatal medicine at the Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin, told USA TODAY. “The health of the baby is often directly related to the health of the mother.”\n\nExperts consider infant mortality a key indicator of overall population health. The latest federal statistics reflect a jump in the death rate for just one year, 2022; however, they raise concerns because the U.S. has also failed in other key population metrics: maternal mortality rate has increased and the average life expectancy is declining.\n\nBlack Maternal Health Week: Experts call out factors making pregnancy far less safe for Black people in America\n\nIncreases 'add up to general trend'\n\nThe NCHS report marks the first statistically significant increase in infant deaths since 2002. Before this report, the U.S. had seen a 22% decline in child deaths over 20 years, although the U.S. continually had higher infant death rates than other high-income countries.\n\nThe change in 2022 data represents a notable moment for public health officials: an increase to 5.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 5.44 in 2021.\n\n“All of these increases, even the small increases, they all just add up to a general trend,” report author Danielle Ely, an NCHS health statistician, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe report used figures from the National Vital Statistics System of birth and death records across 50 states and the District of Columbia for children's first year of life. The provisional figures will be finalized in a report expected next spring. However, its authors decided to release the data early to provide a warning to healthcare providers and officials of the growing trend.\n\nThe figures also correspond with the child poverty rate doubling in 2022. Another factor for providers to consider: expanded Medicaid coverage that was available during the COVID-19 pandemic has been cut.\n\nKeeping women and children in good health has to be a conscientious, proactive undertaking said Georgia Machell, interim president and CEO of the National WIC Association, a nonprofit that represents nutrition service provider agencies that implement the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for the Women, Infants and Children program.\n\n“There needs to be investment in the safeguards in order to support families to reduce infant mortality,” Machell said.\n\nReport details: what did researchers find?\n\nThe increase in 2022 infant deaths spanned several demographic groups, with some demographic groups being spared.\n\nThe largest statistical uptick in infant deaths was among babies born to Native American and non-Hispanic white women between 2021 and 2022 – for Indigenous infants, from 7.46 to 9.06 per 1,000 births, and for white infants, from 4.36 to 4.52. The infant death rate among children born to Black women climbed from 10.55 to 10.86. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders also saw a small rise in infant deaths (from 7.76 to 8.5), as did Hispanic people (4.79 to 4.88), though deaths of infants born to Asian American women declined, from 3.69 to 3.5.\n\nAdditionally, there were rises in the death rates of babies born preterm – at less than 37 weeks gestation – as well as the rates of infants who died less than 28 days after birth, and those who died 28 days or more into their first year. There were small increases in death rates of babies of mothers 24 and younger and babies born to women 30 to 39. And there was a significant jump in deaths of babies born to mothers 25 to 29.\n\nAmong the 10 leading causes of death for babies, maternal complications and bacterial sepsis saw increases in mortalities, the report said.\n\nThese states saw biggest rise in infant mortality rates\n\nThe deaths were far higher in some regions of the country: Georgia, Iowa, Missouri and Texas saw significant increases in infant mortality rates.\n\nSeveral of these states moved to restrict abortion access since the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, though experts warned it may be too soon to gauge any correlation between restricted access to reproductive healthcare and infant mortality.\n\n“Any time we see it trending in the wrong direction, our alarm bells are going off,” said Dr. Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health and a demographer, in a phone interview.\n\nGemmill has forthcoming research suggesting there was a rise in infant and neonatal mortality in Texas after lawmakers in 2021 enacted Senate Bill 8, a law banning abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAmong high-income countries, the U.S. spends far more on healthcare, yet it has the highest infant and maternal death rate, a recent study from the Commonwealth Fund found. In the U.S., maternal mortality rates have jumped in recent years, particularly among Black and Native women. Black women had death rates nearly three as high as non-Hispanic white women.\n\nThe latest national figures are alarming for Dr. Ayman El-Mohandes, dean of the City University of New York’s Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, but he said it is far more alarming that the U.S. has been unable to significantly reduce its mortality rate below what it was in 2000, when 6.89 out of 1,000 births resulted in a baby dying in its first year. Since 2000, infant deaths in the U.S. only declined by one per 1,000 births.\n\nThe American infant mortality rate of 5.6 per 1,000 births is about three times as high as Norway's, which El-Mohandes said is notable.\n\n“We need to know who we are comparing ourselves to,” El-Mohandes said, “and what infant mortality can look like.”\n\nThe U.S. has put spacecraft on Mars in the past two decades, El-Mohandes said. He hopes the country puts equal emphasis on reducing the number of babies who die before their first birthday.\n\nEduardo Cuevas covers health and breaking news for USA TODAY.

It could also be politically contentious for elected leaders and the residents they serve if the city decides to boost pension payments at the expense of other investments such as public safety and blight removal.\n\nThe original balloon payment was calculated with help from the pension consultant used by former Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr, a gubernatorial appointee who ruled the city for almost two years including its time in bankruptcy court. Reached Friday, Orr declined to comment about revised pension projections for this report, saying he had not reviewed them.\n\nBut the actuaries for the city's two pensions funds say the lower estimate used in the bankruptcy plan was based on outdated information, including projections that didn't allow for the longer life expectancy of retirees or that the city would be hiring new employees after filing for bankruptcy who would need to become part of the pension system.\n\nIs Detroit already heading into another pension hole?\n\nThe old calculation also was based on pension cuts taking effect in June 2014, instead of nine months later in March, which underestimated the liability for the pension system, officials from the Gabriel Roeder Smith & Co. actuarial firm told its Detroit pension fund clients in recent weeks.\n\nOthers argue the issue is more than manageable, even if Detroit decides to make bigger pension payments sooner. The city's post-bankruptcy budget was designed with a surplus for contingencies, which Orr predicted would be $100 million before he left the city in December 2014.\n\n\"While the books are not yet closed on FY 2014-15, the projected budget surplus for that year exceeds the emergency manager's original estimates,\" Finance Director John Naglick said in an e-mail Friday.\n\nCity coffers could also grow, improving the city's ability to pay in the future. Returns on pension investments over the next nine years may outpace expectations, lowering the city's estimated payment.\n\nTime for more pension payments?\n\nActuaries advising the pension funds insist there is a significant risk of keeping to the original payment schedule and not adding more money: \"Every potential action\" should be pursued, they say, to provide additional funding into the funds well before 2024.\n\n\"If not, there could be significant risk of contribution defaults and/or further benefits cuts,\" Gabriel Roeder, the actuarial firm that has advised Detroit’s pension trustees for 75 years, concluded in a new draft report presented to one of the city's two pension boards last week.\n\n​The revised estimate still counts on the pension funds’ assets earning 6.75% a year on its investments agreed to by the city's emergency manager and pension officials in bankruptcy mediation talks.\n\nEarly returns weak\n\nInstead, the funds this year are both on track to earn less than 5%, according to pension fund officials. A lower average rate of return over the next several years could further inflate the city’s pension fund obligations starting in 2024 and beyond.\n\nThe city has two pension funds — one for police and fire employees and one for non-uniformed employees — that cover more than 25,000 retirees and active city workers.\n\nUnder the bankruptcy plan, general pensioners were hit with 4.5% cuts, the elimination of annual cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) increases, and a clawback of excessive interest from annuity savings. Police and fire pensioners saw a reduction only in their COLA increases.\n\nWithout an $816-million payment from a group of local and national foundations, Detroit Institute of Arts and state lawmakers, dubbed the \"grand bargain,\" the pension cuts would have been much worse, city leaders say. In exchange for the financial support, DIA masterpieces were protected from being sold to pay off city debt, and the institute was spun off into its own independent nonprofit to be forever shielded from city finances.\n\nOriginal forecasts submitted in the bankruptcy case showed the city paying roughly $92 million into the pension funds from now through 2024 plus help from the proceeds from the grand bargain.\n\nMayor Mike Duggan said in an interview this month he remains unhappy with the size of Detroit's pension obligation.\n\nAfter living under a budget largely preset by the city's former emergency manager, the mayor and city council will assume a greater control of the city's budget process starting next spring even as a separate financial review commission has the final say.\n\nDetroit chief financial officer John Hill said in a separate interview that revised estimates produced by the pension's actuaries could prompt the city to make payments earlier than expected.\n\nBut he cautioned there's also a risk to making early payments because if good money is poured into pension funds ahead of schedule but the market does not perform well, or even loses ground, it could cost the city more in the long run.\n\n“If you pay more now, it only helps you if the plan earns more money than you expect it to,” he said during an interview earlier this month. “If you put money in the plan and it loses, then you’re going to owe more and the amount you put in would’ve been better sitting in your account than it would’ve been sitting in the pension fund.”\n\nHiring an expert\n\nHill said the city intends to hire an outside firm to help the city test various actuarial assumptions and help the city determine how much it owes the pension funds.\n\n“I’m pretty confident that we’re going to come up with a reasoned solution that will have us continue to be in compliance with the plan of adjustment,” Hill said. “We recognize that this is a liability — no question — for the city and it’s a responsibility that we have as a city and it’s something that we agreed to do.”\n\nIn an interview, Gov. Rick Snyder, who authorized the city's bankruptcy filing more than two years ago, said he believes it's a \"normal process\" to commission and absorb the findings of updated actuarial reports.\n\n\"I view it as prudent that you do this,\" said Synder, who is also a certified public accountant. \"So if you have an issue, you can identify it years out and do something about it.\"\n\nHe said that his administration has not shied away from trying to tackle the pension funding gap issue.\n\n\"I never underestimate long-term liabilities,\" he said. \"As a state, I think we’ve done a good job to address them.\"\n\nCleaned-up balance sheet\n\nDetroit's original pension obligation estimated at $3.5 billion was one of the key reasons used to justify its historic bankruptcy, the largest-ever municipal filing in the nation.\n\nTo be sure, there were other problems with the city's balance sheet. Compared with pensions, the city's retiree health care system was cut much more deeply at roughly 90%. Other creditors were paid less than 10 cents on the dollar.\n\nIn the end, an estimated $7 billion of the city's $18 billion in long-term liabilities was eliminated as part of the city's plan of adjustment. About $1.7 billion of the cuts came from pensions.\n\nSupporters of the bankruptcy plan also argue that new accounting changes smartly eliminated a widespread practice across the nation of low-balling pension contributions to force greater payments in the future. The change in Detroit is meant to inject more reality into what the city's true obligations are, even though the positive results of paying into the funds won't be seen for years down the road.\n\nBut the expensive, 18-month-long restructuring was also billed as a financial reckoning day to help prevent Detroit from facing future balloon payments it could no longer afford. It was a $39.7-million missed payment in June 2013 on debt issued to bolster its pensions that served as precursor to the city's filing for Chapter 9 protection weeks later.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy adjustment deal, Detroit was to be given a break in funding its pensions directly through 2023 in part because of the massive grand bargain aid package worth $816 million largely making up the difference.\n\nNegotiators feared rejecting the deal might lead to further benefit cuts. The deal approved in a vote by city employees and retirees was also greased by a rosy projection for improved pension fund returns due to the stock market’s performance in 2013, further reducing the city's anticipated liabilities estimated by Orr's team in conjunctions with unions and retiree groups.\n\nBut assumptions adopted only a year ago may have led to a sharp miscalculation.\n\nRetirees living longer\n\nPart of the reason for the new spike in projected pension payments? An updated mortality table for city workers and retirees used to calculate how long retirees are expected to live and receive pension benefits.\n\nMilliman, hired by the city under emergency manager Orr, used older tables, according to the pension funds' own actuaries. A Milliman spokesman said in an e-mail Friday that \"we have a longstanding policy not to comment on our client work.\"\n\nBut Gabriel Roeder officials said they applied updated calculations in their new reports.\n\n\"Many of the changes we've made here,\" Gabriel Roeder's Kenneth Alberts told the city's police and fire pension system board of trustees at a meeting Wednesday, \"were mandated by the city's plan of adjustment bankruptcy plan.\"\n\nEarly warning signs\n\nHow much of this increase should have been anticipated? Experts warned early on that the ability of Detroit to know its true pension obligations was always unsteady even as the city was set to emerge from bankruptcy.\n\nMartha Kopacz, who analyzed the plan for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes and found the city's plan feasible, cautioned in her report last year that the city must be \"continually mindful that a root cause of the financial troubles it now experiences is the failure to properly address future pension obligations.\"\n\nBut she also conceded that \"despite the relative importance, the magnitude of the city’s retirement obligations and the methods for calculating them are largely unknown.\"\n\nOne major risk, she concluded, was that the pension plans are \"not able to defer plan payments during down markets, and therefore, in significant down markets, the loss of principal as a result of making payments to pensioners, without offsetting investment returns, can result in a plan that “locks in” losses. These 'locked in' losses create underfunding.\"\n\nThat, among other factors, led Rhodes to conclude last year that his greatest concern for the city “arises from the risks that the city retains relating to pension funding.”\n\nHow can we afford this?\n\nHow might the city pay its looming pension bills? It is possible that Detroit's financial position will be much better in 2024, giving the city a much greater ability to pay its pensions, even an inflated bill.\n\nBut some say the city's budget — $1.1 billion for the 2015-16 fiscal year — could still be tight in the coming years, making the possibility of any new pension fund spending a challenge. In that case, Detroit could be forced to shift money away from city services in the next 10 years in order to shore up pensions if an increase in municipal revenues can't cover the difference.\n\nSome in Detroit remain worried about the fragile state of the city's nascent recovery.\n\n\"We’re nowhere out of the woods,\" former Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said in a recent interview. \"A lot of people say we’re no longer in bankruptcy, so things must be great.\"\n\nBing said that isn't the case. He praised the work of the bankruptcy leaders and the city's resurgence in downtown and Midtown. But he added, \"All you have to do is go into any neighborhood and ask somebody 'are things better for you' and 99% of the people would probably say no.\"\n\nThe city's financial review commission, a body charged with keeping the city on track with its bankruptcy-exit plan, discussed pensions in its May report but did not foresee the larger balloon payment estimated in documents revealed last week.\n\nThe revision for the year 2024 from Gabriel Roeder — $81 million greater than the forecast in the plan — is considered solid enough to be cited in the draft of an upcoming report from Detroit's financial watchdog commission to be submitted to Snyder by Dec. 1, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nMissed opportunity?\n\nSome critics say Detroit missed a critical opportunity to restructure its entire retirement system to relieve the city of a risk it can ill-afford.\n\nAmong them is the Detroit bankruptcy judge who found the city's original plan to be feasible.\n\nIn an interview, Rhodes said that the city may have missed a cost-saving and risk-reducing opportunity in bankruptcy to move all city workers to a 401(k)-style retirement system built in part on employee contributions.\n\nInstead, the city kept its defined-benefit pension plan for older workers and retirees and moved newer workers into a so-called hybrid plan intended to shift some risk to a smaller number of employees.\n\n\"I did approve that as a reasonable settlement,\" Rhodes said in an interview. But he said the vestiges of the city's defined-benefit pension leave a substantial risk on the city's shoulders alone.\n\n\"So I did think it was a missed opportunity,\" he added.\n\nBut Orr, one of the bankruptcy plan's chief architects, defended the direct-benefit pension system in an interview late last month. He argued it was substantially reformed as part of a compromise with pension funds and labor unions during the bankruptcy mediation that sped the city's exit from bankruptcy.\n\nHe said it remains an important entitlement to city workers, many of whom receive wages and salaries below the private sector. For new city workers, Detroit started a hybrid system expected to reduce the city's financial burden, aiding its ability to pay all of its obligations.\n\n\"The reality is that it is a compromise solution,\" Orr said.\n\nContact Matthew Dolan: 313-223-4743 or msdolan@freepress.com.

He tested negative on July 26 and 27, prompting him to end isolation. But three days later, on July 30, the president again tested positive and returned to isolation. Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said his symptoms hadn't reappeared.\n\nRebound infections after taking Paxlovid can occur. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, experienced a similar rebound infection. Most people, however, aren’t tested as often as the president and the actual rate of rebound cases is probably around 5%, White House COVID response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said in a series of tweets.\n\nIt's not clear whether a rebound after taking the antiviral Paxlovid is any different than a rebound without the drug. In the trial that led to Paxlovid's authorization, the percentage of people who developed rebound infections was similar among those who took the medication and those who didn't.\n\nA preprint study posted Tuesday found 27% of people who recovered from COVID-19 saw a rebound in symptoms regardless of whether they were treated with Paxlovid. The study has yet to be peer-reviewed.\n\nAlso in the news:\n\n► The CDC may update its COVID-19 guidance, including in schools, easing quarantine recommendations and de-emphasizing regular testing, according to a CNN report.\n\n► A federally sponsored study found neutralizing antibodies against omicron decrease substantially within three months of getting a COVID-19 booster.\n\n► The U.S. government has secured 66 million doses of Moderna’s new booster vaccine targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 strain of the omicron variant, according to a company statement.\n\n► A large study looking at Californians' life expectancy from 2015 to 2021 found it declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 81.4 to 78.37 years.\n\n📘What we're reading: Are these furry creatures to blame for the COVID pandemic?

In July, more than 12,500 Americans died of COVID-19.\n\n“We’re sitting on this horrible plateau,” said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist with Pro Health Care in New York and a clinical instructor of medicine at Columbia University.\n\nMost Americans who died of COVID-19 were immunocompromised or older than 75, experts said. These patients ranged in vaccination status – from unvaccinated to receiving all recommended vaccines and boosters.\n\nWhat appears to make the biggest difference between patients who recover from COVID-19 or die, Griffin said, is whether they receive treatment within the first week of diagnosis.\n\nStudy finds racial and ethnic disparities in COVID booster uptake\n\nAs it became clear the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing health disparities, officials invested in concentrated, programmatic efforts to narrow the gap. But a recent report shows those disparities continued with booster uptake.\n\nAs of March, Black people were 15% less likely to receive a booster and Hispanic people were 21% less likely when compared to the population average. Asian people were 24% more likely to get their booster and white people were 7% more likely, according to the study published Monday in Health Affairs.\n\n“Across doses, we found large racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake,” study authors wrote. “Vaccinations drive outcomes: Relative to those who have received boosters, morality rates are 78 times higher for those who are unvaccinated.”\n\nBooster uptake across all racial and ethnic groups followed similar trends as first doses, except among Hispanics. While they were least likely to get a booster, the number of Hispanics who got first doses was 26% higher than the population average.\n\n“Vaccination campaigns focused on Hispanic people may want to promote booster doses to address low rates of uptake among a population that has demonstrated both the willingness to receive and the ability to obtain first doses,” study authors wrote.\n\nNursing homes fail to replace staff that quit amid COVID outbreaks\n\nNursing home staffs shrunk in the weeks and months after severe COVID-19 outbreaks, according to a new study, and federal data shows most facilities lost more than half their nurses and aides in the past year.\n\nThe study found facilities have struggled to refill openings, particularly certified nursing assistants, who provide most bedside care – findings that both complicate and underscore the need for President Biden’s push to establish nationwide staffing-level requirements.\n\nIncreased nurse staffing is linked to better health outcomes for nursing-home residents, with registered nurses playing a particularly important role in managing the spread of infectious diseases. That reality gained broader significance during the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased public awareness of nursing-home shortfalls.\n\nThe pandemic also brought attention to the challenges faced by nursing-home workers, who historically have been paid less than their counterparts in hospitals or government-run health programs.\n\n– Jayme Fraser, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY.

The showing was the first time the president, her family and close friends saw the film in full, said Marc Beckman, the first lady’s outside adviser and agent.\n\nThe film offers rare behind-the-scenes access to the first lady, who has kept a low public profile during her husband’s second term. The trailer opens on Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, 2025, showing her donning a navy wide-brimmed hat for the ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. It also depicts her role as an adviser to the president, including a moment in which she encourages him to emphasize “peacemaker and unifier” in his inaugural address.\n\nThe East Room screening followed the president's tariff threat to Canada, defense of federal agents after a fatal shooting during Minnesota protests, and preparation for a winter storm barreling through the U.S.\n\nAbout 70 people across the cultural spectrum attended, including former professional boxer Mike Tyson and Jordan's Queen Rania, who is seen in the film's trailer, a person familiar with the event said.\n\nNeed a news break?

Beckman said viewers also will see moments that capture the president's sense of humor.\n\nAhead of the theatrical release of the film, the president and first lady will attend a premiere on Jan. 29, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center by the Trump-appointed board of directors.\n\nThe first lady is also scheduled to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 28 to promote the film.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/politics/ivanka-trump-election-challenge-documentary", "title": "Ivanka Trump told documentary maker Trump should pursue ... - CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIvanka Trump, daughter and former senior White House adviser to then-President Donald Trump, said in an interview filmed in mid-December 2020 that her father should “continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted,” according to a source familiar with the footage.\n\nIvanka Trump said in the interview clip, which was first reported by The New York Times, that her father should do so because people were questioning “the sanctity of our elections,” the source confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe video clip, which has not been viewed by CNN but its contents confirmed by a source familiar with it, was among the footage handed over to the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack by British filmmaker Alex Holder, who acknowledged Tuesday that he has complied with a subpoena from panel.\n\nIvanka Trump, told the committee during her closed door interview that she believed former Attorney General William Barr when he said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election, according to a clip from the deposition with the panel played for the first time during a previous public hearing.

The documentary says the then-vice president was shown a draft of the House resolution demanding that Pence invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power.\n\nBut a Pence spokesman said that characterization was false. “In the documentary, Vice President Pence was reacting to a confirmation that his letter was sent to Speaker Pelosi rejecting her ploy to invoke 25th amendment,” the Pence spokesman said.\n\nIn the clip, Pence notes the time of the email, 7:48. That is the exact time that the White House press office sent out Pence’s letter that evening, according to a copy of the email that CNN received at the time.\n\nNews of the letter was reported not long afterward.\n\n“Last week, I did not yield to pressure to exert power beyond my constitutional authority to determine the outcome of the election, and I will not now yield to efforts in the House of Representatives to play political games at a time so serious in the life of our nation,” Pence wrote in his letter.\n\nHolder told CNN’s Don Lemon in an interview Thursday about the email Pence received: “I could see on the phone what it was.”\n\n“We saw the email with the Speaker’s logo on it and my, the DOP, our director of photography, also saw it as well,” Holder said. “At the time, I knew there was something that had happened, then afterwards, we then confirmed it.”\n\nCNN cannot independently confirm what was shown to Pence during the interview. The Pence letter from that evening had a Vice Presidential seal at the top. \n\nIn the clip, after looking at the email, Pence tells his aide, “Yeah, excellent,” as he is handed the phone with the email. He then offers a pained smirk and asks the aide to “tell Zach to print me off a hard copy for the trip home.” Pence then collects himself for the rest of the interview.\n\nThe next clip shows Pence saying, “I am always hopeful about America,” juxtaposed against the backdrop of crews erecting security fencing around the Capitol building.\n\nThe footage of Pence’s interview, which has not been previously released, was captured less than a week after pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win. Pence had to be evacuated to safety amid calls from rioters to “hang Mike Pence.”\n\nThe same evening that Pence was interviewed, the House passed the resolution calling for Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power and deem him unfit for office. Only one Republican, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, voted in favor of the resolution, which was effectively a symbolic vote taken one day before the House impeached Trump for a second time on January 13, 2021.\n\nIn the short clip of the documentary set to be released by Discovery Plus, which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Pence does not comment on the substance of the resolution. But the video is a small sample of the additional content now in the possession of the committee. However, the documentary states that during his interview, the former vice president declined to discuss anything related to January 6.\n\nHolder, the filmmaker, appeared Thursday behind closed doors for a deposition with the January 6 committee, which likely asked him about what he observed over the course of nearly six months when he had behind-the-scenes access to key Trump figures and even the former President himself.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump talks about January 6 attack in never-before-seen footage 03:23 • Source: CNN Trump talks about January 6 attack in never-before-seen footage 03:23\n\nIn one clip from an interview with Trump on March 2021 at Mar-a-Lago, the former President is asked directly about what happened on January 6.\n\n“Well, it was a sad day, but it was a day where there was great anger in our country, and people went to Washington primarily because they were angry with an election they think was rigged,” Trump said.\n\n“A very small portion, as you know, went down to the Capitol, and then a very small portion of them went in,” Trump continued. “But I will tell you they were angry from the standpoint of what happened in the election, because they’re smart, and they see, and they saw what happened. And I believe that was a big part of what happened on January 6.”\n\nHolder’s “Unprecedented” three-part docuseries about the 2020 election will be released on Discovery Plus later this summer. The documentary includes never-before-seen footage of the Trump family on the campaign trail and their reactions to the outcome of the election.\n\nTrump and his allies have yet to react publicly to news that Holder was subpoenaed by the committee or to the revelation of what was said in the interviews now in the panel’s possession.\n\nThe documentary includes interviews with Trump as well as three of his children: Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric, according to the clips released by Discovery Plus and obtained by CNN.\n\nLike Trump, his family members speak directly to camera in the footage. The interviews could provide new insight into what those closest to the former President were saying in the lead-up to and after January 6.\n\nIn one short clip obtained by CNN from December 2020, Ivanka Trump told the filmmaker, “As the President has said, every single vote needs to be counted, and needs to be heard. He campaigned for the voiceless.”\n\nThe clip seems to be from the same interview excerpt, first reported by The New York Times Tuesday night and confirmed by CNN, where Ivanka Trump said her father should “continue to fight until every legal remedy is exhausted” because people were questioning “the sanctity of our elections.”\n\nThe interview came days after then-attorney General William Barr publicly stated there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Under oath, Ivanka Trump told the January 6 committee that Barr’s assessment “affected my perspective” and she “accepted what he was saying.”\n\nThose comments appear to contradict the sentiment she expressed in the documentary interview.\n\nThe documentary also features Pence talking in detail about the process of Trump selecting him as his running mate. He talks about Trump inviting his family to his estate in Bedminster, New Jersey and playing golf with the then-GOP nominee as part of his vetting process.\n\nThe documentary then notes how Trump attacked Pence on January 6 as rioters called for his hanging, before turning to an interview clip from Trump.\n\n“I think I treat people well, unless they don’t treat me well, in which case you go to war,” Trump says.\n\nUPDATE: This story and headline have been updated to reflect that a spokesman for former Vice President Mike Pence disputed the contents of the email that Pence reacted to in the documentary footage.

I was sceptical before the recent congressional sessions, said Max Boot in The Washington Post. “What more is there to be said, I wondered?”\n\nThe evidence of Donald Trump’s guilt in inciting an insurrection was so glaring that it was hard to see what a select committee could add. It’s not like Watergate, “where the scandal happened behind closed doors. The entire nation saw Trump’s incendiary remarks and tweets, and the riot that followed, on national television.” But these hearings have proved more than justified. They’ve been forensic and gripping. There has been no “grandstanding”, no petty point-scoring; just facts, explanations and “the relentless march of evidence”.\n\nWe heard how Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr, called him “detached from reality”, said Quinta Jurecic in The Atlantic. We heard how family members and advisers pleaded with him to call off the mob, insisting there was no evidence of electoral fraud. We saw fresh footage of rioters attacking police and chanting “Hang Mike Pence” – a fate Trump reportedly said his vice-president deserved. In live testimony, a Capitol police officer described “slipping in people’s blood” amid “hours of hand-to-hand combat” that left her and more than 140 officers injured. Some 20 million people tuned in for the first hearings, which were crafted with the help of a former president of ABC News into what The New York Times described as something akin to “a documentary or a must-watch mini-series”.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber.

But the Democrats are “delusional if they think hysterically dramatising the events of that sad day will help them in the midterms or move the dial one iota on public perception of the Biden administration’s failures”. The clear aim of these hearings is to make sure that Trump is never elected again, said Marc A. Thiessen in The Washington Post, but they may have the reverse effect. Voters have more pressing concerns right now. Many will be asking: “Why are these people rehashing 6 Jan when I have to choose between filling my gas tank and feeding my family?”\n\nThe hearings are unlikely to rescue the Democrats from a midterm drubbing, agreed Jonah Goldberg in the Los Angeles Times. They’ve benefitted US democracy, though, by creating “a safe space” for some Republicans to acknowledge what actually happened, and distance themselves from Trump’s stolen-election lie. Another useful function of these hearings, said Neal K. Katyal in The New York Times, has been to lay the foundation for a future criminal case against Trump. Attorney General Merrick Garland surely has to bring charges now. The committee has laid out strong evidence that Trump committed “serious federal crimes”, including attempted obstruction of an official proceeding – in this case the 6 January vote certification. Trump could also be charged with wire fraud, for duping his own supporters into donating $250m to an “official election defence fund” to overturn the election, which never existed; the money was just lumped in with the rest of Trump’s war chest.\n\nGarland faces “an excruciatingly difficult decision”, said Ken Dilanian on NBC News. Filing charges against Trump could cause civil unrest, added Barbara McQuade, an NBC legal analyst and a former US attorney. No former president has ever been indicted, let alone by an opposing administration. But failing to hold him accountable for his attempt to subvert democracy could be “even worse”.", "authors": ["The Week"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}]}
