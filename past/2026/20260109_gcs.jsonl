It comes after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, both Democrats, criticized President Trump's plan to send the National Guard into Chicago, as Trump did earlier this month in Washington, DC.\n\nThe Chicago operation could involve as many as 200 Department of Homeland Security officials, armored vehicles, and the use of a naval base outside the city as a staging area, the outlets reported. Chicago's violent crime is reportedly down 22%, compared to the same period a year ago. The statistic parallels a Council on Criminal Justice report in July showing that most crime categories have also dropped in other cities across America.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond directly to USA TODAY's request for comment on a planned Chicago operation. Both emailed a statement generally supporting Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\n\"President Trump has been clear: we are going to make our streets and cities safe again,\" the statement read. \"Under (Homeland Security) Secretary Noem, ICE and CBP are working overtime to deliver on the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.\"\n\nChicago prepping for possible National Guard deployment\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago city leaders are preparing for the possible arrival of National Guard troops as they briefed the City Council on what the city's response will be, according to WLS-TV.\n\nPolice Superintendent Larry Snelling was asked during an audio-only briefing with reporters on Aug. 28 how police would interact with the troops.\n\n\"It's impossible to answer that question without knowing if they're going to be here, what their orders are, what purpose they intend to serve,\" Snelling said. \"But the key here is to communicate, to have some type of communication, so that nothing gets out of hand, nothing gets out of control, and we maintain peace in our city.\"\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson added during the briefing, \"We have not had any communication with the White House regarding the president's alleged, alleged, his purported desire to send federal troops into cities across America; he has not communicated that with us.\"\n\nJohnson, according to WMAQ-TV, also said, \"The National Guard, they do not have arresting authority or policing powers. They don't have that. Now, if there are federal agents that are arresting people -- the FBI, ATF -- those types of arrests happen throughout our country.\"\n\nIs Trump sending troops to Chicago?: What we know about National Guard deployment\n\nSnelling told reporters that Chicago police officers will all be in uniform if there is any federal deployment to the city to ensure residents know who they are. If there is any immigration enforcement, a police supervisor would be dispatched to assess the situation, Snelling said.\n\n\"When federal agents come in to do work and whatever they decide to do when it comes to arrest things of that nature, the Chicago Police Department does not, cannot, and will not interfere with the work that federal agents are doing,\" Snelling said.\n\nBut the chief said they \"don't want to raise any fears.\"\n\n\"We don't want to create any speculation around what's going on until we have concrete information. We don't put anything out there,\" Snelling said. \"As information trickles in, we prepare around that information. But right now, the communication is limited.\"\n\nHowever, one city leader, 15th Ward Alderman Raymond Lopez, posted on social media criticizing the mayor and police chief on Aug. 28 after two teens were shot on the city's South Side.\n\n\"If having national guardsmen on hand to increase uniform presence keeps our youth from getting shot, what's the damn problem?\" Lopez said.\n\nTrump doesn't tip his hand on when troops would come to Chicago\n\nTrump has repeatedly talked about sending the National Guard to Chicago to help deal with its crime, similar to Washington, DC, but he has given no timeline. However, in a Truth Social post on Aug. 28, the president criticized Pritzker and indicated Chicago could be next.\n\n\"Governor Pritzker had 6 murders in Chicago this weekend. 20 people were shot. But he doesn’t want to ask me for help. Can this be possible?\" Trump wrote. \"The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing.

In Portland, Oregon, masked officers clashed with protesters wearing inflatable animal costumes. In the nation's capital, police set up checkpoints and troops patrolled the streets.\n\nSince early June, President Donald Trump has surged federal resources into a growing number of Democratic-led cities as part of a widening crackdown on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nThe deployments have sparked intense backlash, a dizzying number of legal battles and upended daily life in communities flooded with federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nThe Trump administration says the added resources are needed to service the president’s mass deportation campaign and clamp down on violence in liberal cities. Critics, including state and local officials, say the deployments are an illegal show of force and a power grab.\n\nAcross the country, federal operations have taken different forms, shaped by levels of cooperation between federal and local officials, protests over heightened immigration enforcement and the scale of the operations themselves.\n\nIn several cities, immigration raids touched off a wave of demonstrations, prompting Trump to call up National Guard troops. In others, federal agents worked closely with local police to target crime more broadly, setting up roving patrols and checkpoints. One major commonality: The cities all experienced a surge in immigration enforcement.\n\nReporters across the USA TODAY Network spoke with experts, residents, officials and local advocates to capture the impact of federal intervention in U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland and Chicago – a short list that seems likely to grow as the president eyes deployments to other cities.\n\nMany residents and local officials said the cities didn't need intervention, especially a deployment of troops. Some living in crime-stricken areas said while they generally support the idea of more law enforcement in their communities, they want the operations to target violent crimes – not immigration violations.\n\nExperts, meanwhile, said targeted police work is the most effective way to lower crime and worry that the federal government's flood-the-zone tactics, both in immigration enforcement and general crimefighting, could erode public trust in police.\n\n“Aggressive enforcement needs to be reserved for the most aggressive criminals,” said Thomas Abt, director of the Center for the Study and Practice of Violence Reduction. He added that broad, heavy-handed policing has “limited benefits and a lot of collateral consequences.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson hailed the president's efforts and said local leaders across the country should take inspiration and \"clean up their city.\"\n\n\"Making America Safe Again – especially crime-ridden cities – was a key campaign promise from the President that the American people elected him to fulfill,\" Jackson said in a statement.\n\nChicago: Intensifying ICE raids and widespread protests\n\nThe nation’s third-largest city has become the latest flashpoint in the battle between local officials and the Trump administration over the president's deportation campaign and federal deployments.\n\nIn September, Trump launched Operation Midway Blitz, an initiative he said was needed to catch \"the worst of the worst\" criminal immigrants. Research has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.\n\nExpanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids triggered protests in downtown Chicago and the city's surrounding suburbs. As tensions boiled, clashes broke out and federal agents used pepper balls and tear gas, hitting journalists, a pastor and officers with the Chicago Police Department, according to reports and a lawsuit.\n\nThe president called for the arrests of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for “failing to protect” ICE agents.\n\nResidents and local advocates have accused ICE of employing reckless and brutal tactics during the blitz. Some incidents that have raised alarm: Immigration agents fatally shot a Mexican immigrant accused of resisting arrest; a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a U.S. citizen on the city’s South Side; and, reportedly, a school had to hold recess indoors after federal authorities deployed a chemical agent nearby.\n\nThe most controversial raid came on Sept. 30, when federal agents descended from Black Hawk helicopters and ransacked a South Side apartment building in an aggressive search of apartments inhabited by Venezuelan migrants.\n\nTwo of 37 people arrested were “confirmed” gang members, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Dozens of U.S. citizens were pulled from their beds and temporarily zip-tied during the operation, which Pritzker wants investigated by state agencies.\n\nDHS officials say aggressive tactics are necessary to catch criminals, and accused protesters of attacking agents and \"rioting.\" Over 1,500 immigrants have been arrested in connection with the blitz, the agency said. USA TODAY has not been able to verify the number of detentions or the criminal background of those in custody.\n\nChicagoans said the federal intervention has made their neighborhoods virtually unrecognizable.\n\n\"We went from being this community that walks our kids to school or goes out to parks. Now the streets are empty,\" said Corina Pedraza, a longtime South Sider.\n\nLocal alderwoman Julia Ramirez told USA TODAY that people \"can't live their lives the way they did before.\"\n\n\"Agents have created a war zone in our community,\" she said.\n\nPortland, Oregon: Tensions flare at ICE facility\n\n“War ravaged,” “burning to the ground” and “hell” are words Trump has used to describe the liberal stronghold of Portland in recent weeks – characterizations vehemently disputed by local residents and officials.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as the president seeks to deploy troops to the city over the objections of local and state officials. A federal judge in Oregon initially blocked the deployments, but an appeals court on Oct. 20 ruled in Trump’s favor, lifting one of the orders preventing the president from calling up 200 Oregon guardsmen to Portland.\n\nTrump officials say soldiers are necessary to protect federal personnel and an ICE facility in South Portland, where demonstrators have protested on a nightly basis.\n\nOutside the facility earlier this month, USA TODAY reporters saw demonstrators peacefully protesting. There were people in puffy animal costumes dancing on the sidewalk and waving signs as motorists drove by, honking in support. Other forms of resistance have had a distinctly Portland vibe, such as an “emergency” naked bike ride in mid-October.\n\nCity residents said Trump’s characterization of Portland as a city “under siege” is false and misleading.\n\n“It offends me so deeply that we have a president that is willing and able to spread such misinformation without hitting the streets and coming out here,” said Tiana Stewart, 37, a bartender. “But he knows that the people who are watching are going to buy into it. It’s ludicrous to me.”\n\nPortland is not without its problems. Homeless camps are visible in parts of the city and drug use, especially the surge of fentanyl, is a serious concern that prompted officials to declare a 90-day state of emergency last year. But residents said they don’t think the president’s crackdown is meant to address those issues.\n\n“Obviously, this is all a scam,” said Curtis Best, 70, a retired molecular biologist. “I really believe it’s a way to militarize police and make problems in these cities … I think he just wants revenge on us. I think he just doesn't like Democrat cities, Democrat states, or its people.”\n\nMemphis: A crime-stricken city flooded with feds. Is it helping?\n\nUnlike other cities where Trump deployed National Guard troops, Memphis sits in a state led by a Republican governor who has welcomed the president’s wishes to mobilize military forces.\n\nIn September, Trump created a crime-fighting task force involving over a dozen federal agencies and the state's National Guard – a move he said was requested by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.\n\nA week after troops were seen patrolling downtown Memphis on Oct. 10, a group of Democratic officials filed a lawsuit against Lee, claiming the deployment violated the state constitution. A judge has since denied the plaintiffs’ request to pause the deployment.\n\nIn 2024, Memphis had the highest rate of murder and other violent crimes of any large American city, according to a USA TODAY analysis of FBI data from 30 cities with more than 500,000 residents.\n\nMemphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he's working to steer the task force to focus on violent offenders, rather than immigration enforcement.\n\n\"The busier we can keep them with (the Memphis Police Department), the less time they will have to focus on immigration,\" he said at a town hall on Oct. 20.\n\nOfficials have given conflicting portrayals of the task force's work so far.\n\nThe White House says the task force has yielded 1,300 arrests related to outstanding warrants, drugs and firearms. But a county mayor and local advocates say a large portion of the arrests were for immigration offenses, not violent crime.\n\nMauricio Calvo, president and CEO of advocacy organization Latino Memphis, said some people have shut themselves in their homes because of the heightened immigration enforcement and concerns over racial profiling.\n\n“People don’t want to send the kids to school, people don’t want to work,” he said. “We’re in crisis mode.\"\n\nWashington, DC: Mixed feelings on Trump's crime crackdown\n\nTrump declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital on Aug. 11, using its status as a federal district to take control of the city’s police department and send in thousands of federal agents and National Guard troops.\n\nFor weeks, federal agents and local police set up checkpoints across the city, spurring protests. Immigration raids expanded, instilling fear as officers arrested workers and delivery drivers. Several of the city’s small homeless campsites were broken down, leading some of the homeless to enter shelters temporarily.\n\nMeanwhile, National Guard troops patrolled monuments and Metro stations, some with assault rifles. They removed graffiti, picked up trash and shoveled mulch. An internal budget viewed by USA TODAY estimated the guard deployment could cost taxpayers more than $200 million.\n\nAfter 30 days, the federal takeover of the police department ended and Trump declared the operation a success, touting a drop in reported crimes and anecdotes of people “going out to dinner where they didn’t go out for years.”\n\nThe data, though, was murky. While local police data shows a short-term dip in some reported crimes after the crackdown began – especially incidents involving firearms – crime had already been trending downward in recent years. Experts who viewed the data said it’s too soon to know if the crackdown had any significant or long-term impact on violent crime.\n\nAcross the city, residents were conflicted about the federal operation.\n\nFor 20 years, Charles Wilson has lived in Anacostia, a neighborhood with one of the highest rates of murder and violent crime in Washington. He said while he has not seen a surge of federal agents in his neighborhood, he’s noticed fewer people loitering and he doesn’t hear as many “random gunshots.”\n\n“There’s definitely been a shift, and things feel a little calmer and a little safer,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nBut Wilson also said the assertive immigration enforcement in Washington, some of which has gone viral online, \"doesn't sit well\" with him or his neighbors.\n\n\"It seems un-American and mean-spirited,\" he said.\n\nLos Angeles: Raids, protests, state of emergency\n\nLos Angeles has remained one of the central targets of Trump’s sweeping illegal immigration campaign and was the first American city where he deployed National Guard troops in his second term in office.\n\nFollowing ICE raids at a Home Depot and a clothing manufacturer in June, thousands of people took to the streets to protest. While demonstrations were contained to a few downtown blocks, they erupted into violence, with clashes breaking out between protesters and police, and reports of looting and property damage.\n\nTrump ordered 4,000 California National Guard troops and at least 500 Marines to protect federal personnel and property in the city. The move was challenged in court, and a California judge said the deployment was illegal but did not order the remaining soldiers to leave. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in September that the deployment had already cost taxpayers nearly $120 million.\n\nICE agents kept up their high pace of arrests, and in October, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency. Local officials said the federal agency \"created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy.\"\n\nOngoing immigration raids and operations across Los Angeles County – which is home to over 3 million people born outside the United States – have led to a decline in workplace attendance and strained critical services such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship, according to the board of supervisors.\n\nLupe Lopez, 69, whose family owns nine Arteagas Food Center supermarkets, told USA TODAY she’s seen a big drop in foot traffic at her family’s shop in the Hispanic neighborhood of East San Jose. The reason: Young people are buying in bulk because their parents are afraid of being outside, where they might be picked up by immigration agents.\n\n\"A lot more people are either staying closer to home or not coming out at all,” she said.\n\nChristopher Cann, Michael Loria, Suzette Hackney and Terry Collins report for USA TODAY.

What to ...", "text": "Updated Jan. 29, 2025, 3:08 p.m. ET\n\n(This article was updated to include new information.)\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration has taken center stage in the first days of his second term, from his sweeping order on birthright citizenship to the growing number of raids across the country.\n\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is even publicizing its daily total of arrests, which added up to 3,104 in the past three days alone and more than 4,500 since Thursday.\n\nStricter enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws isn't a new development. President Joe Biden’s administration deported more than 271,000 people last year, the largest number since 2014, according to an ICE report.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said his administration will prioritize deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal histories. In recent days, some local officials have emphasized that focus.\n\nAustin Police Chief Lisa Davis said “at the end of the day, these are people APD would be looking for as well. They were wanted for violent offenses.”\n\nStill, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked at a news briefing how many of those arrested by ICE since Trump returned to power actually have criminal records.\n\n“All of them, because they illegally broke our nation’s laws and therefore they are criminals as far as this administration goes,’’ Leavitt said.\n\nHere's the USA TODAY Network's look at states that have seen major immigration actions in recent days.\n\nTexas\n\nThe state sharing the largest border with Mexico figured to be the site of multiple raids, and those were carried out last weekend in cities like Houston, San Antonio, Austin and Laredo, among others, according to the Austin American-Statesman. The newspaper pointed out other federal agencies besides ICE were also involved, including the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nNo arrest totals were immediately available, but Texas Public Radio reported 84 ICE arrests in the Dallas metropolitan area.\n\nDavis, Austin's police chief, said while her department was not involved in the operations, federal officials told her they focused on “wanted violent offenders.’’ Jorge Vela, a defense lawyer in the city who has represented clients accused of committing violent crimes while in the U.S. illegally, said that’s common practice.\n\n“This is nothing new so far from what I have seen,’’ Vela told the American-Statesman. “It’s just that more resources are being devoted to that, and this feels like an initial show of force.’’\n\nStart your day informed: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing newsletter.\n\nColorado\n\nAgents from a handful of federal agencies combined to arrest more than 40 people in the country illegally early Sunday during a raid in Adams County, the local office of the Drug Enforcement Administration said.\n\nThe office shared on social media the operation targeted “drug trafficking & members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA). Drugs, weapons, and cash were seized in Adams County. Nearly 50 illegal aliens were taken into custody.’’\n\nKDVR-TV reported the investigation that led to the raid began under the Biden administration. Several media reports indicate federal authorities are zeroing on nearby Aurora, which Trump claimed was overrun by Venezuelan gangs during the presidential campaign.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago officials said on Tuesday at least 100 people have been detained as immigration-related operations ramped up across the country.\n\n\"We don't have an exact number of Chicago people who have been detained, but what I can tell you is that the number in the Chicagoland area exceeds 100,\" said Chicago Police Department Superintendent Larry Snelling at a news conference Tuesday, adding that arrests have occurred in the city as well as surrounding suburbs.\n\nSnelling – who reiterated that Chicago officers will not assist federal immigration officers – did not describe the operations in detail but said he received notification before the detentions took place. He indicated the arrests appear to be targeted, saying \"We have not seen federal agents running through Chicago, looking for children, going to work locations and grabbing people.\"\n\nAt least one of the raids was attended by \"border czar\" Tom Homan and television personality Dr. Phil, who documented an arrest on a live stream.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson criticized what he called the Trump administration's \"desire to popularize fear\" and said \"We will continue to protect civil and human rights, and we welcome all individuals and families who want to work, live and thrive here in our beloved city.\"\n\nFlorida\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Investigations in Tallahassee, in collaboration with the Florida Highway Patrol, detained 12 suspected undocumented immigrants Tuesday in Jefferson County, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.\n\nThe FHP posted photos of the operation, saying, “We are ready and willing to follow the governor’s lead and work with federal partners to execute the Trump illegal immigration mandate!’’\n\nOn Sunday, the ICE office in Miami said it had separately arrested a Nicaraguan resident and a Jamaican resident on multiple charges.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nIn Newark, ICE agents raiding a local business without a warrant Thursday detained not only undocumented immigrants but American citizens as well, Mayor Ras Baraka said.\n\n“One of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned,” Baraka said.\n\nOfficials in New Jersey, which has nearly half a million undocumented residents and about 2 million immigrants in all, frequently clashed with Trump’s administration during his first term. Some appear ready for another round.\n\nBaraka said Newark won’t “stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,” the Star-Ledger reported.\n\nNew York\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joined immigration officers as they arrested several people in New York City this week, posting several videos and photos of the operations on social media.\n\n\"Arresting some criminal aliens this morning in NYC – thank you to the brave officers involved,\" Noem said in several posts on X. \"Criminal alien with kidnapping, assault & burglary charges is now in custody – thanks to ICE. Dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets.\"\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said the city worked with the Department of Homeland Security to nab Anderson Zambrano-Pacheco, 26, who officials say has alleged ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Adams said he was \"hiding\" in New York City and was connected with \"multiple violent crimes,\" including burglary, kidnapping, extortion, firearms possession and menacing with a firearm among other charges.\n\nOfficials also said Zambrano-Pacheco was one of several men, including members of Tren de Aragua, who was shown in security footage at an Aurora apartment complex that gained national attention last year.\n\n\"As I have repeatedly said, we will not hesitate to partner with federal authorities to bring violent criminals to justice – just as we have done for years,\" Adams said in a post on X.\n\nIn Westchester County on Tuesday, the Sleepy Hallow Police Department received a notice from ICE that immigration officers would in the area to serve a warrant for \"two specific individuals,\" reported the Journal News/lohud.\n\n\"The agent did not state or imply that there would be a 'mass round-up,'\" Sleepy Hollow Police Chief Anthony Bueti said in a statement. \"Instead, they were in Sleepy Hollow for the two individuals with a criminal past.\"\n\nCalifornia\n\nFederal agencies working in California pledged cooperation in immigration enforcement operations and posted photos on social media of people being taken into custody.\n\n“The DEA, along with @TheJusticeDept, is assisting @DHSgov and other federal law enforcement partners w their immigration enforcement efforts.

Trump cited hearing from people in the farm and leisure industries concerned about worker shortages because of mass deportations.\n\n\"Our farmers are being hurt badly,\" Trump said June 12. \"You know, they have very good workers. They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be, you know, great.\"\n\nEven before Trump's latest charge to ICE, the agency had dramatically expanded its deportation operations after the White House demanded the agency increase its arrests of migrants in the country illegally, Reuters reported. Daily quotas increased from 1,000 arrests a day to 3,000.\n\nTrump's border czar, Tom Homan, said in late May that the administration had deported about 200,000 people over four months ‒ a total that lags behind the deportations during a similar period under former President Joe Biden. The White House has said the discrepancy is the result of fewer migrants coming to the border.\n\nMigrants seeking to cross the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped significantly during Trump's first five months of his second term. Border Patrol agents have seen their monthly encounters of migrants and asylum seekers drop to fewer than 10,000, down from more than 100,000 one year ago.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your identity: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2025/11/20/pope-leo-xiv-gov-jb-pritzker-discuss-immigration-crackdown/87363850007/", "title": "Pope Leo XIV, Gov.

Gov. Juliana Stratton, a Democrat, wrote on social media after the news broke on Aug. 28. “Trump's plan to attack Chicago has nothing to do with immigration. This con of his has nothing to do with safety.”\n\nGov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, both Democrats, have also criticized Trump’s plans, as the president attacks their handling of crime in Chicago and promotes a heavier-handed approach.\n\nTrump said Chicago is next after DC National Guard deployment\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan told reporters earlier in the day that there had been discussions about using a naval base just north of Chicago as an operations center for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but he noted it was still in the planning phase.\n\n“We’re not going to tell you how many resources we’re going to send to the city,” Homan said of the operation. “We don’t want the bad guys to know what we’re sending. It would be a large contingent.”\n\nTrump identified Chicago on Aug. 22 as the “next one” to have the National Guard mobilized after Washington, DC. That city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, said Aug. 27 that the increased federal presence in her city was “almost exclusively focused on immigration enforcement and homeless encampment enforcement.”\n\nA political action committee affiliated with Trump sent out a fundraising email from Trump on Aug. 28 asking whether he should activate the National Guard nationwide to protect American cities. “Our great American cities are FALLING APART,” the email said. “Many are afraid to go outside at night!”\n\nAmong American cities with more than 500,000 people, Chicago has one of the lowest violent crime rates, according to a USA TODAY analysis of FBI data, ranking 29th out of 37 in 2024. But it has the 10th highest murder rate, ahead of cities such as Houston, Nashville and Philadelphia.\n\n“I urge our federal government to listen to the advocates, experts, and Chicagoans who are calling for resources that stop the endless flow of guns in our city as well as transformational investments in housing, education, mental health, and community safety,” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 27 news release.\n\nJohnson said those “proven strategies” are leading to “historic reductions in crime and violence.” Statistics from his office show a 49% decrease from Aug. 25, 2024, to Aug. 25, 2025, in carjackings, a 45% decrease in mass shootings, a 37% decrease in overall shootings and a 32% decrease in murders.\n\nHe said in a statement Aug. 29 that reports of escalated immigration enforcement were \"deeply concerning.\" He said his administration would work to make sure Chicago residents know their rights and said he was launching \"a Family Preparedness campaign so that families know what to do to prepare in the event of a detention by federal agents.\"\n\n‘We feel disrespected’\n\n“Governor Pritzker had 6 murders in Chicago this weekend,” Trump wrote on social media Aug. 28, “20 people were shot. But he doesn’t want to ask me for help. Can this be possible? The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing. STAY TUNED!!!”\n\nThe previous day, Trump wrote: “Panic stricken Governor Pritzker says that crime is under control, when in fact it is just the opposite. He is an incompetent Governor who should call me for HELP. Mayor Johnson is no better. Make Chicago Great Again!”\n\nMarlon Chamberlain, executive director of the Illinois Coalition to End Permanent Punishment, told USA TODAY: “We feel disrespected when we hear someone in the highest office in the country talk about the place where we live without having direct conversations with folks that are on the ground.\"\n\n“This is not about public safety,” Chamberlain said. “I think everybody sort of knows that this is sort of political bullying that is happening.”\n\nIf the administration really wants to help Chicago fix root problems behind crime and violence, “the community is saying, ‘Here’s what we need.’ Folks that have dedicated their lives to doing this work,” he said.\n\nRichard Wallace, the Founder and Director of Equity and Transformation, a nonprofit focused on social and economic equity for Black workers, told USA TODAY he’s focused on ensuring people know their rights, have access to legal assistance and, if unhoused, that they can access financial aid.\n\n“We’re going to respond to them with love,” Wallace said. “The spirit that the National Guard is entering with, we’re going to show them a clear contrast.”\n\nContributing: USA TODAY reporters Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, Michael Loria, Trevor Hughes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/11/what-is-ice-immigration-raids-protests-iowa/84149611007/", "title": "What is ICE?

The raids and subsequent protests came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants, including at workplaces, traffic stops and routine legal check-ins.\n\nBy June 7, Trump announced that 4,000 California National Guard troops would be deployed to Los Angeles to protect ICE agents and federal buildings and contain what he described as \"violent, instigated riots,\" drawing criticism from California officials who accuse the president of stoking tension and escalating unrest.\n\nAs protests in California entered their fifth day on Tuesday, June 10, demonstrations began sprouting up in major cities around the country, including Des Moines, which was the site of a small protest at Cowles Commons.\n\nDuring the Des Moines protests, groups could be heard chanting \"Power to the people. No one is illegal,\" and \"No justice, no peace. We want ICE off our streets.\" Des Moines police were present, but the rally stayed peaceful, according to Register reporting.\n\nICE officers also conducted a raid in neighboring Omaha, Nebraska, on June 10. A legislator said 75-80 people were detained at the Glen Valley Foods plant.\n\nHere's what you need to know about ICE and the 2025 U.S. immigration protests.\n\nWhat is ICE?\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a federal law enforcement agency that enforces immigration laws in the country by removing undocumented immigrants and preventing the illegal movement of people or contraband in and out of the country.\n\nSince its founding in 2003, ICE has routinely conducted deportations in cities throughout the United States. Between Oct. 1, 2023, and Sept. 30, 2024, ICE agents deported 271,484 people to 192 countries, according to the agency's annual report. Fiscal year 2024 saw a 90% increase in deportations compared to 2023 and a 276% increase compared to 2022.\n\nIn January, the Polk County Sheriff's Office told the Register that ICE agents arrested one person at the Polk County Courthouse in Des Moines on Jan. 23. In February, ICE announced in a news release that it had arrested a suspected MS-13 gang member wanted for murder during a traffic stop in Des Moines.\n\nHow many undocumented immigrants are in Iowa?\n\nIowa is home to roughly 109,000 undocumented immigrants, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nIs ICE in Iowa?\n\nIowa has two ICE offices: one in Des Moines, located in the Neal Smith Federal Building at 210 Walnut St. and the other in Cedar Rapids.\n\nPrevious Iowa immigration raids in Postville, Mount Pleasant\n\nIowa has had a series of immigration-related raids over the past two decades.\n\nIn 2006, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers raided a Swift & Co. pork processing facility in Marshalltown, arresting 90 people.\n\nTwo years later, ICE held one of its largest immigration raids at the time in Postville, a town of 2,000 people on the northeast edge of Iowa, where agents arrested nearly 390 workers of a beef-packing plant. During his first term in office, Trump commuted the sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, an executive sentenced to 27 years on bank fraud and money laundering charges in connection with the raid.\n\nIn March 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested 23 undocumented immigrants in Iowa during a three-day operation that covered five Midwest states. Days before the 10-year-anniversary of the Postvillle raid in May 2018, 32 people were arrested at a pre-stressed concrete plant outside of Mount Pleasant, an eastern Iowa town of 8,500 people.\n\nIn March 2020, ICE arrested three Guatemalan men during a raid in Cedar Rapids.\n\nCooper Worth is a service/trending reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Hellerstein ordered Maduro held until a March 17 hearing.\n\nMaduro, 63, his wrists bound by zip-tie restraints, was ferried by helicopter from a federal jail in Brooklyn to Manhattan early Monday, Jan. 5. Flag-waving protesters both opposing and celebrating Maduro's capture rallied in the cold outside the courthouse, separated by police.\n\nIt was a long way from the presidential palace in Caracas, where Maduro was seized by U.S. Delta Force commandos early on Jan. 3.\n\nMaduro and Flores are charged in a four-count indictment linking them to a 25-year narco-terrorism conspiracy. Speaking on Air Force One, President Donald Trump described the case against Maduro as \"infallible.\" Maduro has long denied involvement in drug trafficking. He's accused of running a network that partnered with violent groups including Mexico’s Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Colombian FARC rebels and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nWho’s in charge of Venezuela now?\n\nTrump on Monday revealed that key administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance, would take charge of running U.S. involvement in Venezuela.\n\n\"It's a group of all. They have all expertise, different expertise,\" the president told NBC News in an exclusive interview. The president added he was ultimately the one in charge.\n\nThe president’s comments come after saying on Sunday that the United States would \"run\" Venezuela until a democratic transition could occur. Trump also told NBC the South American country will not have elections in the next 30 days.\n\nIt remains unclear how closely U.S. officials will become involved in running Venezuela as Maduro’s Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has assumed control of the country’ government following the raid that saw U.S. military operatives take Venezuela’s president to New York City to face charges. Trump says he remains willing to order military strikes on the country.\n\nUS companies will restore Venezuela's oil industry, White House says\n\nU.S. oil companies will take charge of rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry, the White House said Monday.\n\n\"Our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told USA TODAY. \"American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"\n\nVenezuela has among the largest crude oil reserves in the world. Their oil output, however, has declined in recent years amid aging infrastructure and political strife, according to experts.\n\nTrump, in a separate interview with NBC News, suggested the government would reimburse U.S. companies for the costs of restoring oil output in the country and that the companies could be up and running in Venezuela within 18 months.\n\n\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it’ll be a lot of money,\" Trump said Monday, according to the outlet. \"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us, or through revenue.\"\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader in exile plans to return 'as soon as possible'\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader and recent Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado said on Fox News on Monday that she \"wants to go back as soon as possible\" to her home country.\n\nMachado, 58, was speaking about what’s next following Maduro’s ouster. Her comments come after she was seen in public for the first time in about a year when she arrived in Norway to accept the Nobel Peace Prize in December.\n\nThe Venezuelan leader won the prize over Trump but dedicated the honor to the U.S. president. Machado said on Fox News that she has not spoken with the president since October.\n\nTrump has declined to back Machado if she moves to lead Venezuela. Her winning the peace prize has nothing to do with his decision, he said.\n\n\"She should not have won it,\" Trump said of Machado. \"But no, that has nothing to do with my decision.\"\n\nUS control of region is 'crystal clear,' says top GOP lawmaker\n\nA top Republican lawmaker said the U.S.’ control of the region \"should be crystal clear\" following the raid that saw military operatives capture Maduro.\n\n\"The control that the United States of America has over the Gulf,\" said Rep. Brian Mast, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, \"should be crystal clear.\"\n\nThe U.S. representative for Florida's 21st congressional district spoke outside an hours-long classified briefing on the raid at the South American nation’s capitol. He said he expected no further U.S. military action in the region.\n\n\"Unless there's a warrant that has to be enforced in some way, in the same way that had to be enforced against Nicholas Maduro, then you shouldn't expect to see anything else take place,\" Mast said.\n\nThe Florida Republican said the swearing in of Maduro’s Vice President Delcy Rodríguez would prevent a power vacuum from forming until \"free and fair\" elections can be held. Mast declined to comment on when elections might take place.\n\n“What takes place in the future has to be charted forward by the Venezuelan people,” Mast said.\n\nWill anyone get the $50 million reward for Maduro's capture?\n\nIn 2020, during Trump's first term in office, the Justice Department began offering a reward of $15 million for information leading to Maduro's arrest or conviction. The bounty was raised to $25 million during the Biden administration, and again to $50 million under Trump last July.\n\nAt a news conference after Maduro's capture on Jan. 3, Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that nobody would be paid the reward money.\n\n\"I guess we save $50 million,\" Rubio said.\n\n\"Don't let anybody claim it. Nobody deserves it but us,\" Trump replied.\n\nOnly 1 in 3 Americans approve of U.S. military’s Maduro raid: poll\n\nOne in three Americans approves of the U.S. military strike to remove Maduro from the presidency of Venezuela while 72% of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll worry about becoming too involved in the South American country.\n\nThe two-day poll showed 65% of Republicans back the military operation ordered by Republican President Donald Trump, compared with 11% of Democrats and 23% of independents.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,248 adults was conducted on Jan. 4 and 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMaduro protests can't stop love\n\nDozens of protesters were gathered outside the Daniel Patrick Moynihan federal courthouse, leading to a few heated confrontations between New Yorkers celebrating the arrest and people expressing support for Maduro. Vendors did brisk business selling Venezuelan flags, many of which could be seen among the crowd.\n\nThe courthouses of lower Manhattan sit among numerous government buildings − including the city's Marriage Bureau, which cranks out a wedding ceremony every 15 minutes or so.\n\nAs protesters screamed at each other outside Maduro's arraignment, a newly married couple set off confetti poppers on nearby court steps, ignoring the conflict nearby.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nMaduro's defense strategy? Lawyer signals capture could be key focus\n\nMaduro's lawyer, Barry Pollack, said at the proceedings that he expects a major legal battle over what he described as Maduro's \"military abduction.\" That suggests the defense's legal fight might not focus exclusively on the charges Maduro faces, but instead could challenge whether he was legally captured and legally brought into court.\n\nPollack said Maduro isn't currently asking to be released, but reserves the right to do so down the line.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi and Reuters\n\nA judge and a president meet in the courtroom\n\nWhen Judge Hellerstein first asked Maduro to identify himself, he stated his name and said: “I am the president of the Republic of Venezuela. I was captured in my home in Venezuela…”\n\nMaduro was given a copy of the indictment Monday morning and waived a formal reading of the document in court, saying he would rather read it personally than have it read to him aloud. Hellerstein then reminded Maduro of his rights to remain silent and to counsel. Maduro said, “I did not know of these rights. Your honor is informing me of them now.”\n\nThen he said, “I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am president of Venezuela.”\n\nBoth Maduro and Cilia Flores walked in shortly after the U.S. attorneys sat down. He was flanked on both sides by attorneys, all sharing the same table. While Maduro's hands were in restraints during his transfer to the courthouse, neither he nor wife were shackled in the courtroom.\n\nCilia's lawyer said she had “sustained significant injuries.” Her lawyer motioned to the judge, saying \"as you can see.\" He said she could have fractures or bruising on her ribs and asked Hellerstein to ensure both Maduro and Cilia receved medical attention. The judge approved it.\n\nFederal prosecutors requested a hearing on March 17. Defense attorney Barry Pollack said there were issues about the legality of Maduro's military seizure and his position as a foreign leader.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer\n\nNo immediate request for bail\n\nBarry Pollack, a defense lawyer for Maduro and his wife, didn’t request bail at the hearing so they could be released pending trial. But Pollack said he might ask for bail later.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMaduro says he is 'still president' of Venezuela\n\nBefore he was cut off by Judge Hellerstein, Maduro insisted he remains president of Venezuela, despite his detention and criminal charges in the United States.\n\n\"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,\" Maduro said through an interpreter.\n\nVenezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, insisted after Maduro's capture that he remained the country's leader. Rodríguez holds the title of 'acting president.\"\n\nMaduro appears in federal court\n\nMaduro made his first appearance in federal court in New York on Jan. 5 to face charges of narco-terrorism and cocaine importation conspiracy.\n\nHe is expected to enter a plea during the Manhattan appearance before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMaduro gets high-powered defense lawyer\n\nCriminal defense lawyer Barry Pollack is representing deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in his federal criminal trial in New York, court documents show.\n\nPollack negotiated a plea agreement that “resulted in the immediate release from prison of long-time client Julian Assange,” the publisher of website WikiLeaks, according to Pollack’s bio on the website of his law firm. Assange had been charged with violating the Espionage Act for publishing classified information leaked by Chelsea Manning.\n\nPollack also “obtained the complete acquittal of a former Enron Corp. executive on criminal fraud charges,” his bio said. It said that was “one of only two cases that resulted in acquittals in the numerous prosecutions arising out of the collapse of Enron.” USA TODAY has reached out to Pollack and his law firm for comment.\n\nMaduro, his wife Cilia Flores and others are charged in an allege narco-terrorist conspiracy.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS ambassador says there's 'no war against Venezuela'\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations defended the recent military action in Venezuela, calling Maduro a “illegitimate” leader and rejecting claims the move could destabilize the region.\n\nMichael Waltz, who spoke at an emergency Security Council meeting, described the mission as a “surgical law enforcement operation” and said it will not result in a prolonged occupation.\n\n“There is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying its country,” he said. “This was a law enforcement operation in furtherance of lawful indictments.”\n\nWaltz’s comments come after Trump said the U.S. was “in charge” of Venezuela and threatened a “second strike” if the government does not cooperate.\n\n– Chris Cann\n\nAre cameras in the courtroom for Maduro's charges?\n\nMaduro's arraignment won't be televised because the federal trial court for the Southern District of New York doesn't permit cameras to stream proceedings outside the courthouse walls. U.S. federal courts don't allow photography, video or audio recording in the courtrooms.\n\nReporters and members of the public must observe the proceedings in the courtroom itself or potentially in an overflow room within the courthouse that will show a livestream of what's happening in the main courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Cilia Flores?\n\nFlores is a Venezuelan lawyer and politician. Since 2015, she has served as a deputy in the National Assembly of Venezuela, of which she was president from 2006 to 2011, for her home state of Cojedes. She also previously served as Venezuela's attorney general from 2012 to 2013.\n\nDuring her legal career, Flores gained a reputation as a tough attorney, particularly after she led the defense team of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and helped secure his release from prison in 1994, following an unsuccessful coup in 1992, according to Reuters.\n\nFlores became Venezuela's first lady when Maduro won the 2013 presidential election over Henrique Capriles.\n\n\"She has a fiery character.

The Brooklyn jail was once home to Jeffrey Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell and embattled music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who is serving a prison sentence at Fort Dix in New Jersey.\n\nLuigi Mangione, accused in the fatal December 2024 shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is currently housed at the MDC awaiting trial.

Shkreli had his bail revoked and was sent to the Brooklyn facility after he allegedly made a threat to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, face a four-count indictment alleging they were at the center of a 25-year international narco-terrorism conspiracy.\n\n– Jay Stahl\n\nBolton says ousting Maduro regime will be tougher than capturing leader\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, said capturing Maduro was important, but ousting his entire regime will be more difficult.\n\nBolton, who has become a frequent Trump critic since serving in his first administration, said Venezuela’s alleged drug-smuggling regime has been in place for decades, since Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez. U.S. rivals such as Russia, China and Iran are Venezuela’s allies and wouldn’t walk away easily, Bolton said.\n\n“Let’s be clear, there’s a big difference between getting Maduro and removing the regime,” Bolton told News Nation. “It would be a hollow victory indeed if we snatched Maduro but left his regime in place.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMaduro jury trial might not start until 2027: former prosecutor\n\nAfter Maduro is arraigned on charges of narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiration and weapons counts, his defense lawyers could raise complex legal issues before reaching what Trump acknowledged could be a “slog” of a trial.\n\nMaduro’s lawyers are expected to challenge the court’s jurisdiction over his case by arguing the military attack on Venezuela violated international law, according to Jimmy Gurulé, a former prosecutor who is now a law professor at Notre Dame.\n\nThe lawyers could also argue that he deserved immunity as a head of state, Gurulé said. The defense is also expected to make a broad request for evidence in the case, which could include classified information that the U.S. government could refuse to disclose.\n\n\"While justice will ultimately be served in the Maduro case, it won't be anytime soon,” Gurulé said of a trial that might not start until 2027. “The list of pretrial issues goes on and on.

The U.S. has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish Kingdom.\"\n\nHis comments came after Trump told The Atlantic, \"We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense.\"\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nVenezuela's VP Delcy Rodríguez adopts softer tone\n\nWhile speaking to reporters on Sunday night, Trump reiterated that the U.S. is \"in charge\" of Venezuela. The president added that his administration is \"dealing with the people that just got sworn in,\" in an apparent reference to Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, who has been named as acting president.\n\nTrump told reporters that he has not spoken to Rodríguez yet, but others have, adding that he will speak to her \"at the right time.\" He later said the U.S. did not give anything to Rodríguez in exchange for cooperating but noted “she’s cooperating.”\n\nRodríguez previously rejected Trump’s claims that she was willing to work with his administration, but adopted a softer tone in a statement on Sunday night. She called for a \"balanced and respectful\" relationship with the United States, adding that relations between the two countries should be based on \"sovereign equality and non-interference.\"\n\n\"We invite the U.S. government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\" Rodríguez said in a statement on Telegram.\n\nEarlier that day, Trump had issued a warning against Rodríguez. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic.\n\nTrump wants 'total access' to Venezuela's resources\n\nWhen asked if he would demand free and fair elections in Venezuela, Trump said, \"it depends.” Before elections can take place in the country, he said Venezuela needs to be \"fixed.\"\n\n\"We're looking more at getting it fixed, getting it ready first, because it's a mess. The country is a mess,\" he said.\n\nTrump also called on Rodríguez to provide the United States with \"total access\" to Venezuela's resources. He noted that oil companies wanted to enter Venezuela and repair the country’s oil infrastructure.\n\nVenezuela is recognized as having the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Trump has said U.S. oil companies could start investing again in the region, a practice halted when Maduro's predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies.\n\nTrump threatens Colombia, says Cuba may fall on its own\n\nIn his comments on board Air Force One, Trump called Venezuela \"very sick\" and said the U.S. might launch a second military strike on the country if remaining members of Maduro's administration do not cooperate with his efforts to get the country \"fixed.\"\n\nHis comments also raised the possibility of further U.S. military interventions in Latin America. Trump suggested that Colombia and Mexico could also face military action if they do not reduce the flow of illicit drugs to the U.S.\n\n\"Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, in an apparent reference to Colombia's president Gustavo Petro.\n\nHe also said that Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela, \"looks like it's ready to fall\" on its own without U.S. military action. According to Trump, \"a lot of Cubans were killed\" during the operation to capture Maduro on Saturday.\n\nVenezuela’s Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said on state television the U.S. attack killed soldiers, civilians and a \"large part\" of Maduro's security detail \"in cold blood.\" The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens were killed during the raid.\n\nVenezuelan houses destroyed in US attack\n\nSome homes in the town of Catia La Mar near Venezuela’s capital Caracas were damaged or destroyed in the U.S. military operation, residents told Reuters on Jan. 4.\n\nJonatan Mallora, a 50-year-old motorcycle taxi driver, and his neighbor Angel Alvarez, a young street vendor, said they woke on Jan. 3 to explosions in their community in La Guaira state, about 19 miles north of Caracas.\n\n“It's sheer luck they didn't kill my kids,” Mallora said amid the rubble of his apartment, where the roof was destroyed. He said he fled and escaped unharmed along with his 24-year-old daughter and 22-year-old son.\n\n“I would never wish on anyone\" the experience of an attack, he added. “We’re alive by a miracle.”\n\nVenezuelan authorities have said the U.S. hit areas in La Guaira, Caracas and the neighboring states of Miranda and Aragua and that soldiers, civilians and much of Maduro's security team were killed, though they have not offered specific figures on dead and injured.\n\n− Reuters\n\nWhat's next in Venezuela?\n\nThe Trump administration’s capture of Maduro bore some familiar echoes to the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama that ousted military strongman Manuel Noriega, marking the most direct U.S. intervention in Latin America since.\n\nBut experts say that despite some similarities, the two key moments in America’s long and checkered history of interventions differ in major ways that could make achieving U.S. goals more challenging this time, following a raid that has revived regional anxiety.\n\n“This is not going to be so simple in Venezuela,” said Will Freeman, a Latin America fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “One, it's not even likely that we get to democracy. And two, many of the problems that were there with Maduro are going to remain.” Read more here.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nRubio, who dreamed of ousting Venezuela's Maduro, takes charge\n\nThe capture of Maduro and his wife during a nighttime raid by U.S. troops on his compound in Caracas marked the realization of a longtime political goal for Trump. But it was a personal victory for a key member of Trump’s administration: Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n“Nicolás Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this,” Rubio said, standing alongside Trump at a post-raid news conference at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “He was provided multiple, very, very, very generous offers, and chose instead to act like a wild man, chose to play around. And the result is what we saw tonight.”\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, has been one of the primary architects of the Trump administration’s Venezuela policy, which shifted the United States away from decades-long diplomatic negotiations on human rights and other issues to the use of military force to remove a de facto leader from office.

It's a good thing, too.\n\nFor more than a dozen years, Venezuelans have been oppressed by Maduro's dictatorship, which was marked by an economic crisis, human rights abuses and the active undermining of democracy.\n\nPer a federal court indictment, Maduro faces narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine-importation conspiracy and weapons charges.\n\nI am cheering along with Venezuelans both abroad and here in the United States. Democrats should be, too, though many are not, despite acknowledging Maduro's evil regime for years and even criticizing President Donald Trump for not removing Maduro. It's yet another example of Democrats' hypocrisy: They seem to hate Trump more than they want an oppressed country to be liberated. That's pretty remarkable.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n'Operation Absolute Resolve' is another military success\n\nPresident Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and hundreds of U.S. military members carried out one of the most calculated, precise and successful military operations in my lifetime, \"Operation Absolute Resolve.\"\n\nI'm impressed with the planning, foresight and flawless execution, which involved more than \"150 aircraft launched from 20 bases around the Western Hemisphere, including F-35 and F-22 jets, and B-1 bombers,\" Reuters reported from a briefing by Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThis force for good was necessary to end an evil that permeated Venezuela, causing the country to rot from the disease of socialism. Maduro was a brutal dictator: His rule created a large-scale humanitarian crisis. Nearly 8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2014 after he came to power, more than 20% of the population.\n\nAs The Associated Press reported in August 2025, \"Maduro ‒ sworn in this year despite credible evidence he lost reelection ‒ has created economic conditions that largely limited people’s access to food nationwide, with the value of wages plummeting.\"\n\nMaduro was an active threat to America, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X in July.\n\nTrump's daring move has not only toppled a dictator who stole the last election from his own people, hopefully allowing for their duly elected, rightful president to lead, but it has also accomplished strategic dominance in an influential country. This move by Trump stops Venezuela from courting our enemies ‒ Russia, Iran and China ‒ to act against U.S. interests.\n\nWhy are Democrats against removing a dictator?\n\nImmediately following this historic raid, several top Democrats questioned why Trump authorized the attack and suggested it was both unauthorized and unconstitutional.\n\nI admit I just don't understand that reaction, and I am getting very tired of the left reflexively questioning Trump when he does something that garners applause from world leaders and the very people most affected − oppressed Venezuelans.\n\nThis same scrutiny was not applied to Democratic Presidents Joe Biden or Barack Obama during their terms. Obama did not receive explicit permission for the military operation that ultimately killed Osama bin Laden. Many Americans, including myself, applauded this.\n\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress passed the authorization for use of military force. It was presumed Obama hunted and killed bin Laden under this same authority. Obama also carried out thousands of drone strikes without congressional approval, and experts then believed he was justified.\n\nIn fact, prior to this raid, Democrats were outspoken about how awful Maduro was.\n\nIn August, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris offered $25 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest. Now Harris is blasting Trump for doing something their administration lacked the verve to do.\n\nIn a 2024 interview with MSNBC, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, actually thought Maduro was so bad, she claimed Trump wanted to be like him − because Trump was awful, too.\n\nTrump not only had the authority to execute this raid but also did not take this responsibility lightly. Condemning him for deposing a dictator from the position of a free America, right as exhausted Venezuelans are cheering their newfound liberty, seems like the wrong time for Democrats to clutch their pearls and feign moral outrage.\n\nI'm glad Trump put an end to the rule of Maduro, an actual dictator. The fact that millions around the globe are applauding the verve and gusto of this move, while the American left has the nerve to call Trump a dictator, too, is just more proof of why leftists have become lost, leaderless and irrelevant.\n\nI hope the president can finish the job, reinstate democracy to a people who actually want it, and let Venezuelans live freely and in peace. Kudos to Trump and our military: I voted for Trump, the liberator, and I'd do so again.\n\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY. She lives in Texas with her four kids.

The \"large scale strike against Venezuela\" was done \"in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement,\" President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social just after 4 a.m. ET on Saturday, Jan. 3.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi called Maduro and his wife \"two alleged international narco traffickers\" in a post on X on Jan. 3. Maduro has been indicted on charges of \"Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States,\" she said.\n\nThe attack comes just more than a month after Trump designated Maduro and his government allies of a foreign terrorist organization. And it also comes 36 years to the day from when the U.S. captured Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, the last time the U.S. made such a bold military action in the region.\n\nWhy did the US capture Maduro?\n\nPresident Trump has challenged the legitimacy of Maduro's 2024 election and accused the Venezuelan president of trafficking drugs into the U.S. During the first Trump administration, Maduro and more than a dozen other current and former Venezuelan officials were indicted by the U.S. in March 2020 for drug trafficking charges, announced by then-Attorney General William Barr.\n\nAs part of the administration's ongoing efforts to prevent drugs from flowing into the U.S., Trump declared fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction\" on Dec. 15.\n\nSubsequently, Trump ordered a blockade of ships from entering and leaving Venezuela and the U.S. seized several oil tankers exiting the country.\n\nBack in September, U.S. military forces began destroying boats originating from Venezuela because the boats allegedly carried drugs destined for the U.S., Trump said.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News on Saturday morning, Trump said the action was taken because drugs killed about 300,000 Americans each year. \"We don't lose that much in a war,\" he said. \"We are stopping drugs from coming into this country and nobody has been able to do it until we came along,\" Trump said.\n\nWhy is there tension between the US and Venezuela?\n\nThe situation is really more of the U.S. exerting pressure to oust Maduro.\n\nFollowing the first drug boat strikes, Trump said in October that ground strikes in Venezuela could come soon. \"We are certainly looking at land now because we've got the sea very well under control,\" Trump told reporters Oct. 15.\n\nA socialist and the handpicked successor of the late Hugo Chávez, Maduro has said Washington has plans to take control Venezuela's oil reserves, which are the largest in the world.\n\nTrump said he talked to Maduro a week ago and the Venezuelan leader was attempting to negotiate. \"I said 'You have to give up. You have to surrender',\" Trump said, speaking on Fox News. \"We had to do something that was really much more surgical, much more powerful.\"\n\nMaduro \"is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X after the strike. \"Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country.

Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who has announced he won’t seek reelection this year, said he worried the U.S. attack on Venezuela will be used to defend Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nBacon, a former brigadier general in the Air Force, said the military action was great for Venezuela, after Maduro’s rule.\n\n“My main concern now is that Russia will use this to justify their illegal and barbaric military actions against Ukraine, or China to justify an invasion of Taiwan,” Bacon said on social media. “Freedom and rule of law were defended last night, but dictators will try to exploit this to rationalize their selfish objectives.”\n\n–Bart Jansen\n\n'A lot of gunfire': Here's how the US raid to capture Maduro unfolded\n\nTrump administration indictment includes Maduro’s son\n\nNicolás Maduro’s son Nicolás Maduro (Jr.) Guerra, 35, is listed in the indictment charging the Venezuelan leader with narco-terrorism. A member of Venezuela's National Assembly, Guerra is also known as \"Nicolasito\" or \"The Prince,\" according to the court filing.\n\nBorn to his father's first wife, Adriana Guerra Angulo in 1990, Guerra began assisting in drug operations as early as 2014, according to the indictment. A deputy in his father's government, Guerra has been seen by many as a successor of the Chávismo movement, the socialistic ideology established by Venezuelan Pres. Hugo Chávez.\n\nThe indictment, signed by Jay Clayton, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, describes Guerra’s involvement in a drug operation starting in 2014 during which his plane \"would be loaded, sometimes with the assistance of armed sergeants, with large packages wrapped in tape that the captain understood were drugs.” Guerra helped ship “hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Venezuela to Miami” in 2017,” the court filing says.\n\nAbout 2020, Guerra met with two representatives of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) in Medellin, Colombia to discuss \"arrangements to move large quantities of cocaine and weapons through Colombia and into the United States over the course of the next six years,\" the filing says.\n\n−Mike Snider\n\nTwo House Republicans criticize Trump’s action in Venezuela\n\nA couple of House Republicans who have become vocal critics of Trump objected to the military operation.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, questioned on social media the constitutionality of the military action. He also noted the indictment against Maduro didn’t mention fentanyl or stolen oil that Trump has previously cited in complaints against Venezuela.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, who earlier resigned effective Jan. 5, said if Trump were interested prosecuting narco-terrorists, he wouldn’t have pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was serving a 45-year prison term for cocaine trafficking.\n\nGreene suggested controlling Venezuela’s oil could be a step toward pursuing regime change in Iran.\n\n“The next obvious observation is that by removing Maduro this is a clear move for control over Venezuelan oil supplies that will ensure stability for the next obvious regime change war in Iran,” Greene said on social media.\n\nTrump said while justifying the attack on Venezuela that Hernandez was prosecuted \"very unfairly.\"\n\n–Bart Jansen\n\nNYC Mayor Mamdani condemns US actions in Venezuela\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani condemned the American military actions in Venezuela as \"regime change\" violating international and federal law. Mamdani, a democratic socialist who took office Jan. 1, said he was briefed on the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and their transfer to federal custody in New York.\n\n“Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law,” Mamdani said in a statement. “This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home.”\n\nMamdani previously stopped short of calling Maduro a dictator, saying he hadn’t thought about the issue, but said his government was repressive. Later, Mamdani reportedly called Maduro and Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel dictators, and also said “punitive” U.S. policies had worsened conditions in their countries.\n\nNew York received large numbers of Venezuelan migrants seeking asylum during the Biden administration.\n\nMamdani later told reporters he had called Trump and spoke with him directly to express his opposition to American military actions in Venezuela.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMaduro raid took less than 5 hours after Trump’s order, general says\n\nGen. Dan Caine, an Air Force general who serves as Trump’s chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recounted a timeline of the raid.\n\nAlthough the military assets for the mission were in place in December, according to the four-star general, the attack was delayed until the weather “broke just enough” and in order to “minimize the potential for civilian harm and maximize the element of surprise and minimize the harm” to Maduro.\n\nTrump gave the go-ahead order at 10:46 p.m. ET, Caine said. (Caracas is one hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time.)\n\nThe raid involved aircraft and troops from 20 different bases “across the Western Hemisphere,” according to Caine.\n\nCaine indicated that intelligence and cyber forces helped deactivate Venezuela’s air defenses, some of which were also targeted by airstrikes.\n\nThe assault force, which CBS News reported was led by the Army’s elite Delta Force and included law enforcement personnel, landed at Maduro’s compound via helicopter at 1:01 a.m. ET.\n\nThe mission’s helicopters “came under fire” from Venezuelan defenders, Caine said, and attack helicopters accompanying the force returned fire and destroyed targets in the area.\n\nThe raid force captured Maduro and his wife while they were trying to flee to a safe room in the compound, Trump said in a phone interview with \"Fox & Friends\" earlier Saturday morning.\n\nCaine indicated that U.S. forces were also shot at while leaving Venezuelan airspace. An unknown number of U.S. troops were injured during the mission, Reuters previously reported.\n\n–Davis Winkie\n\nCuba a 'failing nation' similar to Venezuela, Trump says\n\nTrump called Cuba a “failing nation” and similar to Venezuela because the U.S. “wants to help the people in Cuba, but we want to also help the people that were forced out of Cuba and living in this country.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio called Cuba a “disaster” and said it “took over” Venezuela. Venezuelans “have to declare independence from Cuba,” Rubio said.\n\nVenezuelan oil plays a major role in economically supporting Cuba, which has been economically hobbled by decades of heavy U.S. sanctions.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nTrump: Congress wasn’t notified because they would 'leak'\n\nTrump said he didn’t notify Congress of the military actions in Venezuela because lawmakers “will leak, and we don’t want leakers.”\n\n“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Trump said. “This would not be good.”\n\nTrump said there was danger of any advanced warning of military strikes, but added Venezuelan officials knew the American military was coming.\n\nMoments earlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration didn’t tell Congress because it was a “trigger-based mission” in which conditions had to be met each night. “It’s just not the mission you can pre-notify because it endangers the mission,” Rubio said.\n\nRubio also pointed to the indictment against Maduro by the Department of Justice, and the military supported the Justice Department in his arrest.\n\nOn Jan. 3, Democratic and Republican lawmakers both said they weren't notified in advance.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nTrump declines to endorse opposition leader Machado to rule Venezuela\n\nTrump indicated that the administration had not spoken to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado about leading the country and argued that she does not have the internal support.\n\nTrump said it would be “very tough” for Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025, to lead the country.\n\n“She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the county,” Trump said at a news conference.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nThe U.S. will 'take a lot of money out' to 'take care' of Venezuela, Trump says\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is “old” and “rotted.” Much of it is “stuff we put there 20 years ago,” he said, apparently referencing Venezuela’s nationalization of its oil industry in 1976.\n\n“We’re going to be replacing it, and we’re going to take a lot of money out so we can take care of the country,” Trump said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nTrump’s message to Venezuelans after capture of Maduro\n\nTrump said his message to Venezuelans is that they are going to have “potentially a great country” after the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro and strikes around the country.\n\n“You’re going to have peace, justice, you’re going to have some of the riches that you should’ve had for a long period of time that was stolen from you,” Trump said.\n\n−Jeanine Santucci\n\nTrump says he's 'not afraid of boots on the ground' in Venezuela\n\nAsked whether U.S. military troops will remain in Venezuela as part of the United States “running” the country, President Donald Trump said “we’re not afraid of boots on the ground.”\n\n“We’re going to make sure that country is run properly. We’re not doing this in vain,” Trump said.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. forces “remain in the region at a high state of readiness.”\n\n−Jeanine Santucci\n\nRubio says Maduro could have fled but chose to stay\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at the president's news conference, said Maduro had plenty of warnings, and could have left the county.\n\n\"But instead he wanted to play big boy,\" Rubio said.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nOne aircraft hit but 'remained flyable,' Caine says\n\nDuring the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, one U.S. aircraft was hit but “remained flyable” for the rest of the mission, Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Jan. 3 news conference at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nU.S. troops faced “multiple self-defense engagements as the force began to withdraw from Venezuela,” Caine said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said that “not a single” U.S. servicemember was killed, and “not a single” piece of equipment was lost during the operation.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nJoint Chiefs chair: Mission ‘discreet, precise’\n\nGen. Dan “Razin” Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the complex raid, characterizing it as “an audacious operation that only the United States could do.”\n\nThe Air Force general emphasized the amount of planning that went into the mission to capture Maduro, noting that it required coordination between all branches of the military and intelligence agencies including the CIA, National Security Agency and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\n\n“The word integration does not explain the sheer complexity of such a mission, an extraction so precise it involved more than 150 aircraft launching across the Western Hemisphere in close coordination,” Caine said. “Failure of one component of this well-oiled machine would have endangered the entire mission, and failure is never an option for America’s joint force.”\n\n–Davis Winkie\n\nAmerican oil giants to 'spend billions' in oil-rich Venezuela, Trump says\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a news conference after he ordered U.S. forces to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that “very large oil companies” will spend “billions of dollars” in Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves of any nation worldwide.\n\n“The oil business has been a total bust,” Trump said of Venezuela’s oil, which is produced and controlled by a government-run company. “They were pumping almost nothing in.”\n\n“Very large US oil companies” will “go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure,” and “start making money for the country,” Trump said.\n\nChevron is the only American company that currently has access to Venezuelan oil, through a joint venture with the state-run company.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nTrump: 'We are going to run' Venezuela until transition\n\nHours after his administration struck Venezuela and deposed its president, President Donald Trump said at a Saturday news conference that the U.S. plans to run the country until a transition in leadership can take place.\n\n\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said, \"It has to be judicious, because that's what we are all about.”\n\nThe president did not immediately provide additional details on how the U.S. planned to manage the sovereign nation.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" earlier in the day, Trump declined to say whether he would back Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, for the presidency.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump posts photo of blindfolded Maduro aboard Navy ship\n\nPresident Donald Trump posted a photo of Nicolás Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima, a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship, where he was being held with his wife.\n\nThe photo shows Maduro in a gray sweatsuit, holding a water bottle and wearing what appeared to be noise-suppressing earmuffs and a dark covering over his eyes.\n\nMaduro and his wife will be taken to New York to face charges of drug trafficking in an indictment, Trump has said.\n\n−Jeanine Santucci\n\nMixed reactions from Latin American leaders\n\nSeveral Latin American leaders condemned the American military actions in Venezuela.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-wing leader whose country borders Venezuela, said in an X post that the strike crossed an “unacceptable line” that set “another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.”\n\nIn a statement, the government of Mexico said it “strongly condemns and rejects the military actions unilaterally carried out by American armed forces.”\n\nConservative allies of President Donald Trump in the region celebrated the actions.\n\n“FREEDOM ADVANCES” Argentinian President Javier Milei said on X. Chilean President-elect José Antonio Kast Rist called Maduro’s arrest “great news for the region.”\n\nIn an “urgent call for de-escalation,” Gustavo Petro, the left-wing president of Colombia who has frequently feuded with Trump, said his country would move to \"preserve stability\" along its border with Venezuela and address “eventual humanitarian or migratory needs.”\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nMaduro charged with narco-terrorism, cocaine conspiracy\n\nMaduro's federal indictment charges him with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and two illegal weapons counts.\n\nThe indictment also sought the seizure of any belongings that resulted from the alleged criminal conspiracy.\n\nMaduro “sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking,” the indictment said.\n\nOther defendants include Diosdado Cabello Rondon, Venezuela's minister of interior, justice and peace; Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, the former minister of interior and justice; first lady Cilia Adela Flores de Maduro; the president’s son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra, a member of the country’s national assembly; and the alleged leader of the crime gang Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nVance: Maduro capture legitimate because of indictments\n\nVice President JD Vance argued that Maduro’s capture was legitimate because he faces multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism.\n\n“You don't get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas,” Vance said on social media.\n\nVance said Trump had offered Maduro several options to avoid a military attack but that U.S. demands were clear that “drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”\n\n“Maduro is the newest person to find out that President Trump means what he says,” Vance said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: Maduro and wife held on ship, will face charges in NYC\n\nThe Venezuelan leader and his wife were being held on the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship, in the Caribbean, Trump told Fox news.\n\n\"They're on a ship, but they'll be heading into New York. The helicopters took them out,\" Trump said. \"A nice flight, I'm sure they loved it. They've killed a lot of people.\"\n\n\"Even people in their own country, they killed a lot of people to maintain power,\" Trump added. \"He's a very vicious person.\"\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nUS forces mostly unharmed, Trump says\n\nPresident Trump told Fox news in a phone interview that, as far as he knows, no U.S. forces were killed and no American aircraft were lost during the overnight strike on Venezuela.\n\n“I think we had nobody killed,” Trump said. “A couple of guys were hit, but they came back, and they’re supposed to be in pretty good shape.”\n\nOne U.S. helicopter was hit hard, Trump added, but the U.S. was able to recover it.\n\n−Francesca Chambers\n\nDemocrats rip Trump over Venezuela\n\nDemocratic lawmakers accused the Trump administration of conducting an illegal war with Venezuela and misleading Congress about the purpose of its strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean after the U.S. bombed the country and captured its leader overnight.\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego, an Iraq war veteran who represents Arizona, called the strike the “second unjustified war in my life time” in a social media post.\n\n“This war is illegal, it’s embarrassing that we went from the world cop to the world bully in less than one year,” Gallego said.\"\n\nHawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said the U.S. has “no vital national interests in Venezuela to justify war” and the nation should “have learned not to stumble into another stupid adventure by now.”\n\nSen. Andy Kim of New Jersey, said on X that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told senators during a December briefing that the seizure of Venezuelan oil tankers and strikes on alleged drug boats were not about regime change.\n\n“I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress. Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,” Kim said.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-California, called Maduro “a thug and an illegitimate leader of Venezuela,” but said terrorizing and oppressing his people didn’t justify Trump “trampling the Constitution.”\n\n“Acting without Congressional approval or the buy-in of the public, Trump risks plunging a hemisphere into chaos and has broken his promise to end wars instead of starting them,’ Schiff said in a statement.\n\n−Francesca Chambers and Bart Jansen\n\nMaduro grab comes after Trump pardoned drug trafficking former Honduran leader\n\nThe U.S. capture of Maduro comes just weeks after President Trump gave a full pardon to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted and serving a 45-year sentence in federal prison for cocaine distribution.\n\nTrump announced he planned to pardon Hernández on Nov. 28, 2025, and White House officials confirmed the pardon by Dec. 2.\n\nHernández was convicted in March 2024 of conspiring with drug kingpins to bring more than 400 tons of cocaine into the United States in what then-Attorney General Merrick Garland called “one of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking conspiracies in the world.”\n\nIn a social media post, Trump said the former Honduran president had been “treated very harshly and unfairly.”\n\n−Jeanine Santucci\n\nRussia blasts US attack, Argentina's president celebrates\n\nRussia's foreign ministry said the U.S. strikes on Venezueala were \"deeply concerning and condemnable.\"\n\n\"The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"Ideological animosity has prevailed over business pragmatism and the willingness to build relationships based on trust and predictability.\"\n\n\"In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue.\"\n\nRussia has been an ally of Venezuela's even as the U.S. turned against its socialist government. Maduro and Russian President Vladimir Putin last met in Moscow in May.\n\nBrazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva said the \"bombings on Venezuelan territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line,\" one of many condemnations from Latin American leaders, while Argentinian President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, posted in all caps: \"FREEDOM MOVES FORWARD. LONG LIVE FREEDOM DAMMIT.\"\n\nWhy did the US capture Maduro?\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, will face trial on U.S. soil on charges of \"Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post to X.\n\n\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi wrote.\n\nBondi's post appeared to reference charges Maduro and his top officials have already faced since 2020, when they were indicted by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Flores was not charged in those indictments.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nMaduro capture echoes arrest of Noriega in Panama three decades ago\n\nExactly 36 years before the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in an early morning military operation in Venezuela, U.S. forces seized Panamanian General Manuel Noriega on Jan. 3, 1990.\n\nThe arrest of Noriega shares more similarities with the Trump administration's alleged capture of Maduro than just a date on the calendar. Noriega was first a CIA asset before he rose to power as Panama's military strongman leader. The U.S. indicted him on drug trafficking charges, and in late 1989, then-President George H.W. Bush dispatched tens of thousands of troops to Panama to capture Noriega and bring him to face trial in the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration's effort to oust Maduro also centered on his alleged ties to drug trafficking, for which he was charged by a U.S. court in 2020. Experts have said that, while Maduro's regime profits from drug trafficking, he does not lead a vast drug smuggling network like the role Noriega played.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nShocked Venezuelans hunker down\n\nVenezuelan security forces patrolled largely empty streets at dawn in the capital, Caracas, hours after loud explosions woke residents to the news that U.S. commandos had bombed the country and captured President Maduro.\n\nStreets close to the Miraflores presidential palace were deserted except for checkpoints manned by uniformed gunmen, as residents were left guessing who was now in charge of the oil-rich nation.\n\nSmoke streaked the sky, with a dark plume still billowing from the direction of the Port of La Guaira to the north, while another was visible near an air base in the capital.\n\nFor supporters of the opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, excitement was also in the air.\n\n\"My sister, who is in the United States, woke me up with the news; she was crying. We cried together out of happiness,\" said Jairo Chacin, 39, a mechanic and workshop owner in oil hub Maracaibo, as he waited in a long line to stock up on groceries.\n\n−Reuters\n\nSenate Intel chairman confirms Maduro will face charges\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton said Saturday morning that he’d spoken to Marco Rubio and the Trump official confirmed that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is in U.S. custody and will face criminal charges.\n\n“Nicolas Maduro wasn’t just an illegitimate dictator; he also ran a vast drug-trafficking operation. That’s why he was indicted in U.S. court nearly six years ago for drug trafficking and narco-terrorism,” Cotton said in a post on X.\n\nThe Arkansas Republican said, “The interim government in Venezuela must now decide whether to continue the drug trafficking and colluding with adversaries like Iran and Cuba or whether to act like a normal nation and return to the civilized world. I urge them to choose wisely.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the Trump administration notified Cotton, one of the top congressional leaders on intelligence matters, before the strike took place.\n\n–Francesca Chambers\n\nVenezuela calls for urgent United Nations meeting\n\nVenezuela called for an urgent United Nations Security Council meeting after President Trump announced the U.S. had captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in an early morning military operation on Jan. 3.\n\nIn a letter dated that day, Venezuela's representative to the U.N. denounced the U.S. \"armed aggression\" and its \"grave implications\" for peace and security. The letter was addressed to Abukar Dahir Osman, Somalia's U.N. ambassador, who took over the rotating presidency of the Security Council on Jan. 1, and was posted to X by Yvan Gil, Venezuela's foreign minister.\n\nU.S. military forces had carried out \"brutal, unjustified and unilateral\" attacks in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, and other cities in the country, the letter said.\n\nThe statement called on governments of Latin America to mobilize in solidarity with Venezuela in response to what the letter called an attack on regional independence.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nMaduro will 'stand trial' in U.S., senator says\n\nRepublican Sen.

The unit carried out the 2019 raid that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.\n\nVideos from Caracas circulating on social media showed several helicopters flying over the city and firing at targets.

Maduro and some high-level Venezuelan officials were indicted the next year in a U.S. court on drug trafficking and corruption charges.\n\nA former bus driver, Maduro rose through the ranks of Hugo Chavez' socialist party and took over as his handpicked successor after an election held after Chavez' death in 2013.\n\nMaduro has been widely accused by election monitoring organizations and the Venezuelan opposition of rigging the next two elections to stay in power.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nUS citizens in Venezuela should 'shelter in place,' leave: embassy\n\nThe State Department acknowledged \"reports of explosions in and around Caracas, Venezuela,\" in a post to the U.S. Embassy Venezuela website.\n\n\"U.S. citizens in Venezuela should shelter in place and depart immediately when it is safe to do so,\" said the post by the U.S. Embassy Colombia.

The campaign escalated to include the seizure of oil tankers coming and going from Venezuelan ports in late December.\n\nA sizeable American flotilla has amassed in the southern Caribbean Sea, including multiple guided missile destroyers, a missile cruiser, and a Marine Corps amphibious ready group aboard Navy landing ships. The U.S. publicly moved the USS Gerald R. Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – into the region in recent months as well.\n\nJust days before the apparent attack, President Donald Trump confirmed that the CIA conducted a land strike against a dock facility in the country.\n\nThe administration has attacked at least 35 boats traversing international waters, killing at least 115 people − many of them Venezuelans. Trump and other officials have defended the boat strikes as an attempt to stop illegal narcotics, specifically fentanyl, from flooding into the country.\n\n\"The Biden administration preferred the kid gloves approach, allowing millions of people — including dangerous cartels and unvetted Afghans — to flood our communities with drugs and violence,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a Nov. 29 post on X, when he lashed out at a report that he ordered U.S. military officials to leave no survivors during one of the Caribbean sea strikes.\n\nSenator calls attacks a 'stupid adventure'\n\nLawmakers from both parties have criticized the Trump administration's military attacks for providing no intelligence briefings or other evidence about what the vessels are carrying.

Dan Caine, in a news conference at 11 a.m. Saturday, said the operation involved more than 150 aircraft and personnel from the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, including the CIA, National Security Agency, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.\n\nIt took months of intelligence work \"to find Maduro and understand how he moved, where he lived, where he traveled, what he ate, what he wore, what were his pets,\" Caine said.

U.S. military troops swooping in by helicopter. A foreign leader, accused of drug trafficking, hauled off to America in handcuffs.\n\nThe Trump administration’s capture of President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3 bore some familiar echoes to the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama that ousted military strongman Manuel Noriega − and marked the most direct U.S. intervention in Latin America since.\n\nBut experts say that despite some similarities, the two key moments in America’s long and checkered history of interventions differ in major ways that could make achieving U.S. goals more challenging this time after a raid that has revived regional anxiety.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Jan. 3 that his administration will “run the country” for a time and described an apparent nation-building effort. He said it would be funded by Venezuela’s vast oil reserves to be tapped by American oil companies, some of which were forced out in the 2000s.\n\nThough many in Panama view Noriega’s ouster as setting it on a path to become a growing and stable democracy, despite the deaths and trauma, that result is far less certain in a much bigger and complex nation beset by poverty, crime and lingering resistance, experts said.\n\nShaping a post-invasion future was a much easier task in relatively tiny Panama, in part because American troops linked to the Panama Canal were there before and after the invasion, said Will Freeman, a Latin America fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThough details remain scant, Freeman said he doubts the United States will field a full Iraq-style occupation force.\n\n“This is not going to be so simple in Venezuela,” he said. “One, it's not even likely that we get to democracy. And two, many of the problems that were there with Maduro are going to remain.”\n\nLeaders seek in vain to avoid capture\n\nTrump’s announcement of the raid came 36 years after the United States took Noriega into custody.\n\nThe famously acne-pocked military strongman was once a U.S. ally who had been recruited by the CIA to stanch the spread of communism. But he drew increasing U.S. ire for growing hostility and actions such as annulling an election and cracking down violently on opposition.\n\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush, citing authoritarian rule, concerns about the security of the Panama Canal and U.S. drug trafficking and money laundering charges, ordered Operation Just Cause. It tapped more than 20,000 U.S. troops, many of them already in Panama, to seize control of military and infrastructure sites. A new president was sworn in soon after.\n\nMaduro’s capture also stems from a history of conflict with the United States.\n\nMaduro came to power as the successor to President Hugo Chávez, a socialist leader who gained leadership in the late 1990s. The nation has since faced a mix of authoritarianism and skyrocketing poverty, crime and inflation.\n\nLike Noriega, Maduro was indicted by U.S. prosecutors in 2020 on drug trafficking charges. But he was a less significant figure in drugs than Noriega or Juan Orlando Hernandez, the former president of Honduras, whom Trump recently pardoned, said Michael Shifter, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service.\n\nPressure to oust Maduro gained steam since Trump’s reelection last year. And in recent months, a U.S. military buildup in the region included aircraft carriers and fatal military strikes on small boats suspected of carrying drugs.\n\nAir Force Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. authorities spent time tracking Maduro’s daily routines and moves before the raid in which Maduro was captured by U.S. special forces at his compound.\n\nAs U.S. forces cut power and descended on Maduro, the military encountered some resistance, including a helicopter struck by a bullet, and returned fire. Maduro did not make it to a reinforced steel safe room he was trying to reach, Caine said. Images and video showed explosions, burning vehicles, plumes of smoke rising over the capital city of Caracas, and a swarm of low-flying helicopters.\n\nBy that night, Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were in New York, where he stands accused of trafficking cocaine during a 25-year career in public posts.\n\nMore than three decades earlier, Noriega also tried to slip away, driving through the streets to evade capture and eventually hiding in the Vatican Embassy on Dec. 24.\n\nSurrounded by U.S. forces, who couldn’t storm the site, the U.S. military blasted constant music by Alice Cooper and Black Sabbath on loudspeakers, according to official accounts. He surrendered on Jan. 3, 1990.\n\nNoriega was convicted and spent the rest of his life in U.S., French and Panamanian prisons. He died in 2017.\n\nInterventions bring criticism and challenges\n\nBoth attacks were part of a century-long history of U.S. intervention – directly and indirectly – in the politics of Latin American countries such as Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\n\nIn the 1950s, for example, the United States sought to remove Guatemala's democratically elected president amid land reforms that were affecting the U.S.-based United Fruit Company's exploitative labor practices.\n\nThe United States helped install a military dictatorship whose policies eventually triggered a civil war and led to mass human rights abuses. More than 200,000 Guatemalans were killed or simply disappeared.\n\nDuring the Panama invasion, at least 514 Panamanian soldiers and civilians were killed. Some local reports, however, put the figure at double that. Twenty-three U.S. military personnel were killed. And the event was viewed by opponents as another example of the United States ignoring sovereignty.\n\nAt that time, the United States sought to carry out a relatively quick intervention at a time when leaders were keen to avoid a quagmire, said Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University.\n\nIn contrast, the Trump administration has turned away from the post-Cold War international order in actions and policies that have also drawn comparison to President Theodore Roosevelt’s take on the Monroe Doctrine that the United States should \"exercise international police power\" to end what Roosevelt called \"chronic unrest or wrongdoing\" in the hemisphere.\n\nAnd it comes as some countries in Latin America have made a move to right-leaning governments. More were heading away from authoritarian leadership during the time of the Panama invasion, Gamarra said.\n\nTrump has criticized Venezuela, which nationalized its oil industry in the 1970s, for added expropriations and other changes in the 2000s that forced many major U.S. oil companies out and led to legal battles over compensation.\n\nThough Trump said his administration plans to oversee Venezuela, U.S. forces have no control over the country itself, Reuters reported, though Trump didn’t rule out having some “boots on the ground.”\n\n\"We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,\" Trump said at a news conference Jan. 3.\n\nTrump also said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez had no choice but to be cooperative, but Rodriguez appeared on Venezuelan television Saturday afternoon with other top officials to decry what she called a kidnapping.\n\nThe administration's efforts will face complexities not present in Panama decades ago, such as the presence of large oil reserves and security challenges from criminal groups to illegal mining interests, Shifter said.\n\nUncertainty also stems from mixed reactions – some celebrating hopes for new freedom and others saying a line had been crossed – in a region where the military action revived anxieties about past U.S. interventions.\n\nIn Panama, which has drawn the spotlight of the Trump administration over immigration and canal oversight, Panama's president, José Raúl Mulino, weighed in on social media that included support of the \"democratic process and the acceptance of the legitimate wishes of the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nThough the invasion of Panama 36 years ago wasn’t widely seen as a precursor to other interventions, Trump’s rhetoric aimed at Colombia, Mexico and Cuba over various disputes including illegal drugs has left some countries on edge.\n\n“U.S. military intervention in the region has not always had a very happy record. And so I think that creates a lot of anxiety and a lot of apprehension,” Shifter said. “If there are no limits and no rules, you know, why can't Trump do the same to them?”\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/03/trump-strike-venezuela-maduro/88004393007/", "title": "Trump says US conducted strike on Venezuela, captured Maduro", "text": "Updated Jan. 3, 2026, 12:39 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON − President Donald Trump said no American forces appear to have been killed and no aircraft was lost during an overnight strike on Venezuela, in which the U.S. seized the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife and bombed targets in the capital city of Caracas and elsewhere.\n\nTrump said Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were in a \"highly-guarded\" compound that was \"like a fortress\" when they captured by the U.S. military and forcibly removed from the country.

He did it the wrong way | Opinion", "text": "Jan. 3, 2026 Updated Jan. 5, 2026, 12:31 p.m. ET\n\nEarly on Jan. 3, U.S. law enforcement and military personnel conducted an operation that captured Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. He was indicted in federal court on weapon and drug charges.\n\nMaduro’s capture is good for the United States and good for the people of Venezuela. America was morally and practically justified in acting, even if some legal debates remain.\n\nAt the outset, I want to say the most important thing here: It is good that Maduro is no longer in power. The caveat is that, though I like the end result, President Donald Trump should have sought authorization from Congress, even though his actions are in line with those of past presidents in that regard.\n\nRegime change in Venezuela is a noble goal and in America's interest\n\nMaduro was an illegitimate leader who stole elections and locked up those who protested.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nThere was ample evidence that he had used his power to traffic narcotics into the United States, and the Venezuelan regime oppresses its own citizens. Mass shortages from these policies have led to malnutrition and starvation.\n\nThe liberation of the Venezuelan people from such a regime would be a good thing, and if America is in the business of nation-building, I pray we succeed. There are difficulties with achieving that result, and there will surely be intense debates over what role the United States should play in the future of Venezuela. However, removing Maduro from the picture is the essential first step. The celebrations from Venezuelans both in-country and abroad should put a smile on all of our faces.\n\nSo, too, is it good for the United States that Maduro is gone. It is good to uproot a regime that traffics drugs into our country, likely contributing to the deaths of many Americans and the destruction of even more lives.\n\nIt is good for America to have one less hostile regime that is allied with Russia, China, Cuba and Iran in our hemisphere.\n\nReasserting our control over our region is a noble goal. The anxiety felt by Mexican drug cartels and the hostile Cuban regime stemming from this ought to serve as a powerful deterrent against their own anti-American actions.\n\nThose who think such functions of the federal government are not in the interest of America are shortsighted. If we can prevent drug trafficking, we should do so. If we can uproot hostile regimes in our immediate surroundings without entering into full-scale war, we should do so. If we can weaken China, Russia, Cuba, Iran or any other country that hates us, we should do so.\n\nThese functions are essential to U.S. security and dominance.\n\nThe legality of Trump administration's Maduro operation is gray\n\nThe legality of the operation is far less cut and dry than the moral and practical rationales. The ability to make war resides in Congress, and the president must seek authorization from the legislative branch.\n\nThe Trump administration has tried to get around this by labeling it a primarily law-enforcement operation, but that's an argument of semantics and doesn’t truly change the legality of the operation.\n\nIn addition, the fact that we are now entertaining the possibility of running the country to some degree undermines the pure law-enforcement explanation.\n\nRegardless of the motivation, we took hostile action to interfere with another nation’s sovereignty, and that does require congressional approval. Trump should have gone to Congress to get authorization for the mission. Fears of leaks are understandable, but that doesn’t change the demands of the Constitution.\n\nThat being said, the military actions of presidents this century have more or less set the precedent that Trump can act in such a manner without congressional authorization. The fact that this is the status quo doesn’t make it right, but it does eliminate the partisan angles of these actions, given that Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Joe Biden have all taken actions outside of congressional authorization. At no point has Congress actually taken up the mantle of reasserting its war powers as a body.\n\nA proper interpretation of the presidential war powers would mean that Trump went through Congress to take action in Venezuela. Congress should be on board with such actions, but Trump did not give them a chance to be on the right side of this one. Trump’s actions are in line with the status quo of presidential war powers, but not in line with the constitutionally proper interpretation.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/05/joe-biden-stance-nicolas-maduro-venezuela/88028292007/", "title": "What does Joe Biden think about Nicolás Maduro?", "text": "Updated Jan. 5, 2026, 3:55 p.m. ET\n\nAn old social media post by former President Joe Biden is sparking debate after the United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a surprise attack on the oil-rich country.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, appeared in federal court in New York City on Jan. 5 and pleaded not guilty to felony charges including drug trafficking and money laundering less than two days after US troops seized them.

Later that year, the reward was increased to $50 million under Trump.\n\nAt a news conference after Maduro's capture on Jan. 3, Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that nobody would be paid the reward money.\n\n\"I guess we save $50 million,\" Rubio said.\n\n\"Don't let anybody claim it. Nobody deserves it but us,\" Trump replied.\n\nBiden on Maduro's election\n\nMaduro, 63, has led Venezuela since 2013, when he became president as the hand-picked successor of Hugo Chávez.\n\nMaduro was in his third consecutive term as president after claiming victory in a 2024 election that was widely condemned by international observers, including the Biden administration, as fraudulent.\n\nIn July 2024, Biden administration officials accused the Venezuelan government of \"electoral manipulation.\"\n\nThe following month, when asked whether he supported a new election in Venezuela, Biden responded, \"I do,\" Barrons reported.\n\nThat same day, during an Aug. 15, 2024, news conference, Biden State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said Venezuela's election committee \"fell short of basic transparency and integrity measures and it didn't follow national legal and regulatory provisions.\"\n\nBiden on Venezuelan asylum-seekers\n\nIn March 2021, the Biden administration announced it would offer temporary legal status to people who fled Maduro's regime. The move offered protections to as many as 300,000 Venezuelans who had been living in the U.S.\n\nAt the time, Biden's Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said Venezuela was a country \"in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens” and dealing with crises of hunger, malnutrition and a growing presence of violent militia groups.\n\nShortly before the end of his first term in January 2021, Trump signed an executive order that deferred the removal of more than 145,000 Venezuelans for 18 months.\n\nBiden on Venezuela sanctions, prisoner swap\n\nThe U.S. has been imposing various sanctions on Venezuela since 2005, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nIn 2023, the Biden administration agreed to lift some oil sanctions on Venezuela as part of an agreement with the Maduro government to ensure free and fair elections.\n\nThat December, Biden's administration released a Maduro ally from U.S. custody in exchange for 10 Americans detained in Venezuela and the return of a notorious fugitive who had fled the U.S.\n\nThe Biden administration reinstated oil sanctions in April 2024, saying Maduro had not lived up to his promise of free elections.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Biden's team for comment.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

See where cases are rising.", "text": "Jan. 6, 2026 Updated Jan. 7, 2026, 4:31 p.m. ET\n\nFlu activity is exploding across the United States this flu and cold season, in some cases reaching record highs, according to new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nFor the first time since 1997, when flu data was first tracked, 8% of visits to medical professionals were related to the flu or a flu-like illness the week ending Dec. 27, according to the CDC. Hospitalizations increased a whopping 48% week-over-week, amounting to 120,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths so far this season.\n\nA new mutation, called subclade K, continues to drive the spread, with some experts warning that it could supercharge the season. Here's what to know about the state of flu in the U.S. this week.\n\nIs it too late to get a flu shot? What to know about vaccine's effectiveness.\n\nHow many flu cases were reported nationwide?\n\nFlu cases have skyrocketed since December began, according to CDC data, and flu activity is now categorized as \"high\" nationwide.\n\nCDC data through Dec. 27 showed that just under 33% (23,350) of the 70,757 flu tests administered that week were reported positive to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System. This was up from just 9% during the first week of December.\n\nIn some regions, specifically Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, that number was as high as over 45%. The CDC also noted that flu activity was \"very high\" in the Northeast the week ending Dec. 27, including in New York, Massachusetts and North Carolina.\n\nWastewater data maintained by WasteWaterSCAN, a Stanford University-led tool for tracking the spread of disease, also categorized flu activity as \"high,\" marking a 146% increase in the median concentration between the first and last weeks of December, which means more of the virus has been detected in the wastewater of more communities nationwide.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, CDC projections found that flu infections are on the rise in 17 states, unchanged or not reported in seven states and declining or likely declining in 24.\n\nMap of flu activity by state\n\nFlu season is underway. What are common symptoms to watch for?\n\nWhat is the new flu strain?\n\nA new flu strain that has been dominating cold and flu season overseas has also taken over in the U.S.\n\nThe mutated strain, known as subclade K, originates from the most common flu-causing virus, influenza A, and one of its most common variations, H3N2. Influenza A is typically the virus associated with the term \"flu\" and has evolved into many different strains over time.\n\nEach year, the seasonal flu shot is formulated to target the strains most commonly circulating. One of those, H3N2, has been present for decades, according to the CDC and the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, but its most recent mutation is different enough that the vaccine made to target H3N2 for the 2025-2026 season is not as effective against it.\n\nBecause it is structurally different, subclade K may also be better at dodging immune systems that have already built up protections against more familiar strains. This year's vaccine isn't totally useless against subclade K, however.\n\nPreliminary data shows that the vaccine is still providing protection and rates of hospitalization and serious illnesses are comparable to last year in Europe, according to the Pan American Health Organization and research published in the medical journal Eurosurveillance.\n\nThe last available tracing data from the CDC found that 91% of the 600 U.S. flu cases that were tested between Dec. 22 and 28 were caused by H3N2. Additionally, 90.5% of the 389 H3N2 viruses sent for further testing during that time were subclade K.\n\nWhat are the latest flu symptoms?\n\nSymptoms associated with H3N2 are similar to those of other influenza viruses and include:\n\nFever\n\nCough\n\nRunny nose\n\nFatigue\n\nMuscle aches and chills\n\nHow to protect yourself from the flu\n\nYou may be tired of hearing it, but the old cliche is true: Washing your hands well – and often – is one of the best ways to keep contagious illnesses at bay, according to the CDC. This applies to all the ailments above and others that often circulate during the wintertime, like respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.\n\nHealth agencies recommend washing your hands with hot, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. It's also important to wash them before and after eating, before and after handling food, after using the bathroom and after being around sick people or touching surfaces that could be contaminated. Mask-wearing while sick or out and about during illness season can also help to prevent the spread.\n\nThe most effective way to prevent serious illness from flu is vaccination, according to the World Health Organization, CDC and other leading medical institutions. Everyone 6 months and older is eligible for the flu vaccine unless they have a specified medical condition, such as an allergy to its ingredients or a previous severe reaction to the shot.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/06/17/bird-flu-michigan-wastewater/74047810007/", "title": "Bird flu in Michigan wastewater highest in U.S.: What it means", "text": "June 17, 2024 Updated June 18, 2024, 6:12 p.m. ET\n\nNewly released wastewater surveillance data suggests Michigan is a national hot spot for the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that's infecting poultry, dairy cows and other mammals across the U.S., and has also been identified in three farmworkers — two in Michigan.\n\nResearchers told the Free Press they're still trying to understand exactly why samples from all six of Michigan's wastewater testing sites monitored by WastwaterSCAN show high levels of the H5 influenza A virus — the most detections of any of the 38 states with sampling sites — even in areas like Jackson and Warren, where there are no known H5N1 outbreaks among dairy cows, poultry or people this year.\n\n\"It's clear that there's something going on,\" said Marisa Eisenberg, an associate professor in the departments of epidemiology, complex systems and mathematics at the University of Michigan. \"We have had questions like: Are we having so much activity for H5N1 in general in Michigan because we're looking for it or is it that we are really a hot spot? I think the wastewater is really telling us that we actually are seeing more activity for H5 than other places are.\n\n\"Now as for why, that is a fascinating question. I don't feel like we have a handle on it yet.\"\n\nAmong the questions scientists are trying to answer:\n\nAre there more infected dairy cattle in the state than is currently known?\n\nAre people unknowingly infected, carrying the virus and excreting H5 particles into the wastewater system?\n\nOr is there some other source that's causing Michigan's H5 wastewater detections to rise above other states?\n\nWastewaterSCAN, which is based at Stanford University and monitors infectious diseases through wastewater systems, publicly posted the results of H5 influenza A virus testing of samples from 38 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia dating to May 21.\n\nOnly six states had detections of the virus in the wastewater — California, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan and Texas — as of Monday. Of them all, Michigan was the only state with high levels detected at each of its six testing sites: Ann Arbor, Jackson, Jenison, Mount Pleasant, Traverse City and Warren.\n\nEven though Jackson County has yet to identify any infections among dairy cattle with the H5N1 influenza A virus, the highest number of positive wastewater samples, 10, were identified at the city of Jackson's Wastewater Treatment Plant from May 21-June 9.\n\nThe city of Warren's Wastewater Treatment Plant had the second highest number of H5 influenza detections in wastewater samples statewide with five identified from May 21-June 11, but Macomb County also has no known dairy cattle outbreaks.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that blood sample tests suggest Americans have \"extremely low to no population immunity\" to the H5N1 virus strain circulating now. Seasonal flu vaccines don't appear to have produced any antibodies to the virus.\n\nThat means \"most of the population would be susceptible to infection from this virus if it were to start infecting people easily and spreading from person-to-person,\" the CDC said.\n\nSleuthing the source of H5 virus in wastewater\n\nExcrement doesn't lie when it comes to infectious disease.\n\n\"Clearly, there's a lot of virus in the wastewater,\" said Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds and a member of the faculty at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nWhether that virus is coming from waste runoff from cattle farms with infected cows or other animals, discharge of untreated milk into the wastewater system from production facilities, or someplace else, however, isn't easy to untangle.\n\n\"The wastewater takes the genetic material from the virus and we know there's a lot of genetic material from the virus in milk. Is it just milk being detected in the wastewater?\" Webby hypothesized. \"Somebody drinks milk, that goes through the digestive tract and is detected at the other end? Maybe.\"\n\nH5N1 viral particles have been identified in pasteurized milk in the commercial market, and though those particles are inactive and not capable of causing infection, it is possible they could be detected by testing samples of wastewater, said Alessandro Zulli, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University who works with WastewaterSCAN on research and wastewater sampling for viruses.\n\n\"There's a good chance that the little sort of snippet that we measure, the amplicon, could still be present in wastewater,\" Zulli said. \"Now, that depends on a lot of factors. It depends on whether people are dumping a bunch of milk down the drain; it's unlikely, I think, that it would pass through your entire digestive system without being further broken apart.\"\n\nEisenberg agreed that Michigan's high rate of H5 virus detections in wastewater isn't likely driven by milk drinkers who've excreted viral particles into the wastewater system.\n\n\"Everyone is drinking milk\" in every state nationally, she said. \"So if it was just milk, regular milk that you're buying at the store, I feel like we would be seeing much more widespread detections\" across the U.S.\n\nShe is investigating whether milk production plants near Jackson and Warren discharge milk into the catchment areas where wastewater samples are drawn. Eisenberg said she is also curious about septage.\n\n\"Are there septic tank companies that ... pull from septic tanks, but then it goes into the wastewater treatment plant?\" she asked. \"The wastewater treatment plants sometimes will accept septage from septic tank companies.\n\n\"We're still at the hypothesis-generating stage. There's some ponds and wetlands that go into the wastewater system. So could it be wild birds or is there some septage that's coming from Jackson's neighboring counties that have had cattle detections? Maybe it's something like that?\"\n\nShe wondered whether all the dairy farms in Jackson County have been tested for H5N1 infections, too.\n\n\"We're still trying to get to the bottom of it,\" Eisenberg said.\n\nIn Macomb County, Eisenberg said, some major dairy processing operations occur within the catchment area of the wastewater treatment plant in Warren, \"which might explain the positives there.\"\n\nWebby said he doubts Michigan's H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and cattle — or its high wastewater detections — are linked to migratory bird activity in the state. Michigan is part of the Mississippi Flyway.\n\n\"We can say with some certainty that it's not because you're a flyway,\" Webby said. \"This is based on looking at the sequences of the viruses that are available from this outbreak,\" which suggest the virus is being spread from cow-to-cow and cow-to-person in the state, and not bird-to-cow or bird-to-person.\n\nZulli agreed that wild birds probably aren't driving up H5 wastewater detections in Michigan.\n\n\"There is some speculation about how bird waste could get into the wastewater stream, but it's unlikely,\" he said. \"In some of our previous retrospective studies, we haven't been able to see it before from bird waste. I mean, of course, as it gets more widespread in birds, the chances of it actually ending up in the wastewater stream increase. But we currently don't really think that it's intrusion from bird wastewater so much as it is from either permitted discharges of dairy cattle farms or other runoff of that type.\n\n\"A lot more work is necessary before we can extrapolate and say where exactly it's coming from or whether the contributions are from humans or animals.\"\n\n'This is the most active form of virus we have ever had'\n\nThe wastewater data poses new questions as the H5N1 virus continues to spread nationally, infecting 92 dairy cattle herds in 12 states as of Friday and more than 96 million poultry in 48 states, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Michigan, H5N1 outbreaks have disrupted operations at 25 dairy cattle farms across 10 counties, cutting the animals' milk production and eating into farmers' already slim profit margins, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nThe state's commercial egg and poultry farms also have felt the economic sting of the virus, as operations in 23 counties over the last two years have culled at least 6.8 million domestic birds infected with avian influenza.\n\nSo far, this strain of the avian influenza virus circulating in the U.S., identified as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, has caused only mild illness in people who were infected after working closely with sick cows; all fully recovered. Two of the dairy farmworkers had eye infections, known as conjunctivitis or pink eye. A third reported upper respiratory tract symptoms. Federal and state health leaders say the risk among the general public is low.\n\nThe concern among many scientists, though, is how this virus is adapting and changing — and whether some of those changes might make it more infectious, allow for human-to-human transmission, reduce the effectiveness of current antiviral drugs or cause more severe illness or a higher mortality rate.\n\n\"Over the past 25 years of this virus, this is the most active form of virus we have ever had,\" Webby said. \"We're seeing far more mammals infected with this virus in the past three years than we probably have over the whole 23 years before this. And now it has found its way into cows.\n\n\"Every corner we turn, this virus is teaching us something we didn't know. This time, it's that it can actually replicate in cows. ... It was a surprise to most of us.\n\n\"Right now, it looks like it is still the virus that is in birds with maybe a few little changes. But we want to be able to know if this virus is changing, is it becoming more dangerous for humans? Is it becoming more dangerous for cows and other animals as well?\"\n\nVirus can hitch a ride\n\nThe USDA published an epidemiological report Thursday based on Michigan's dairy and poultry outbreak, and found that the virus likely is being spread by animal and human movement from farms with infected poultry and cows to those without.\n\nThe virus can hitch a ride from farm to farm on the soles of workers' boots, on the wheels of cars, trucks and trailers as well as on farming equipment if they all are not cleaned and sanitized properly, the USDA found.\n\nAbout 20% of the dairy farms the federal agency analyzed in Michigan shared workers with other farming operations and 13% had workers or family members who also worked on poultry farms. Many used veterinarians, nutritionists, feed consultants, milk haulers and other contractors who had direct contact with cattle on multiple dairy farms and shared vehicles across farms.\n\n\"Based on the epidemiological findings, the majority of links between affected dairy premises, and between dairy and poultry premises, are indirect from shared people, vehicles, and equipment,\" the report said, recommending increased biosecurity practices and efforts to identify as many infected herds as possible.\n\nBut it's not easy to get farm operators or farmworkers to agree to testing. And though Michigan has done more testing than many other states, that doesn't fully explain why Michigan leads the nation in H5N1 infected dairy herds, people, and now, wastewater detections.\n\n\"I think there is a lot of surprise at the actual lack of testing that's actually going on,\" Webby said. \"Other countries are in different positions where federal agencies can say, 'I'm coming on your farm to test animals,' which is not of course how it's done here.\"\n\nTesting animals and people with symptoms is recommended, but not required in the U.S.\n\n\"From the perspective of an owner of a farm, I can understand to some extent some reluctance to test,\" Webby said. \"It is a disease that is not causing a lot of mortality on a farm. Any test right now can be associated, of course, with a quarantine period where cows can't move and the substantial economic hit that comes with it, even though I think there are some funds coming available to help with that. So you can understand from an economic perspective, reluctance to test cows.\n\n\"With the humans, there's probably some of that as well. ... It's a heavily sort of migrant population that works on the farms, perhaps with questionable documentation. The last thing that population wants to do is have anyone from any federal agency going out, and asking for any sort of name, phone numbers or addresses.\"\n\nBut until there is more widespread testing of animals and people, Webby said, it's difficult to answer a lot of the important questions that remain about this virus, such as: How is it moving around the farm? How long are cows infectious? What does it look like when cows get reinfected? Can they be reinfected?\n\n\"Without a lot more testing being done, we're a bit hamstrung in understanding exactly what's going on,\" he said.\n\nBird flu's financial impact on dairy farms is significant\n\nMichigan ranks in the top 10 nationally for dairy production. It is the biggest sector of the state's agricultural economy, with $15.7 billion in annual economic activity, of which $2.7 billion comes from milk alone, according to MDARD.\n\n\"Fifteen percent of a dairy herd tends to test positive for this on an affected farm and there's some corresponding drops in milk production,\" said MDARD Director Tim Boring during testimony Wednesday before a joint meeting of the state House and Senate natural resources and agriculture committees. \"Many cows never come back to full milk production. So we're building out an understanding of what the economic impact for a lot of farms is.\"\n\nThe USDA said 80% of farms with infected cattle reported abnormal lactation and less food intake; 90% of farms reported dairy cattle produced thickened or clotted milk.\n\nState Rep. Jerry Neyer, R-Shepherd, whose family owns a dairy farm, said a decline of 15% of milk production in a herd could financially devastate farmers.\n\n\"For whatever reason, this virus seems to focus in on the mammary system in dairy,\" he said. \"That's where it's noticed, in production. It doesn't seem to affect young livestock and non-milk production livestock cattle in the same way that affects the cow that's producing.\n\n\"When you go off production even by just 10%, that's your profit margin.\"\n\nAnd while there are losses in milk production to dairy farms, there also are increased costs for veterinary care for sick cows, for testing of animals and farmworkers, and costs to provide personal protective equipment to workers and test any who have symptoms. Some cows have lost pregnancies. Some have had to be put down.\n\nThen there are the additional downstream effects.\n\n\"There's a lot more time being spent tending to sick cows than doing things like planting corn or cutting silage or haylage in a timely fashion, and any number of additional aspects on farms that just aren't getting done,\" Boring said.\n\nFarms with infected cattle also are required to take biosecurity measures to help ensure that when people enter or leave, they don't bring the virus along with them on their clothing, vehicles or equipment. That means adding washing facilities. All of that costs money.\n\nTo soften the financial blow for affected Michigan dairy farms, Boring announced Wednesday that MDARD, in partnership with the USDA, will begin issuing $28,000 grants to 20 affected dairy cattle farms in the state.\n\n\"We know that the burden of working through questionnaires and having researchers on farms is significant,\" Boring said. \"So we're looking to take some initial steps here and we'll share details in the days to come ... around what that looks like.\"\n\nOutlook appears to be improving for poultry outbreaks\n\nMichigan's commercial egg and poultry farms, an $8.5 billion industry in the state, haven't escaped the avian influenza scourge, either.\n\nSince the first Michigan flocks were infected in 2022, the virus has hit domestic poultry farms and backyard flocks in 23 counties. This year alone, there've been outbreaks in eight flocks across four counties — Newaygo, Gratiot, Ottawa and Ionia.\n\nThe virus behaves differently in birds, killing as many as 90% of domestic poultry that become infected.\n\n\"It is a fatal disease in birds and the simplest way to get rid of it, unfortunately, is just killing them or putting them down,\" Neyer said. \"In the long run, it is the kindest thing you can do. Until we have some type of vaccine for it, there isn't much alternative to that.\"\n\nFarmers in Neyer's 92nd state House District, which includes portions of Gratiot and Isabella counties, have been hit hard, by the virus, he said, with multiple outbreaks on both poultry and dairy farms.\n\nHerbruck's Poultry Ranch, the largest egg producer in Michigan and the 10th largest in the United States, temporarily laid off 400 of its workers in May after an avian influenza outbreak struck its flock, forcing it to kill hens and destroy eggs.\n\nThe good news, Boring said, is that the pace of new H5N1 outbreaks among commercial and backyard poultry flocks has slowed in Michigan. May 9 was the last time the virus was detected in a backyard flock in Ionia County. The last outbreak on a commercial poultry operation in Michigan was May 2 in Gratiot County, according to MDARD.\n\nBecause the virus has been infecting poultry for two years, the USDA has had time to stand up \"really robust efforts in conjunction with state and industry partners ... for animal disease preparedness and response,\" Boring said. \"There's well-established procedures. There's well-established capacity within the system to be responding in real time ... based on response of the unique characteristics of how the disease manifests itself in poultry.\"\n\nThere also are financial supports in place to help commercial poultry operations weather the economic hit they take when their entire flocks are culled as a result of infection.\n\n\"It's going to be an evolving situation,\" Boring said. \"We're going to be seeing concerns on this, I think, for a bit here, and we're going to continue to really prioritize the work on the human health aspect for what those the potential (mutations) of the virus are. But I think that the piece to really focus on here is the fact that we've got effective food safety programs, human and animal safety programs. And the story here is the fact that the system is working as intended and protecting human and public health.\"\n\nEisenberg said she and others at U-M are also working to create their own wastewater surveillance system of H5 viruses to help inform the state health department at sites in Jackson, Ann Arbor, Tecumseh and Flint.\n\n\"I'm expecting we'll see positives for H5,\" she said.\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

New York City and 30 states now are seeing only minimal activity, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nFlu activity across the country has been at elevated\" levels for 15 consecutive weeks, the CDC reported Friday. A typical flu season lasts 13 weeks.\n\n\"Because this season started relatively early, it is expected to last longer,\" officials said.\n\nA flu virus that hits the elderly and young particularly hard and a vaccine that wasn't a good match for the dominant strain this year, known as H3N2, has been driving the deadly flu season. The vaccine was only 19% effective, compared to a \"good\" match that can prevent 60% to 65% of infections serious enough for people to see a doctor, health officials say.\n\n\"It was a fairly severe flu year, particularly for the elderly,\" said Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist with the CDC's influenza division.\n\nOverall flu hospitalization rates are at 53.5 per 100,000 people, but for those who are age 65 and older, the rate was 266.1 per 100,000, the highest recorded since the CDC first began tracking hospitalization rates for adults during the 2005-06 season, Brammer said.\n\nWhile statistics about elderly deaths from flu are not yet available, the CDC said this season's strain killed 97 kids across the USA.\n\n\"This is probably was the worst year we've had in the past three years,\" said Dr. Jim Kirk Jr., an infectious disease specialist at Mercy Hospital in Oklahoma City. \"What we saw is the same thing reflected across the country: The vaccine missed on the H3N2 component … and made the vaccine less effective than one would have liked.\"\n\nWhile the main flu season is winding down, Brammer said the CDC's surveillance is showing an uptick in a second type of flu virus — a different strain for which the vaccine does offer protection. As a result, people who haven't yet had the flu vaccine still could benefit.\n\n\"We're still seeing flu cases. It's less than it was, and fortunately the emergency rooms aren't full,\" said Dr. Steven Sperber, the chief of infectious disease division at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. \"The hospital is not as full with flu cases.\n\n\"It does seem the current season is winding down,\" he said. \"But it wouldn't be all that surprising … if there wasn't an increase with a second strain.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/health/childrens-hospitals-respiratory-illnesses-holiday", "title": "Amid a brutal season of RSV and flu infections, children's hospitals ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChildren’s hospitals are already full of sick kids and bracing for a potential increase in respiratory illnesses after holiday gatherings.\n\nAny respite that hospital emergency rooms have gotten from falling RSV levels has vanished in the face of climbing flu case counts.\n\n“Influenza activity is high and is driving a significant number of visits to our emergency department,” Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia spokesperson Ben Leach said. “We are seeing fewer hospitalizations related to the flu than we were related to RSV, but the rise in upper respiratory infections has led to increased wait times in emergency departments as well as our urgent care and primary care settings.”\n\nFor the past few months, pediatric hospital beds have consistently been about three-quarters full, federal data shows – straining capacity even more than average for the past few years of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe hospital units are nearly full on most days at Children’s Hospital Colorado, according to Associate Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kevin Carney.\n\n“While we certainly hope families and friends have an opportunity to gather and spend time together this holiday season, this is also a time where we often see spikes in viral infections. There is still plenty of RSV, COVID and influenza circulating and we encourage everyone to take precautions to keep themselves, their children and others healthy,” he said in a statement.\n\nAcross the country, flu activity remains high, and RSV hospitalizations are still higher than normal.\n\nBut there are some potential signs of relief. Flu hospitalizations improved last week, after the worst week of the season that hit post-Thanksgiving, and RSV has peaked in the US as test positivity rates and new hospitalization rates have slowed over the past month.\n\nThe Colorado Hospital Association said it is deactivating the Combined Hospital Transfer Center, a program that enabled overwhelmed pediatric hospitals to transfer young patients with Covid-19, RSV or flu to other hospitals, because cases have plateaued.\n\n“Colorado hospitals are prepared to employ our capacity management tools, including the CHTC, if we face another surge,” Jeff Tieman, the Colorado Hospital Association president and CEO, said in a statement.\n\nIn California, UC Davis Health spokesperson Edwin Garcia said that “overall numbers on viruses are high, but things are still manageable.”\n\nHealth care workers urge families to take precautions – like wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, washing their hands frequently and getting their flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster shots if they haven’t already – to prevent an influx of flu and Covid-19 cases over the next few weeks.\n\n“Sometimes, holidays do lead to sometimes a small, sometimes a modest spike in infections, with people gathering together indoors,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases and professor of pediatric infectious disease at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital Colorado.\n\nBut with RSV and flu circulating at high levels early in the season and well before the holidays, he said, “it’s a bit hard to predict what’s going to happen now that both of these may have peaked already.”\n\nPotential for secondary infections\n\nThere’s some concern too that viral infections like the flu can leave the body more vulnerable to secondary bacterial infections.\n\nO’Leary said he started noticing an increase in invasive group A strep infections in November. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it’s investigating an apparent increase in the infections too, but the rise may indicate a return to pre-pandemic levels, or it might reflect the high numbers of viral respiratory infections already this season.\n\n“You can get an invasive group A strep infection without having an underlying viral infection, but often they also happen as a complication of a viral infection,” O’Leary said.\n\nStrep A, or group A streptococcus, is a bacteria found in the throat and on the skin that usually causes fever and throat infections, such as strep throat or scarlet fever. Invasive group A strep infections are more rare and serious; they include necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, which can be deadly.\n\nStrep A is not fatal for most people who become infected, and antibiotics are usually effective at treating them.\n\nStruggles for families and health care workers\n\nHigh demand for over-the-counter children’s medicine and antibiotics is posing a challenge for families and health care workers alike.\n\n“Certainly, when you see a lot more sick kids, you’re going to see a lot more use of those medicines,” O’Leary said.\n\nSales of pediatric pain relievers are up 65% from this time last year, according to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association.\n\nThe demand has led pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens to limit purchases of children’s pain relief products.\n\nThe increase in illnesses, the shortage of medications, the hospitals teetering at the edge of capacity – all of this tells O’Leary that public health needs to be bolstered with more investment.\n\n“In a lot of ways, we aren’t prepared for big epidemics and pandemics because of the way our health system operates. And so that’s what we saw during the [Covid-19] pandemic. And further investment, of course, in public health is always something that’s a good idea, and we see that with emergencies, like the pandemic, but as you’ve probably seen, as the emergency abates, that funding dries up pretty quickly, and then we wait till the next time that something happens,” he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFor now, it’s all hands on deck for health care providers trying to get through a brutal respiratory virus season.\n\n“A lot of people are moonlighting where they otherwise wouldn’t, and that includes all staff and clinic physicians as well,” O’Leary said. “So people are really stepping up to the plate to meet the need right now, but yeah, we could certainly use a breather.”", "authors": ["Carma Hassan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2026/01/09/flu-levels-break-records-nationally-how-are-cases-in-brevard/88030981007/", "title": "Colds to COVID, how's Brevard doing as flu rates break national ...", "text": "Updated Jan. 9, 2026, 10:56 a.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary A winter surge of viruses, including a new flu variant, is causing a record number of outpatient cases across the U.S.\n\nFlorida's vaccination rates for both flu and COVID are lower than the national average for adults and children.\n\nWhile flu hospitalizations are increasing, COVID hospitalizations remain comparatively lower.\n\nThe holidays are over, the kids have headed back to school, you've returned to work and — uh-oh — the tell-tale signs of a sore throat start creeping up.\n\nIf you're feeling less than stellar as you kick off the new year, you're not alone: Around the United States, millions of people have been struck with the flu and COVID as the winter viral season surges, with the country breaking a record for the most outpatient cases involving respiratory virus since 1997, according to a report by NBC News.\n\nA new flu variant — subclade K, a mutation of influenza A H3N2 — is the main virus driving the wave of illnesses, according to the CDC. The virus is better at dodging immune systems that have built up immunity against more familiar strains, and this year's vaccine isn't as effective against it.\n\nAnd while COVID cases aren't causing as many hospitalizations as in years past, the risk for long-term problems like long COVID remain as the virus continues to follow its yearly pattern of peaking in the summer and winter.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health is behind on publishing data, with their most recent update regarding influenza data from Dec. 13. And while there is little tracking on a county-by-county level, doctors are seeing a variety of illnesses in Brevard, said Dr. Victor Vargas, chief medical officer at Health First Hospital Division.\n\n\"Like most regions across the country, Health First’s four hospitals in Brevard County are indeed experiencing a rise in visits for seasonal illnesses — including RSV, influenza, gastrointestinal viruses, colds and COVID,\" Vargas said.\n\n\"Patients who opt to visit a hospital emergency room can certainly expect lengthy delays as patients are triaged accordingly.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about the most recent data and how to protect yourself.\n\nFlu, COVID rates\n\nThroughout the United States, the flu test positivity rate was 25.5% as of the week ending on Dec. 27, according to the CDC, with influenza A being the most commonly reported influenza virus. In total, 8.3% of emergency department visits resulted in a diagnosis of influenza.\n\nNationally, the COVID test positivity rate was 3.9% as of the week ending Dec. 27, and 0.8% of emergency department visits resulted in a COVID diagnosis.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, the CDC estimated that flu infections were decreasing in Florida while COVID infections were increasing. However, during that time, they reported that the state was seeing a very high percentage of emergency department visits that resulted in a flu diagnosis, while emergency department visits that resulted in a COVID diagnosis were very low.\n\nData was not available for Brevard.\n\nFlu, COVID vaccine rates in Florida lower than nation\n\nAs of Dec. 13, about 42.2% of adults across the United States age 18 and older had been vaccinated against the flu, while about 42.3% of children ages 6 months to 17 years old had been vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nFlorida had lower rates of flu vaccination as of the same date: About 33.4% of adults had been immunized against the flu, and about 31.9% of children had received a flu vaccine.\n\nRates of COVID vaccination were significantly lower. Nationally, about 15.8% of adults 18 and older had been vaccinated against COVID for the 2025-2026 season as of Dec. 13, while about 7.5% of children 6 months to 17 years of age had received a COVID vaccination, according to the CDC.\n\nIn Florida, the percentage of those vaccinated against COVID was lower, with about 10.6% of adults immunized as of Dec. 13 and 1.3% of children immunized.\n\nLocal data was not available.\n\nHospitalizations, deaths\n\nHospitalizations for flu were increasing, according to the CDC, with 31.1 hospitalizations per 100,000 people during the week ending on Dec. 27. During that time, 0.9% of deaths were attributed to influenza, with one pediatric death, bringing the total of reported influenza-associated pediatric deaths for the 2025-2026 flu season to nine.\n\nThe recent rate of hospitalization for COVID has been lower than that of the flu, according to the CDC. During the week ending on Dec. 27, the rate of hospitalizations due to COVID per 100,000 was 0.8. Before Christmas, during the week ending on Dec. 13, the percentage of all deaths due to COVID was 0.4%.\n\nWhat about measles?\n\nOnce considered eliminated in the United States, measles surged across the country during 2025, hitting the highest level in more than 30 years. As of Dec. 30, a total of 2,065 measles cases had been recorded for the year, according to the CDC. 93% of the cases involved unvaccinated people or people with an unknown vaccination status, while 3% had received one MMR dose, and 4% had been fully vaccinated.\n\nIn Florida, there were seven measles cases in 2025, according to the CDC. The previous year, there were 11 cases.\n\nIn Brevard, the cases \"remain uncommon locally,\" Vargas said.\n\n\"Health First encourages the community to stay informed rather than alarmed,\" he said, adding that symptoms can include fever, cough, runny nose, eye redness and a rash that typically begins on the face and spreads.\n\nIf you suspect you have the virus, let your care team know before visiting the hospital or a doctor's office, he said.\n\n\"By calling ahead, individuals can help ensure the right precautions are in place, while allowing care teams to continue protecting others in our facilities.\"\n\nNationally, there were three confirmed deaths from measles in 2025, and 11% of cases resulted in hospitalizations, mostly in children under five years of age.\n\nThe disease can cause complications ranging from earn infections to pneumonia to encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, to long-term issues like subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare but fatal disease of the central nervous system. Children under the age of five, adults older than 20, pregnant people and immunocompromised people are most at risk.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, is 97% effective at preventing measles and is generally given to kids as part of the regular vaccine course at ages 12 to 15 months for the first dose and ages 4 to 6 for the second dose.\n\nLast year, amid measles outbreaks around the country, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called into question the effectiveness of the measles vaccine, saying its protection wanes at a rate of about 5% a year despite evidence that most people are protected against the disease for life after receiving two doses of the vaccine. Kennedy has also pushed debunked claims that the vaccine is linked to autism.\n\nWays to protect yourself\n\nThe flu, COVID, measles and other viruses like the common cold can spread through the air when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. You can also pick up viruses by touching contaminated surfaces.\n\nThe CDC recommends the following measures to help protect yourself and others:\n\nStay up to date on your vaccines.\n\nWash your hands often, use hand sanitizer and regularly clean high-touch surfaces.\n\nBring fresh air into your home or work space by opening windows, using a HEPA air filter or setting the fan on your HVAC system to \"on\" when visitors are over; or move activities outdoors.\n\nWear a high-quality mask, such as an N95, especially in crowded spaces.\n\nTake an at-home test if you're feeling unwell or know you've been exposed to someone with COVID or the flu, and avoid spending time with people who are sick.\n\nIf you do end up catching a virus, limit contact with other people to avoid spreading your illness. If you're sick with the flu or COVID, reach out to a health care provider to see if you can get antiviral drugs, which can make your symptoms milder and shorten the duration of your illness.\n\nThere are numerous ways to access care, Vargas said. Unless you're experiencing a medical emergency, he suggests avoiding the emergency room.\n\n\"In most cases, especially here in Brevard County, there are a wealth of services from Virtual Visits to urgent care facilities, that are faster, more convenient and will have you on the road to recovery without long wait times in an emergency room where more serious injuries and medical emergencies take priority,\" he said.\n\nFinch Walker is the education reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

They haven’t been all that attentive to flu. They’re not wearing masks,” Schaffner said. “And if you’re close together with other people, it’s an opportunity for all three of these viruses – flu, Covid, and even RSV – to spread from one person to another. So, we do expect a post-holiday surge in these viruses.”\n\nAt the same time, across the country, there has been a wave of flight cancellations and families stuck at the airport during their holiday travels.\n\nWhen that happens, “People are together for very long periods of time, and they’re not wearing masks, and they’re weary and tired and stressed, and those are occasions where people are more apt to spread the virus,” Schaffner said, adding that his own granddaughter had four flights canceled over the holidays. He recommends masking up while in the airport and on an airplane.\n\n“I think all of us in infectious diseases and public health would recommend that masks are not perfect, but they are an additional layer of protection,” Schaffner said.\n\nSome local health officials are bracing for a possible surge in respiratory illnesses following the winter holidays since that was seen recently following Thanksgiving, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said in an email to CNN on Monday.\n\n“After the Thanksgiving holiday period, we saw an uptick in COVID cases by about 58% through the beginning of the Christmas holiday on December 21,” Freeman wrote. “Deaths from COVID also rose during that same time period by about 65%.”\n\nFlu also surged after Thanksgiving, with more than a third of all flu hospitalizations and deaths at the time this season being reported in the first full week of data post-Thanksgiving, and cases also jumped nearly as much.\n\nCurrently, seasonal flu activity remains high in the US, but continues to decline in most parts of the country, according to data published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite improvements, flu may not have peaked yet.\n\nCDC estimates that, so far this season, there have been at least 18 million illnesses, 190,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths from flu.\n\nAs for the current state of Covid-19, increases appear to be relatively mild. Hospitalizations are ticking up in most states, although the overall rate is still just a fraction of what it was during other surges. New hospital admissions have jumped nearly 50% over the past month. Hospitalizations among seniors are nearing the peak from the Delta surge – and rising fast.\n\nFreeman said it is expected that reports after the winter holidays will continue to show increases in Covid-19 cases and deaths, likely attributable to increased travel across the country, large family gatherings, fewer people being up to date on their Covid-19 vaccinations and flu shots, and fewer people following mitigation measures, such as masking and social distancing.\n\n“Air travel is also back to pre-pandemic levels and there are no more restrictions on mask wearing on airplanes or in airports where viruses can easily circulate. Same for bussing,” Freeman said. “Fortunately, we are seeing less RSV in children from our high points earlier in December, so that respiratory illness is stabilizing and becoming less of a part of the triple threat of COVID, flu, and RSV.”\n\nAs health officials brace for a possible surge in respiratory viruses in the coming weeks, it might not be just flu, Covid-19 and RSV that sickens people, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\n\n“We’re focusing on those three, but there are others out there – the common cold and others,” Benjamin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverall, “we should expect more respiratory diseases,” he said. “The best way to reduce your risk is of course to get fully vaccinated for those that which we have a vaccine, so influenza and Covid, with the new bivalent version, are the two most important right now.”\n\nBenjamin added that it also remains important to wash your hands often, wear a mask during holiday travels and stay home when sick.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/01/09/cdc-says-respiratory-illnesses-very-high-in-florida-spiking-in-swfl/77507077007/", "title": "CDC says respiratory illnesses 'very high' in Florida, spiking in SWFL", "text": "Jan. 9, 2025 Updated Jan. 10, 2025, 10:45 a.m. ET\n\nIt’s the busy winter season and that means respiratory illnesses are going up in Southwest Florida.\n\nHospital leaders expect case volume of flu, the common cold, and respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, to keep climbing.\n\nStatewide respiratory illnesses are labeled as “very high,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLab testing shows a nearly 19% increase in flu around the U.S. and about 26,000 people were hospitalized due to flu.\n\nWhile flu is not a reportable disease to the state Department of Health, the state agency monitors flu activity and say it is increasing in Southwest Florida, in the densely populated South Florida area and the northern half of the state.\n\nAround 8% of emergency room visits are tied to flu.\n\nIn the first week of January, the CDC said the level of RSV causing people to seek healthcare is at a “high level” and increasing nationally. COVID-19 activity is ticking up in most areas of the country.\n\nWhat do Southwest Florida hospitals say?\n\nAt Lee Health, the nonprofit hospital system in Lee County, the volume of respiratory illnesses was three times higher the last week of December compared to the same time in 2023.\n\nThe first week of December, the health system saw 697 cases of flu, which jumped 82% to 1,273 cases the week of Dec. 22, according to Lee Health data. The last week of December saw a slight dip to 1,129 cases of flu.\n\nIn terms of emergency room visits, the total number of flu-related visits Jan. 7 stood at 951 compared to 991 this same time last year.\n\nDr. Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, Lee Health’s chief medical officer, said: “Our emergency departments are seeing seasonal increases as expected for the time of year and annual increase of residents.

Cases are rising in multiple US regions, with some already nearing seasonal peak levels, according to the latest real-time surveillance data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSurveillance data collected by the CDC clearly shows a rise in RSV cases nationwide in recent weeks, with cases detected by PCR tests more than tripling over the past two months and nearing last year’s peaks. The CDC’s surveillance program captures data from 75 counties representing about 9% of the total US population.\n\n“RSV admissions have skyrocketed at Connecticut Children’s. October has been like never before for this virus,” Monica M. Buchanan, senior director of strategic and enterprise communications for Connecticut Children’s Hospital, told CNN.\n\nBuchanan said hospital leaders have met with the Connecticut Department of Public Health and the National Guard to begin logistic review of putting a mobile field hospital in the front lawn and more work is planned Thursday to determine a final decision and get approval.\n\nDr. Juan Salazar, executive vice president and physician-in-chief at Connecticut Children’s, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan that beds are filled to capacity and children are coming to the hospital at an “unprecedented” level: More than 100 with respiratory syncytial virus over the last 10 days, including many who require intensive care and oxygen therapy.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for a long time, I’ve been at Connecticut Children’s for 25 years, and I have never seen this level of surge – specifically of RSV – coming into our hospital,” he said.\n\nSalazar said the hospital hasn’t yet expanded to a field tent, “but we have to be prepared in case the numbers continue to increase. So if RSV increases further and it hits us with influenza at the tail end of this … we will need additional capacity for our hospital.”\n\nThe rise in cases is also coming earlier in the year than doctors would usually expect.\n\n“We used to have kind of a seasonality to different viruses,” Dr. Thomas Murray, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and associate professor at Yale University School of Medicine, told CNN affiliate WFSB. “Like the one right now, respiratory syncytial virus or RSV would come in December, it would go away followed by influenza, it would go away and another one. What seemed to happen with Covid is that now they’re all circulating at the same time.”\n\nIn most of the United States, RSV typically circulates during fall, winter and spring, but the timing and severity of RSV season in a given community can vary from year to year.\n\nIn 2021, RSV peaked during the summer, so this year’s fall and winter surge marks a return to circulation patterns seen in pre-pandemic years, according to statement from CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund.\n\nThis shift comes as other respiratory viruses – the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and flu – drive more concern, too.\n\nSalazar said the United States is coming out of the Covid era, when children had relatively little exposure to viruses – and it’s hitting them now.\n\n“I think for the next four to eight week, we just have to be careful,” Salazar said, adding that getting vaccinated against influenza now could help curb months of surging flu cases later.\n\n“Get your kids vaccinated for influenza,” he said. “This is the time you need to do it.”\n\nThe CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get a flu vaccine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAn early increase in seasonal flu activity has been reported in most of the United States, with the nation’s Southeast and south-central areas reporting the highest levels of flu, according to the CDC.\n\n“Here we are in the middle of October – not the middle of November – we’re already seeing scattered influenza cases, even hospitalized influenza cases, around the country,” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told CNN.", "authors": ["Chris Boyette Jamie Gumbrecht", "Chris Boyette", "Jamie Gumbrecht"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/06/03/michigan-cow-herds-infected-bird-flu/73955332007/", "title": "Michigan has most cow herds, people infected with bird flu in US", "text": "Kristen Jordan Shamus\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nJune 3, 2024, 12:57 p.m. ET\n\nMichigan has become ground zero for the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus that's sweeping the nation, killing turkeys, chickens and wild birds, infecting cows and other mammals – and now has sickened a third U.S. farmworker.\n\nThe Great Lakes state has more dairy cattle herds known to be infected with avian influenza than any other state in the U.S., with 24 outbreaks in 10 counties as of Friday, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It now also has two farmworkers with confirmed bird flu infections – transmitted to them by close contact with sick cows.\n\nTexas is the only other state where a person is known to have contracted the H5N1 virus from a cow, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That state has reported 15 cattle herd infections since March. Seven other states – Idaho, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and North Carolina – also have cow herds with known infections, the USDA reported.\n\nThe reason Michigan's tally of livestock outbreaks and farmworkers with avian influenza is higher than other states is not because Michigan is especially ripe for viral activity or because there's something different about the state's cows or workers, said Dr. Arnold Monto, emeritus professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan and co-director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response.\n\n\"The main reason we're detecting more infection is because we're doing very good surveillance,\" Monto said. \"Other states need to do the same. ... It's being missed.\"\n\nThe CDC reported May 22 that 40 people had been tested for highly pathogenic avian influenza nationally. The same day, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical officer, told the Free Press that 35 Michigan farmworkers had undergone testing.\n\nThat means only five people tested as of May 22 were from states other than Michigan. It also means the reach of the virus \"is certainly more widespread\" nationally than anyone currently knows, Monto said.\n\n\"The conclusions are pretty obvious when you hear things like that,\" said Monto. \"If you don't look, you're not going to find it. What we need is to get serious about it in terms of how we handle surveillance because if you don't know it's there and don't have regulations in place ... it's going to spread even more.\"\n\nThe CDC updated its testing and monitoring data Friday, saying 44 people have now been tested nationally for the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, and more than 390 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals.\n\nThe agency said it is also stepping up national surveillance/testing by:\n\nAsking local labs to send more samples for subtyping to the CDC and state public health labs to test for the H5N1 virus.\n\nExtending reporting of flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network. The CDC typically stops reporting influenza hospitalizations from May-September because it’s ordinarily such a seasonal virus. So far, the CDC said its surveillance systems show no indication of unusual flu activity in people.\n\nIncreasing outreach through state and local health departments to health care providers and clinics about H5N1 symptoms so avian influenza is considered when patients with conjunctivitis or respiratory illness and a history of exposure to animals seek medical care.\n\nHow the virus came to Michigan cow herds\n\nThe outbreak of H5N1 virus in dairy cattle – with spillover to humans – began in Texas just a few months ago. It came to Michigan in late March, when infected cows crossed state lines, said Tim Boring, the director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\n\"We know that a farm in Montcalm County initially (had an outbreak) as a result of cattle movement,\" Boring said, \"and we've seen an expansion of our cases out of that general area since then.\"\n\nCalling the H5N1 outbreak among poultry and cattle in Michigan an \"extraordinary emergency,\" Boring issued an order May 1 that required all dairy and commercial poultry farms in Michigan to adopt biosecurity practices to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nAmong the requirements: Farms must secure animal areas, establish a perimeter and limit access. They must name a biosecurity manager and train employees, and establish cleaning and disinfection practices for all with contact within the perimeter, including delivery drivers. They must keep log books tracking all who enter and leave.\n\nThe order also prohibited all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last two months of pregnancy, from being exhibited at fairs and festivals until there are no new cases of the virus statewide in dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days. Similarly, poultry also cannot be taken to exhibitions, fairs or festivals until no new cases of the virus have been detected in domestic poultry for at least 30 consecutive days.\n\nThe state agriculture department also teamed up closely with state and local health departments to ensure people would be protected, Boring said.\n\n\"In Michigan, we're testing in animals and we're testing in people and we've seen really strong coordination between animal and human health components within the state level, the federal level and on the local level,\" he told the Free Press on Friday. \"Part of the reason that we've seen good responses on testing is because of the involvement of local health departments. Those are trusted community partners. They are neighbors, not folks coming in from out of town. We're taking this really seriously. It's a proactive approach. This is both an animal and a public health concern, and we're managing it as such.\"\n\nStill, Boring said, there are many unanswered questions about this virus, including how it spreads.\n\n\"We likely have a multifactorial transmission matrix going on of how the virus spreads from dairy farm to dairy farm. ... We're getting a better handle on it every day, and we're continuing to lead across the country of what the response looks like.\"\n\nHuman cases so far have been mild\n\nAll three people known to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S. this year have had mild symptoms.\n\nThe Texas farmworker and the first person in Michigan to get ill from exposure to infected cattle reported only conjunctivitis, or pink eye. In the second Michigan case, which was announced Thursday, a farmworker had upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, the CDC reported.\n\nThere is concern among scientists that the impact on people could change, as more animals get infected.\n\nThe more the virus spreads in animals, the greater the likelihood of human exposures and transmission, Monto said, which also increases the odds that the virus could mutate in a way that would allow H5N1 to spread from person to person or cause more severe disease.\n\n\"That's why we really need to control it – not because we're sure that is going to happen, but because if that does happen, there's a chance it's going to be pretty bad,\" Monto said.\n\nThe CDC is conducting genetic sequencing on the most recent human case in Michigan to determine what, if any changes, there might be.\n\nAll three known human cases so far involved the 2.3.4.4b lineage of the virus that is nearly identical to the H5N1 viruses circulating in U.S. dairy cows, the CDC reported.\n\nIn samples taken from the infected eye of the first Michigan farmworker, whose case was announced May 22, the CDC identified a mutation that allows mammals to be infected more easily. However, it did not contain changes that would likely make it easier for the virus to spread from human to human.\n\nAnd that's key, Monto said.\n\n\"We're lucky that there are receptor-binding issues that are preventing it from getting into humans easily,\" Monto said, \"because if it were easy to transmit, with all of the workers that are on these farms handling the equipment, which is heavily contaminated, we would see more cases.\"\n\nThe virus affects animals, people differently\n\nThe impact of the virus on animals so far has been extremely variable, said Timothy Cernak, an assistant professor of chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"The virus behaves different in each species,\" said Cernak, whose work centers on developing new antiviral drugs that could be added to the arsenal of current antivirals to help stop a potential avian flu outbreak. \"There are species that it gets into and they just don't seem to notice,\" while others get very sick and others see mass die-offs.\n\nThe current H5N1 strain in the U.S. is extremely deadly in birds and cats, sea lions, raccoons and skunks.\n\nDairy cows get sick from the virus but don't typically die. A report from Michigan State University suggests cows on one Michigan farm with an H5N1 outbreak had high fevers and dehydration. There was a drop in rumination as well, which turns the grass they eat into energy and milk. Milk production dropped dramatically, and some pregnant cows miscarried.\n\nLast week, the USDA reported that alpacas in Idaho also have contracted the virus. And mice became sick within a day of drinking raw milk from an infected cow. The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from researchers at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory that showed the mice had high levels of virus in their organs. Levels also were high in the mammary glands of two mice – even though the mice were not lactating.\n\n\"In elephant seals it killed 96% of the pups from last year,\" Cernak said, adding that the virus also devastated the bald eagle population and affected horned owls. \"It's entirely possible in wild populations, there are significant risks of extinction-level events happening.\"\n\nFor humans, he said a different subtype of H5N1 avian influenza that spread in Cambodia from 2003 to 2023 caused severe illness and deaths.\n\n\"In Cambodia, the fatality rate in humans was really high, and that's the concerning thing,\" Cernak said. Of 64 people who contracted the other subtype of the virus, 41 died, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nCould respiratory symptoms signal easier human-to-human spread?\n\nFor now, as the bird flu circulating in the U.S. has remained mild in the few human cases, Cernak said he is concerned about the potential for respiratory transmission to give this virus a boost.\n\n\"The biggest risk that we have is that it mutates toward respiratory transmission,\" he told the Free Press last week — before the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced that the state does now, in fact, have a farmworker with H5 infection and respiratory symptoms.\n\nIt's unclear, however, whether having those symptoms will make it easier to spread the virus from person to person.\n\nJoe Coyle, deputy state epidemiologist and director of the MDHHS Bureau of Infectious Disease, said it's the first time respiratory symptoms have been associated with a human H5N1 influenza case following contact with sick cows.\n\n\"Generally speaking, with something like influenza and respiratory viruses, when you have respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to spread the virus than if it was just conjunctivitis like the previous case we had in Michigan and the one in Texas,\" Coyle said.\n\n\"It is a new presentation, and it's something that we'll definitely be looking at ... to see if this represents a different mutation of the virus that's causing these types of symptoms, or is it really the same virus but just a different route of transmission with respect to the human exposure.\"\n\nThe CDC reported that the farmworker with respiratory symptoms was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, and is isolating at home. None of the person's contacts have developed symptoms and all are being monitored and offered antiviral medication.\n\nMore outreach to farms needed\n\nDr. Adam Lauring, an associate professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at U-M, said there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to the current U.S. H5N1 avian influenza outbreak.\n\n\"Often in the health field, we are maybe appropriately focused on the humans, but the wider the outbreak is in animals, the more risk there is of humans being infected because there are more potential contacts,\" he said.\n\n\"I think everyone's trying to understand different ways that it could be spreading among dairy cattle within a herd and also between herds or between farms, and I think that's an important thing that we need to really get a better understanding of.\n\n\"In terms of how far it has spread in humans, that is dependent on really being able to do good surveillance, which is challenging in this situation in that it depends on people coming to attention, reporting their symptoms, getting tested.\"\n\nMany farmworkers are undocumented migrant workers for whom English might not be a first language and who might be concerned about being deported if they say they are sick or seek medical care.\n\n\"A lot of these populations are hard to reach,\" Lauring said. \"I know MDHHS has been doing outreach to try to do as best they can with surveillance for symptoms in people to try to catch anyone who could be infected, and also then to offer testing. That's how, for example, this (first) case in Michigan was identified was through this program.\"\n\nMichigan, he said, appears to have done a better job than many other states. It has created a daily text-message surveillance system, available in English and in Spanish, that asks workers to detail whether they have symptoms. Anyone who answers yes is then offered testing by local public health workers.\n\nTesting is encouraged, but not required, and the federal government now is reimbursing farms for some of the losses they have incurred from H5N1 outbreaks and testing.\n\n\"This is an ongoing, evolving situation and it's important to pay attention to that,\" Lauring said. \"Fortunately, the risk to the general population is low, but we need to pay attention and reach out to farms and people working with the farms and work together to control the outbreak.\"\n\n'We're flying blind'\n\nKatelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and consultant for several health organizations including the CDC, wrote on a post on her substack, \"Your Local Epidemiologist,\" that the H5N1 situation in the U.S. is far from controlled.\n\n\"We are flying blind,\" she said. \"We don’t know how this virus is spreading, where it is spreading, and if it’s becoming better at infecting humans.\"\n\nLack of trust in public health in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, farmworkers' fears of deportation and language barriers, along with farmers' concerns about the financial impact the H5N1 outbreaks all are affecting surveillance efforts.\n\n\"It shouldn’t be shocking that few are volunteering to test for H5N1,\" she wrote.\n\nAnimal testing for avian influenza viruses in Michigan is done through MSU's Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Positive results are sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for confirmatory testing, Boring said.\n\nIf an animal's test result is positive, \"we work closely with local and state health officials to make sure that local health is on farms, working with farmworkers, apprising them of everything they need to know about what this virus means and maintaining and tracking some human safety aspects there,\" he said.\n\nThat includes ensuring personal protective gear – such as face shields or goggles, respirator masks, rubber coveralls and boots – are available to workers on farms with infected animals. Although wearing PPE is recommended, it isn't mandatory.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to assist those human health partners to be getting equipment out to not only just farms, but within those CDC guidelines around processing plants as well.\n\n\"We've had a few farms take us up on that, but the base PPE that makes so much of a difference in these cases – eye protection, gloves – that is equipment a lot of farms have on hand already.\"\n\nNeither of the Michigan farmworkers who were infected by cows wore fully protective equipment, said Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, in a statement issued Thursday. One was splashed in the eye with milk from an infected cow and the other had \"direct exposure to an infected cow.\"\n\n\"This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms,\" she said.\n\nFor protection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recommends that anyone who is within 6 feet of an infected cow should wear:\n\nSafety goggles or a face shield\n\nDisposable gloves\n\nBoots or boot covers\n\nA respirator, such as an N95 mask\n\nFluid-resistant coveralls\n\nHead covering\n\nMany questions about avian influenza remain unanswered\n\nThere remain many questions with wide implications, Monto said, when it comes to how this virus is behaving.\n\nAmong them, he said: For how long is a cow infectious? Will infections be sustained on farms or will they be able to be rid of the virus over time? Why are lactating cows so susceptible and why are virus particles so concentrated in their milk?\n\n\"What is going on in the mixed dairy-beef cattle farms? A cow is a cow,\" said Monto.\n\nHe noted that in one out of 109 samples of beef tested in late May by the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, H5N1 viral particles were detected in muscle tissue. In ground beef that was inoculated with high levels of virus, cooking it to at least 145 degrees (medium) or 160 degrees (well done) killed the H5N1 virus.\n\n\"Even cooking burgers to 120 (rare) degrees, which is well below the recommended temperature, substantially inactivated the virus,\" the USDA reported.\n\nAnd though similar testing of commercial milk found H5N1 viral fragments, those particles were inactivated by pasteurization and were unable to cause infection. Raw milk from infected cows, however, has been shown to be a risk for infection.\n\n\"We do know that raw milk is full of the virus,\" Monto said. \"We know that we shouldn't be drinking unpasteurized milk and some people are (obsessed with) drinking unpasteurized milk.\"\n\nMonto said scientists still don't know whether the milk of other animals – or humans – is infectious when they contract avian influenza.\n\n\"This virus is now spreading wherever they shipped dairy cows. It's come all the way from Texas to Michigan. And it's come to a variety of other states,\" Monto said.\n\n\"We need to control the infection in cattle, and that will lower the probability of humans becoming infected.\"\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Compounding the problem, this year's flu vaccine doesn't protect well against the specific variation of that type of virus.\n\nFlu vaccines are only 23% effective this season, health officials said Thursday. Flu shots normally prevent 60% to 65% of infections serious enough for people to see a doctor.\n\nUpdated data about hospitalizations and flu deaths were released Friday, and the CDC says this season so far is worse than last season and very similar to the 2012-13 season. Forty-six states are reporting \"widespread\" flu, and the four remaining — Alaska, Alabama, Georgia and Hawaii — are reporting at least some flu cases.\n\nIn Michigan, flu patients are clogging ERs, and at least five people have died. In Maryland, some hospital workers report hospitalization levels double those of last year. And in Arizona, doctors say peak flu season may not yet have arrived, and worry about visitors from across the world streaming in for the Feb. 1 Super Bowl.\n\n\"I think we're right in the meat of the season right now,\" said Dr. Joe Bresee, chief of the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in CDC's Influenza Division. \"You never know with flu. It's unpredictable, but I think we're in the peak period right now.\"\n\nThe flu kills tens of thousands of Americans annually, something that Bresee has in the forefront of his mind after spending the summer in Africa helping fight Ebola. \"I think it is easy to forget ... that flu can be a severe disease,\" he said.\n\nIn Maryland, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reports intensity levels of reported flu-like symptoms rose from \"minimal\" to \"high\" in about a month, with the elderly bearing the brunt. At Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, Md., they've had 130 positive tests, up from 80 last season, said spokesman Roger Follebout. Of those 130 cases, 38 cases have been for patients age 65 or older. Sixty-seven cases were for people under age 25, he said.\n\nIn Brevard County, Fla., MedFast Urgent Care Centers' physicians are seeing about 30% more patients who are complaining of flu-like symptoms than last year, said David T. Williams, the chief medical officer. At least two county residents have died.\n\nIowa has been among the hardest hit states. At least 32 care centers have seen flu outbreaks this winter, and some of those have included deaths, said Dr. Patricia Quinlisk, the state's top infectious-disease expert. According to the state health department, 64% of Iowans hospitalized for flu complications this winter have been 65 or older.\n\nStaff members, residents and their families were stunned at how quickly the virus spread once it got into the Bishop Drumm Retirement Center in Johnston, Iowa, in mid-December. Two residents died from flu complications.\n\nIn New Jersey, the spike in flu at long-term care facilities mirrored the flu activity for the state overall, where four of the five regions were seeing high flu activity, and some emergency rooms last week were diverting patients because cases of the flu and similar respiratory illnesses had them at capacity. That influx has since subsided, said Kerry McKean Kelly, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Hospital Association.\n\nMedical staff at Seabrook, a 1,400-person retirement community in Tinton Falls, N.J., vaccinated 95% of its residents in September with a new high-dose flu vaccine. Developed by Sanofi Pasteur, the high-dose vaccine is supposed to provide better protection for people 65 and older, an age group at greater risk for complications from the flu.\n\nAt Seabrook Medical Center, which is on-site, director Dr. Dimitri Cefalu said the community's staff have been stepping up their efforts to prevent the flu. They are cleaning common areas more frequently, encouraging frequent hand washing among staff and residents and making sure they have plenty of hand sanitizers, gloves, masks and gowns.\n\nArlene and Bill Fritz, both 84, of Tinton Falls, said they would be concerned about the flu if they hadn't already gotten their flu shots. But even still, they are taking precautions to avoid the illness.\n\nArlene Fritz said she and her husband use hand sanitizer stations after church service, where some fellow parishioners have dropped handshake greetings in favor of fist bumps or nothing at all.\n\n\"I wash my hands a lot more,\" she said. \"As soon as I get back to my room, after pushing all of the elevator buttons and everything.\"\n\nArizona officials also are bracing for an increase in cases as the state prepares for Super Bowl XLIX, the Phoenix Open golf tournament and other major events in coming weeks.\n\nThe state Department of Health Services reported more than 1,500 cases since flu season began Sept. 28, spread over 13 counties. Jessica Rigler, chief of the Bureau of Epidemiology and Disease Control, said the numbers are roughly on track with the last couple years, and do not compare with the epidemic that has hit some East Coast communities.\n\nRigler stressed that visitors from flu-heavy states already have poured into Arizona for sports events, and their numbers will peak around Jan. 31. She urged Arizonans to get preventive shots, noting that the vaccine takes two weeks to become effective.\n\n\"We know we're going to have a huge influx of visitors,\" she said, \"and many of them will bring the flu. So now's the time to get vaccinated.\"\n\nBresee said the trouble with this year's flu vaccine stems from a genetic variation in the strains it covers. The vaccine's recipe is developed in the spring each year, with health officials doing their best to predict which strains will be circulating come fall. This season's vaccine isn't a good match for the strains in circulation, he said.\n\n\"In years that we've seen these differences develop, we see lower than expected success,\" he said.\n\nStill, CDC officials recommend a flu shot for everyone older than 6 months because even partial protection is better than nothing. All flu shots are designed to protect against three viruses. This year's flu shots also protect against H1N1, which caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009-2010. Manufacturers have distributed 150 million doses.\n\nThe CDC is also pushing doctors to more aggressively use antiviral medications such as Tamiflu, which can reduce the severity of flu symptoms.\n\nContributing: Robin Erb, Detroit Free Press; John Wisely, Detroit Free Press; Dennis Wagner, Arizona Republic; Brian Shane, The (Salisbury, Md.)

Will Trump use military action?", "text": "Updated Jan. 7, 2026, 4:11 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON — The Trump administration says it's actively discussing what a potential purchase of Greenland from Denmark would look like but isn't ruling out U.S. military action if diplomacy fails.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Capitol Hill after a classified briefing with senators, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he'd be meeting with Denmark next week and stressed that as the nation's chief diplomat he does not prefer using military might to achieve the United States' national security objectives.\n\nBut, he said, \"If the president identifies a threat to the national security of the United States, every president retains the option to address it through military means.\"\n\nRubio reportedly told lawmakers during a classified briefing earlier in the week that the U.S. is aiming to buy Greenland rather than invade the Danish territory that's located in the Arctic and has some 56,000 inhabitants. Denmark is a NATO member nation and a U.S. military ally. It has repeatedly said Greenland is not for sale and requested a meeting with Rubio this week after the White House affirmed that it was discussing a range of options to acquire the autonomously-governed island - and military action was one of them.\n\nAfter a separate briefing with senators on Jan. 7, Rubio said he simply reminded lawmakers that Trump isn't the first U.S. president who's tried to buy Greenland, bringing up Harry Truman's rejected offer in 1946, and that Trump has been talking about acquiring Greenland since his first term.\n\n\"As a diplomat, which is what I am now, and what we work on, we always prefer to settle it in different ways - that included in Venezuela,\" Rubio said after he was asked if Trump was willing to risk the NATO alliance with potential military action in Greenland. \"We tried repeatedly to reach an outcome here that did not involve having to go in and grab and indict a drug trafficker. Those were unsuccessful unfortunately.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt could not offer details on what a potential offer would like during a briefing for reporters shortly after Rubio made the remarks.\n\n\"That's something that's currently being actively discussed by the president and his national security team,\" Leavitt said.\n\nLeavitt also emphasized that the acquisition is not a new idea. \"The president has been very open and clear with all of you and with the world that he views it in the best interest of the United States to deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\" she said.\n\n\"That's why his team is currently talking about what a potential purchase would look like,\" Leavitt added.\n\nLeavitt cast the Trump administration's ambiguity on military action as part of a strategy meant to confound America's enemies and allies. \"All options are always on the table for President Trump, as he examines what's in the best interest of the United States. But I will just say, the president's first option always has been diplomacy,\" she said, echoing Rubio.\n\nBut she too offered Venezuela, and the administration's strike last summer on nuclear facilities in Iran, as instances in which Trump sought to forge deals with foreign governments and warned the nations, publicly and privately, before he reverted to military action.\n\nTrump has raised the prospect of the U.S. acquiring Greenland since his first White House term. However, remarks that he and other U.S. officials have made about the strategic importance of the territory since the surprise attack on Venezuela have renewed concern that the U.S. could try to take the island through military force.\n\nTrump indicated to reporters on Jan. 4 that his focus is on Venezuela at the moment. But he also criticized Denmark and said, “We need Greenland from a national security situation. It’s so strategic.”\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged the U.S. \"to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale\" in a Jan. 4 statement rebutting Trump.\n\n\"The Kingdom of Denmark - and thus Greenland - is part of NATO and is therefore covered by the alliance's security guarantee. We already have a defense agreement between the Kingdom and the United States today, which gives the United States wide access to Greenland. And we, on the part of the Kingdom, have invested significantly in security in the Arctic,\" Frederiksen said.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on Jan. 5, Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, questioned Denmark's right to assert control over Greenland and the basis of its territorial claim.\n\n\"The United States is the power of NATO, for the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests. Obviously, Greenland should be part of the United States,\" Miller said.\n\nGreenland should be part of the United States, Miller added, while suggesting that Denmark wouldn't engage in military action against the United States if tried to take control of the island.\n\n\"There's no need to even think or talk about this in the context that you're asking of a military operation,\" Miller said. \"Nobody's going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/10/21/trump-white-house-demolition-east-wing-ballroom/86817272007/", "title": "I'm glad Trump is demolishing the White House to build a ballroom ...", "text": "Oct. 21, 2025, 2:45 p.m. ET\n\nWhen I saw images of the East Wing of the White House being demolished to make way for President Donald Trump’s big, beautiful ballroom, I could barely contain myself.\n\nIt’s happening, I thought. The president is finally acting on the one issue that matters: BALLROOM!\n\nAll my life, I’ve been a single-issue voter, and that issue has been to find a president with the courage and good taste to rip apart some of the uggo White House and attach a 90,000-square-foot, gold-forward, glass-walled ballroom that overshadows the so-called People’s House.\n\nImages of the White House being demolished for a ballroom? Huzzah!\n\nWell, on Oct. 20, as construction workers used massive machines to violently demolish the East Wing facade, I finally felt seen. It was everything I had ever dreamed of, and more, like something out of a fairy tale: A historically ballroom-less building, long a central symbol of American democracy, was being torn asunder by a failed casino owner who previously promised the new construction would not impact the White House.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n“It’ll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of,” Trump said in July.\n\nHah! Excellent dissembling, sir. Every great ballroom begins with a fantastic lie!\n\nHistorians, critics oppose Trump's ballroom, but what do they know of grandeur?\n\nBallroom-averse critics are predictably hollering about the construction.\n\nRobert Sutton, a former chief historian of the National Park Service, which stewards the White House and surrounding property, told the BBC that the agency has not reviewed the ballroom plans or vetted the architect.\n\n“This building is so important,” Sutton said. “It's considered, I think, to be the most important executive building in the world – yet we just don't know what's happening, and I think that's very inappropriate.”\n\nBooooooo! What’s happening is America is getting a marvelous new ballroom, and that’s all that matters.\n\nCosts are going up, and funding is murky. A perfect ballroom backstory!\n\nThe project is off to a perfect start, with The Washington Post reporting that “Trump originally estimated the project would cost $200 million to build but has since upped that to $250 million.” (All good ballrooms have dramatic price overruns.)\n\nThe president claims the ballroom is being funded entirely by donations, which I believe without evidence, as I’ve certainly never known Trump to lie or engage in dodgy backroom agreements. And besides, who cares? WE’RE GETTING A BALLROOM!\n\nFor so long, my dream has been for the White House to have a ballroom\n\nWhen I first walked past the White House at age 7, my parents had to comfort me as my eyes welled up with tears and I, unable to raise my voice above a whisper, asked: “Mummy and daddy, why is there no giant, gaudy ballroom?”\n\nSince that day, my vision ‒ the sun around which my political beliefs have orbited ‒ has been this: An exterior wall of the White House’s historic East Wing gets ripped to shreds by a twice-impeached convicted felon serving his second term in office, all to make way for a $250 million metaphor being built while the federal government is shut down and many workers aren’t getting paid. The construction will involve a sprawling ballroom with towering ceilings, gorgeous chandeliers, seating for 650 people and gold, gold and more gold! And it all happens without oversight by preservationists or a lick of input from the American people.\n\nFolks, my vision is becoming reality. America is getting a fantastic Trump-approved White House ballroom!

The next day, the White House scrapped the memo to \"end any confusion created by the court's injunction.\"\n\n\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Jan. 29.\n\n\"The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented,\" she added.\n\nThe White House's latest actions did little to quell fears.\n\n\"My sense is that nonprofits are still trying to process all of these rapid developments but that the White House social media statement is only likely to create further confusion,\" said David Heinen, vice president for public policy and advocacy at the North Carolina Center of Nonprofits.\n\nIf a funding freeze is ultimately implemented, it could have a devastating impact on area nonprofits, especially those in WNC working in the wake of Helene.\n\n“Not that there’s a good time, but this is a particularly bad time for this to happen,” Heinen told the Citizen Times Jan. 28, the day before the memo was rescinded. “Especially in the early stages of recovery.”\n\nHeinen said he worried the funding freeze would temporarily shut down the operations of some nonprofits, or at least, prove incredibly disruptive to their housing, health care, early childhood, disaster recovery, and aging programs.\n\nCassidy Moore, the government relations and grants manager for Asheville Area Habitat for Humanity, told the Citizen Times Jan. 28 that a federal funding freeze would be “catastrophic to the recovery of WNC.”\n\n“It will impact assistance that helps keep people in their homes, helps address and prevent homelessness, and that fund other critical housing programs,” Moore said. “It also impacts resources for infrastructure, business, healthcare, childcare, community revitalization and more.”\n\nBefore the White House rescinded its memo, Dan Leroy, president and CEO of United Way of Asheville and Buncombe County, told the Citizen Times that the White House's order \"has the potential to unravel a safety net for millions of vulnerable community members and, locally, hamper recovery efforts.”\n\n\"The people in our community, this region, have been through a tremendous amount of trauma in the months following Helene,\" Leroy said. \"Right now, there are a lot of unknowns related to this directive, which adds unnecessary stress and chaos to their lives.\"\n\n‘Congress controls the purse strings, not him’\n\nThe Trump administration’s memo, which came three days after Trump said the “days of betrayal and neglect are over” for the Helene-ravaged region, faced significant resistance from state leaders concerned about the impact on recovery efforts.\n\nIn a Jan. 28 post on X, Gov. Josh Stein said he was reviewing the memo and “working with federal partners to ensure people in WNC get the support they need.”\n\nWhen Stein met Trump on the tarmac of Asheville Regional Airport in Fletcher on Jan. 24, the Democratic governor asked Trump for an additional $20 billion in disaster relief for the state, plus six more months of 100% reimbursement for eligible FEMA expenses, the Citizen Times previously reported.\n\n“Families, businesses and communities are struggling and need these urgent resources to help them rebuild,” Stein said at the time. “I look forward to working with the Trump Administration in the coming weeks and months to get people what they need to rebuild and recover.”\n\nAdditionally, attorneys general from several states, including North Carolina, filed a lawsuit in federal court attempting to block the order.\n\n“Late last year, Congress approved spending $29 billion in federal funds for disaster recovery, small business aid, and road and bridge repairs in hurricane-hit states,” North Carolina Attorney Jeff Jackson wrote in a news release announcing the lawsuit. “The federal government’s freeze could delay receipt of these funds, disrupting recovery efforts and delaying North Carolinians’ ability to repair their homes, businesses, roads, and bridges, and revitalize western North Carolina.”\n\nRep. Chuck Edwards and Sen. Thom Tillis did not respond to a Citizen Times requests for comment about the memo.\n\nDespite the confusion it sowed, a spokesperson for Sen. Ted Budd told the Citizen Times that the directive would not have impacted disaster recovery efforts in North Carolina.\n\n“President Trump’s first trip after being sworn-in was to Western North Carolina and demonstrates how committed he is to their long-term recovery,” Budd’s office said Jan. 28. “All other narratives to the contrary are misleading.”\n\nDirect assistance to individuals through programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were not expected to be affected by the White House directive.\n\nIt's unclear the toll the funding freeze would have taken on local governments reeling amid Helene-related budget constraints. Before the memo was rescinded, both the city of Asheville and Buncombe County were working to understand any potential consequences the directive would have had for services and Helene recovery.\n\nBut for some area nonprofits, the consequences were clearer.\n\nIf a funding freeze were to go into effect, Judith Long, interim executive director of the Council on Aging of Buncombe County, told the Citizen Times that it would have threatened much of the organization's programming, which is funded in part through the Older Americans Act.\n\n“Right now, we’re hoping the pushback, the lawsuits, against this unconstitutional order will succeed,” Long said. “Congress controls the purse strings, not him.”\n\nLong said 76% of the organization’s $1.2 million budget comes from federal funding, paying for programming like its four congregant dining centers and homebound food delivery.\n\nWithout federal funding, most of the nonprofit’s programming would be wiped out, she said.\n\n“We may be able to salvage one or two things,” Long said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nJacob Biba is the Helene Recovery Reporter at the Asheville Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Two weeks later, 753 people had been diagnosed, a number that continued to rise overnight. As of noon on Friday, May 15, 765 people in the county had been diagnosed.\n\nAnd severe coronavirus cases increased at an even higher rate, according to partial hospitalization numbers released within the county, with a significant number of patients requiring ICU care and mechanical ventilation treatment.\n\n\"We aren't in safe territory yet,\" said Mayor Steven Reed on Thursday. \"People have to be reminded that we are not out of this, [though] there is probably COVID-19 fatigue.\"\n\nMontgomery was cited in the internal White House report, reported by NBC News this week, which denoted Alabama's capital city as a \"location to watch,\" as the area had seen a precipitous increase of cases in a week-to-week increase.\n\nThe report cited a more than 100% week-to-week increase in new cases in the Montgomery area. The report was dated May 7, just a day before Gov. Kay Ivey released a new coronavirus order, walking back previous restrictions on things such as dine-in restaurants and hair salons, despite previous comments state officials made about waiting to see a 14-day decline in statewide cases, per White House guidelines.\n\nWhen asked if he would have relaxed coronavirus restrictions to the level Ivey did on May 8, Reed gave a succinct answer.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Reed said. \"... There is still danger that exists. And there is more danger for vulnerable populations, whether that be our seniors or people with underlying health conditions. We're still trying to find a way out of this pandemic. We're not at that point yet. We have to continue what many people were doing about a month ago. People may have loosened up a little bit, but we've got to tighten up our protocols.\"\n\nDr. Wick Many, an infectious disease physician in Montgomery who served on the faculty of the UAB School of Medicine Montgomery campus for 32 years, said the current rise in infections likely occurred prior to the loosening of restrictions. Given the long incubation time of COVID-19, it can take weeks for a person infected to fall ill.\n\nBut Many conveyed deep concern at the public messaging around the coronavirus in Alabama and Montgomery, calling it \"dismaying\" to go out in public and see people walking around without masks or disregarding other recommendations from doctors and scientists.\n\n\"This was building as the restrictions were being lifted,\" Many said. \"The problem is when the word came that we were relaxing restrictions, people thought we were over it. 'Let's get back to normal,' whatever normal is. Personally, I think the public is not getting the right message. ... The absolute number of critically ill patients is increasing \"\n\nReed acknowledged the economic pain the pandemic has brought on business and individuals, and said he understands the frustrations as a mayor of a city that relies on things like tax revenue in the hospitality sector.\n\n\"But we don't want to put the wealth of the community over the health of the community,\" Reed said. \"There is no easy fix for this. It's uncharted waters, and we're still trying to feel our way through. We may be seeing numbers that are taking us to our peak. We're trying to be proactive in managing that so people don't unnecessarily becoming affected and certainly don't die because of a premature return.\"\n\nDespite restrictions being lifted, Many urged Montgomery-area citizens and all Alabamians to follow the advice of experts and not to downplay the risk of this global pandemic.\n\n\"Overnight, there were 23 new deaths in a 24-hour period. 473 deaths in Alabama. That's in a little bit over three months,\" Many said. \"If you had any other infectious disease, if you reported today there were 473 new tuberculosis deaths in Alabama, people would be screaming it from the rooftops. I'm concerned that the message is not being consistently delivered to the general public. This is still a problem, we still have to follow the guidelines.\"\n\nThe Montgomery Advertiser on Friday asked Gov. Kay Ivey if, given spiking numbers in the capital city and a continuing upwards trajectory of case in Alabama, she was still comfortable with her May 8 order re-opening Alabama, if she is reconsidering implementing any additional restrictions or if a certain threshold of new cases would trigger additional restrictions.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Ivey acknowledged coronavirus diagnoses and deaths, as well as mentioned the \"more than 400,000 people\" who have filed for unemployment in recent weeks, \"more than the previous two years combined.\"\n\n“Alabamians are hurting, and I am committed to helping these hundreds of thousands of people and every Alabama family restore their livelihoods. For that reason, we have been taking steps to safely reopen our state’s economy,\" Ivey said. “Let me be abundantly clear: the threat of COVID-19 remains. Montgomery, Alabama has been identified as a spot to watch as COVID-19 cases rise, and the virus continues to be present across the state. This health crisis is not behind us. I urge Alabamians to stay smart and vigilant as we continue practicing social distancing guidelines to combat this virus. Let us do our part and practice personal responsibility. Alabamians have made sacrifices over the last couple of months, and each of us must continue doing all we can to stay safe and protect our own health, as well as our neighbors’ health. We are in this together, Alabama.”\n\n'Emotionally and physically exhausted'\n\nAn increase in cases is to be expected as access to testing, which Alabama was comparatively slow to roll out, continues to increase. But Reed and hospital officials in the Montgomery area are concerned about the increase in hospitalizations and strain it is putting on resources and health care workers already caring for non-coronavirus patients.\n\nAccording to data from Baptist Health, which operates two Montgomery hospitals and a third nearby in Autauga County, hospitalizations doubled in two Montgomery hospitals between May 1 and May 14. A third Montgomery hospital, Jackson Hospital, has declined to make its data public, though it says it is following mandatory reporting guidelines to state officials.\n\nIn Baptist East and South, 32 patients were hospitalized on May 1. By May 14, 68 were hospitalized in the two Montgomery hospitals. Eight were hospitalized in the Prattville hospital.\n\nOf those, nearly 30% were in ICU care and about 26% were on mechanical ventilation.\n\nAccording to the FY2019 Annual Reports for Hospitals and Related Facilities, Montgomery County hospitals have a 92-bed ICU capacity: 12 at Baptist Medical Center East, 30 at Jackson Hospital and 50 at Baptist Medical Center South.\n\nBy comparison, UAB Hospital in Jefferson County, which has 481 more confirmed cases than Montgomery, was caring for 45 coronavirus patients as of May 15.\n\n\"The hospitals have the physician and nursing expertise,\" and aren't yet overwhelmed, Many said. \"But they are having to be very mindful of the conservation of [personal protective equipment.] In some circumstances, they're having to come up with novel ways to safely reuse the PPE. They are becoming emotionally and physically exhausted.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic begin sweeping the country earlier this year, a prevailing fear in the health care community was the availability of critical care space and ventilators, the mechanical treatment that would help severely ill patients breathe while their body fought the illness. Places such as Italy saw the devastating effects of rationing ventilators, an issue later seen in hard-hit New York City.\n\nMany said Montgomery's hospitals are not at that threshold, but health care providers are already having to make hard choices.\n\n\"They are having to make some very difficult decisions, decisions I never had to make in 40 years of practicing medicine in the Montgomery area,\" Many said, pointing to the limited doses of an experimental treatment drug that have recently been distributed to Alabama hospitals. \"If they have one dose and two patients left, how do you decide which patient? I have never had to make that decision. It strikes me as being incredibly painful.\"\n\nAnd Montgomery physicians aren't just serving county citizens. Montgomery's hospitals are, in some cases, the closest medical institutions for nearby counties. Montgomery abuts Lowndes County, which is currently charting the second highest per capita infection rate in the state at nearly 120 infections per 10,000 people.\n\nLowndes has only been outpaced by Butler County, its southwest neighbor, which currently sits at 128 infections per 100,000. Butler's 59-bed medical center only has capacity for seven ICU beds, according to the most recent state data, while Lowndes has no hospital at all.\n\n\"The smaller community hospitals look to Montgomery, particularly the more complex hospitals such as Baptist South, because of their size and lack of pulmonary physicians,\" Many said. \"Physicians will refer their patients of Montgomery.\"\n\nLocal restrictions\n\nThough Reed said Alabama and the Montgomery area have more resources available to fight coronavirus than in previous months, he would like to see increased testing made available to potential asymptomatic carriers who may be unknowingly spreading the virus, in addition to additional \"contact tracing,\" which tracks and identifies the spread of infections to find emerging hot spots or areas of concern.\n\n\"Any way you look at it, the numbers aren't favorable to us,\" Reed said Thursday. \"They aren't where I'd like us to be as the governor eases restrictions in Alabama. I think there is more we have to do before we're fully ready to open up.\"\n\nReed said he and other city officials have discussed possible restrictions they could take at a city level if numbers continue to increase. Montgomery currently remains under a state of emergency order and is still implementing a nightly curfew. When asked if he would consider a face mask requirement, as Birmingham has implemented, Reed said the city was studying plans other cities have implemented to see what might work for Montgomery, practically and legally.\n\n\"We're trying to let people know that in this community that we aren't at a point where we can let our guard down,\" Reed said.\n\nMany urges Alabamians to continue to stay at home and social distance unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\"The challenge in our part of Alabama is a lot of folks cannot work from home. If you work in a plant, for example, you can't work from home,\" Many said. \"But if you don't have to get out, if you don't have to go out for something, don't. Stay home, it's safe there. There will be time in the future to go and party, to go to a dinner in a nice restaurant, to have a wedding reception. There will be time for that in the future. Now is not the time. You stay home unless you absolutely have to get out.\"\n\nIf you must leave the house, Many pointed to the recommended guidelines of handwashing, social distancing and face masks that he says everyone should follow to help slow the spread of infections.\n\n\"Montgomery is fortunate in that we do have some highly professional, dedicated health care workers, physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, who are putting their own personal safety at risk to serve their community,\" Many said. \"Any time you have a chance to say thank you, say thank you. And since they're putting themselves at personal risk, we have an obligation to do these things. If you're not going to do it for yourself, do it for those health care professionals who are putting their safety at risk.\"\n\nContact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Melissa Brown at 334-240-0132 or mabrown@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/08/bidens-buy-home-cape-henlopen/382821001/", "title": "Bidens buy home in Cape Henlopen State Park area", "text": "Updated June 8, 2017, 9:35 p.m. ET\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, are spreading their roots downstate, after recently purchasing a vacation home overlooking Cape Henlopen State Park.\n\n“Throughout our careers, Jill and I have dreamed of being able to buy a place at the beach at home where we can bring the whole family,\" Biden said in a statement released Thursday. \"We feel very lucky that we're now able to make that happen and are looking forward to spending time with our family in the place that matters most to us in the world.\"\n\nBiden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield declined to release the specific location of the property or provide details on when the Bidens are expected to move in.

It is an imprint of Macmillan.\n\nThe first of Joe Biden's books will specifically look at how he worked at the White House while dealing with the loss of his son Beau, who died in May 2015 from brain cancer.\n\nApart from writing his memoir, Biden hasn't slowed down or wandered far from the public spotlight since leaving office.\n\nLast month, he launched a new political action committee, American Possibilities, to support Democratic political candidates. The move also signaled that he may still be weighing a third presidential run.\n\nA new Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, a nonpartisan research and policy center, will focus on developing solutions to the most vexing domestic issues. Biden will also lead the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania.

Gretchen Whitmer met with President Donald Trump to discuss issues important to Michigan, including jobs, tariffs and Great Lakes protection.\n\nThe meeting follows concerns that proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico could negatively impact Michigan's auto industry and manufacturing base.\n\nWhitmer, who has criticized some of Trump's policies, emphasized her commitment to working with the administration to benefit Michigan residents.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer met Thursday with President Donald Trump at the White House, following up on a conversation she had with him in the nation's capital last month.\n\n\"I had a productive meeting at the White House today with President Trump where we discussed bringing good paying jobs to Michigan,\" Whitmer told the Free Press in a statement. \"We also discussed tariffs, the importance of keeping our Great Lakes clean and safe, and additional defense investments in the state.\n\n\"I’m grateful for his time today and I’ll always work as hard as I can with anyone for the state of Michigan and its people,\" she added.\n\nWhitmer didn't provide any additional information about the meeting or what was said. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the discussion.\n\nThe meeting comes at a time when Michigan and the auto industry that plays such a large role in the state's economy are facing what could be the devastating effects of the president's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico. While those tariffs have mostly been suspended until early April, there are still deep concerns that the ones already in effect on aluminum and steel could have a disproportionate impact on the state and its manufacturing base.\n\nThe auto industry has deeply integrated supply chain lines throughout Mexico and Canada and is the second largest importer of all the states because of that.\n\nWhile in D.C., Whitmer also participated in an event with other swing state governors as part of the House Democratic Caucus retreat, according to a source with knowledge of the panel who was not authorized to speak publicly. The governor aimed to \"shed some light on her success leading a purple state and what Democrats can learn from her election victories,\" the source said.\n\nOn Wednesday, speaking with reporters in Livonia, Whitmer had some of her strongest words to date about the Trump administration's tariff proposals and cost-cutting measures announced throughout the federal government, raising concerns that plans to reduce the Department of Education's workforce by half and impose \"indiscriminate\" tariffs on allies is going to hurt Michigan families and workers and drive up costs.\n\nTrump has argued that tariffs are needed to make trade more fair for the U.S. and is also using them as leverage to push Canada and Mexico to combat illegal immigration into the U.S. and reduce the flow of illegal drugs. Both countries, as well as others worldwide, have promised to raise tariffs of their own, increasing the likelihood of a trade war. Stock market indices in the U.S. have plummeted in recent weeks as Trump has threatened and imposed tariffs.\n\nWhitmer was in the Washington, D.C. area to be part of a panel of governors speaking to U.S. House Democrats at a retreat in Leesburg, Virginia. Others on the panel included Democratic Govs. Josh Shapiro, of Pennsylvania, and Andy Beshear, of Kentucky.\n\nIn February, Whitmer, who campaigned against Trump as he ran for reelection last year and was a frequent foil of his during his first term in office, sat next to the Republican president at a White House dinner held as part of a National Governors Association conference. Whitmer said at the time that the two spoke then about Michigan's priorities and had agreed to have a meeting later to talk more.\n\nWhile some Democratic governors have taken a much more aggressive public posture toward Trump and the actions he has taken in his second term, Whitmer, who has been talked about by some pundits as a possible presidential candidate herself in the future, has noted that Trump won Michigan and it is her responsibility to try to find common ground with his administration to further state interests.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, Iowa, proposed the bill on Tuesday at the Land Investment Expo, the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. Minnesota borders Iowa to the north, and Bousselot wants the state to enter into negotiations with its neighbor. Although the text for the bill was not available as of Wednesday afternoon, the senator said his proposal has support from colleagues in the Iowa House and Senate.\n\n\"Make Minnesota Iowa Again!\" Bousselot said in a post on X. \"Our new Iowans, former MN residents, will have lower income, sales, business taxes.

Yeah, 100%,” Trump said, according to the news outlet.\n\nVance heaped criticism on Denmark during his Friday visit, accusing the country of lagging on security and leaving Greenland open to invasion from Russia and China. He encouraged the people of Greenland to break away from Denmark to create space for the United States to have a conversation with the territory about acquiring it.\n\nHe told reporters after that he was not signaling a change in the administration's policy. Rather, he said, he was emphasizing that Trump does not believe military force is needed for the United States to take over Greenland.\n\n\"We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,\" Vance said at Pituffik Space Base.\n\nAsked about the comments during the NBC interview, Trump recommitted to taking control of the island but said there's a \"good possibility\" that the United States can do it without the assistance of the military.\n\n\"No, I never take military force off the table. But I think there's a good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" Trump said. \"We have an obligation to protect the world. This is world peace, this is international security. And I have that obligation while I'm president. No, I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nVance's visit with Trump administration officials and his wife, Usha, replaced a multiday trip that the second lady had planned to make without her husband. The original schedule was scrapped after Greenland's former prime minister called the move \"highly aggressive\" and a \"provocation,\" and the government said the U.S. delegation was not invited to tour the island.\n\nThe vice president and U.S. officials, including Trump's national security adviser Michael Waltz, instead visited the military base.\n\nIn his remarks, Vance said Denmark had \"underinvested\" in the security of Greenland.\n\n\"Our message to Denmark is very simple. You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\" he said. \"That has to change. And because it hasn’t changed, this is why President Trump’s policy in Greenland is what it is.\"\n\nDenmark's foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, hit back at Vance on X after the visit, saying in a video on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that his country can take criticism but does not \"appreciate the tone\" of the Trump administration's comments about his country.\n\n\"This is not how you speak to your close allies,\" he said.\n\nHe invited the United States to work with Denmark to enhance its military presence in Greenland.\n\nGreenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, also said the comments showed a \"lack of respect\" for the island.\n\nDenmark is a NATO ally and Greenland's residents say they are opposed to becoming a part of the United States.\n\nStill, the U.S. president has pressed ahead. \"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security. We have to have Greenland,\" he said on Friday at the White House.\n\nAsked by NBC what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia, which has sought to expand its own territorial footprint, and the rest of the world, Trump said: \"I don’t really think about that. I don’t really care. Greenland’s a very separate subject, very different. It’s international peace. It’s international security and strength.\"\n\nTrump talks 'Signalgate' and tariffs\n\nTrump also said Saturday that he still has confidence in his national security team following the explosive revelation that Waltz inadvertently included the editor of The Atlantic in a text chain where officials discussed an attack on Houthi militants in Yemen before it happened.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details of the strike in a group chat on Signal, an encrypted text messaging app, with Waltz, Vance and other senior officials in Trump administration.\n\n“I don’t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” Trump told NBC News Saturday.\n\nThe administration has acknowledged that a journalist was accidentally added to the conversation but denied that any of the information discussed was classified.\n\nThe U.S. president also said he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raise vehicle prices because of his 25% tariff on imports − saying \"people are gonna buy American-made cars\" if the prices on foreign vehicles increase.\n\nHe also said he would move ahead with far-reaching duties due to take effect April 2 unless affected countries offer him something in return.\n\n\"Only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there's no room for negotiation,\" Trump said.\n\nContributing: Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/29"}]}

It’s Jan. 6, I was at the U.S. Capitol, totally fired up to do a coup with you all, and nobody else showed up. Did I miss a memo or something?\n\nIt was definitely Monday. Congress convened and counted the electoral voters certifying Donald Trump’s presidential win, exactly four years after all those Trump supporters went full insurrectionist and tried to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nAnd thanks to you, dummies, we missed it. I thought we had a plan, people! Did freakin’ everybody oversleep?\n\nI hope you all didn’t just chicken out. I mean, we know from the last insurrection that doing an insurrection is both legal and patriotic. I know some of you were a little jumpy thinking it might be “treasonous” or “clearly against the law” or “un-American.”\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nBut that’s hogwash.\n\nTrump and tons of other Republicans think it’s wrong that those last insurrectionists wound up in prison, since all they did was violently storm the U.S. Capitol, assault and injure dozens of police officers, and chant stuff about hanging then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe only reason they wound up in prison is because everything they did was on video and they either pleaded guilty or were found guilty by juries, and you know MAGA folks don’t believe in the so-called law. Heck, Trump has called them “hostages” and said he’s going to pardon them.\n\nSo there’s no way the incoming president or his supporters would have held it against us if we engaged in a light attack on our nation’s Capitol in an effort to subvert the will of the American people. I thought we all reached the same conclusion: They would call us heroes and great patriots and let us record a cool version of the national anthem that could get played at large political rallies.\n\nGeez, you all, we went over this at every single Antifa meeting! If they get one free attempted coup, we get one free attempted coup. That’s how this country works.\n\nAnd we wouldn’t have been as violent and noisy as those MAGA folks were. We had the whole darn thing organized, every liberal insurrectionist paired with a coup buddy so nobody could get out of hand, a team of helpers pulling up the rear to quickly clean up and recycle any broken glass or other debris. We even had a strict “no smearing poop on the walls” policy in place.\n\nIt would have been a perfectly respectable attempt to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power and then later be exonerated because Republicans and President-elect Trump have made it clear they’re perfectly fine with a quadrennial insurrection.\n\nBut no, you all had to bag the whole thing and leave me standing at the steps of the U.S. Capitol with my giant horned helmet, blue face paint and “Harris/Walz Won! Stop The Steal!” sign, looking like a total dummy.\n\nIt was so embarrassing. A couple of dudes in MAGA hats laughed at me, you guys. Unbelievable.\n\nNow we have to wait four more years before we can get our turn to coup! And who knows if Trump and Republicans will still be OK with coup-ing at that point. They’ll probably be back to thinking it’s bad or something.\n\nI can’t believe this.

Since taking office, Trump has pardoned nearly 1,600 people involved in the insurrection.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jan. 6, Democrats held a hearing entitled \"After Jan. 6: Setting the Record Straight on the Capitol Insurrection,\" which featured testimony from officers, witnesses and Democratic lawmakers, including U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, who was among those trapped in the Capitol as it was being attacked.\n\n\"The videos, audio, and photographs of the violent domestic terrorists who attacked the Capitol five years ago are still very chilling for those of us who were there that day, and frankly much of what we’ve heard today is really triggering,\" Escobar, D-El Paso, said during the hearing. \"For those of us who were trapped in the gallery, it's really hard to relive that terror and that trauma and so I'm grateful to all of you for your strength and resilience.\"\n\nFor his part, Trump has asserted that Democrats are to blame for the riot.\n\n\"The Democrats masterfully reversed reality after January 6, branding peaceful patriotic protesters as 'insurrectionists' and framing the event as a violent coup attempt orchestrated by Trump — despite no evidence of armed rebellion or intent to overthrow the government,\" a statement on the White House website read. \"In truth, it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection by certifying a fraud-ridden election, ignoring widespread irregularities, and weaponizing federal agencies to hunt down dissenters, all while (for House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi’s own security lapses invited the chaos they later exploited to seize and consolidate power. This gaslighting narrative allowed them to persecute innocent Americans, silence opposition, and distract from their own role in undermining democracy.\"\n\nMuch of Escobar's ire was directed at Trump, who she said betrayed \"the brave men and women who defended us and our nation’s capital that day.\"\n\n\"It is absolutely shameful that while Donald Trump pardoned and released nearly 1,600 of those insurrectionists — members of the violent mob — there are law enforcement professionals who were forced to retire, who are still struggling today, who still have to get physical therapy, who still have to undergo serious behavioral health treatment, all because they defended our democracy and defended us,\" she said. \"Many of those who were pardoned have gone on to commit additional crimes, like child molestation, kidnapping, and sexual assault — and by the way, they're back in D.C. today. They are celebrating themselves and they are marching to the Capitol.\"\n\nWhile many Republicans have shared Trump's explanation of the Capitol riot, at least one took the side of officers — U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-San Antonio. He was among the few Republicans to vote to establish the Jan. 6 Commission to investigate the riot.\n\nGonzales did not release a statement on the hearing and could not be reached for comment.\n\nWhile the sting of seeing the perpetrators of the violent attack on the Capitol pardoned is bad enough, worse is the fact that officers are being denied their public safety officers' benefits, Escobar said. She added that to date, not a single officer has received this benefit, and many have resorted to GoFundMe accounts to stay afloat.\n\n\"We have to fix this,\" she said. \"We have to address this. This is not right.\"\n\nAdding insult to injury is the fact that Trump has discussed the possibility of establishing a \"compensation fund\" for the insurrectionists.\n\n\"(We) cannot let this happen,\" Escobar said. \"We will not let this happen. I want to again thank these law enforcement heroes for saving our lives. For their courage, for their commitment, and for their resilience.\"\n\n\"Every American should know that this administration, led by the man who inspired this attack, and who has never faced accountability for this attack — this administration rewards criminals and punishes patriots,\" she continued. \"As long as we are alive, we will not allow history to be whitewashed, and as long as we are in public service, we have to remain committed to a country where truth matters, and where these patriots are protected and upheld.\"\n\nAdam Powell covers government and politics for the El Paso Times and can be reached via email at apowell@elpasotimes.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/06/congress-certify-jan-6-donald-trump/77242723007/", "title": "Congress certifies Trump 2024 victory, 4 years after Capitol riot: Recap", "text": "Updated Jan. 6, 2025, 4:37 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON − Congress certified Donald Trump's 2024 election victory on Monday in a civil proceeding, four years after the president-elect's supporters rioted and attacked the Capitol building in a deadly insurrection.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris presided over the counting of the electoral votes in the House chambers, leading the certification of the election she lost to Trump.\n\nWith the nation's capital carpeted in snow and the Capitol grounds ringed in security fencing, Trump was certified the 2024 winner without a single objection. In a 40-minute ceremony, each state's votes were tallied, and lawmakers cheered for their delegations.\n\nBut members of Congress also reflected on the four years since the Capitol riot. On Jan. 6, 2021, a group of the president-elect's supporters, driven by false claims of election fraud, stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to block President Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nCatch up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nDemocrats have a symbolic moment\n\nDemocratic leaders and the House chaplain, Margaret Grun Kibben, are at the site where Capitol rioters first breached the building in 2021. The chaplain opened with a prayer.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was less than 20 feet from rioters as he was ferried out of the Senate chamber that day.\n\n“We must never forget,” Schumer said. “Democracy is both sacred, its roots are deep, but at times it can be fragile.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Jan. 6, 2021 was “a day that will live in infamy.”\n\n“Hopefully today the peaceful transfer of power should serve as an example of how we as a country should move forward,” Jeffries said.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nDemocratic caucus stays unusually quiet with zero objections\n\nJan. 6, 2025, marked the first time that not a single congressional Democrat objected to certifying a Republican president-elect since 1988.\n\nDemocrats objected 11 times in 2017 when lawmakers were gathered to certify Trump's first presidential win. And 31 House Democrats in 2005 opposed certifying former President George W. Bush's reelection victory in Ohio, citing voting issues in the state.\n\nIn spite of these interruptions, electoral certification had been a traditionally routine process that garnered little attention from average Americans outside Washington before four years ago.\n\nIn 2021, 147 House and Senate Republicans opposed certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 win, shortly before a group of Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol in a violent attempted insurrection.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris speaks after overseeing electoral vote count\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president in the 2024 election, oversaw the electoral vote count in her role as president of the Senate.\n\nToday was about \"a peaceful transfer of power,\" she told reporters following the ceremony.\n\n\"Today, I did what I have done my entire career, which is take seriously the oath that I have taken many times to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" she said, \"which included today, performing my constitutional duty to ensure that the people of America, the voters of America, will have their votes counted, that those votes matter, and that they will determine then with the outcome of an election.\"\n\nShe did not take questions from reporters.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\n'Particularly admirable': Mike Pence praises Kamala Harris for Jan. 6 duties\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it was “particularly admirable” that Vice President Kamala Harris presided over the certification of Trump’s 2024 presidential victory.\n\n“The peaceful transfer of power is the hallmark of our democracy and today, members of both parties in the House and Senate along with the vice president certified the election of our new president and vice president without controversy or objection,” he said.\n\n“I also commend the members of the House, Senate and the Vice President who did their duty under the Constitution of the United States, it being particularly admirable that Vice President Harris would preside over the certification of a presidential election that she lost,” he later added in the post.\n\nTrump in 2021 urged Pence to reject President Joe Biden’s electoral votes as Pence oversaw the certification of the 2020 election. However, Pence insisted that he never had that authority, even as rioters threatened his life, saying at the time that there’s “almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'Absolute horror'\n\nWhen Maxwell Goddard, 29, woke up four years on Jan. 6, he didn't expect rioters would succeed in breaching the Capitol building.\n\n\"I watched that day as it unfolded in absolute horror,\" said Goddard outside the building four years later. Standing in front of a tall fence wearing a light jacket in the snow, Goddard held a sign reading \"14th Amendment Section 3.\"\n\nThe amendment states that officials are disqualified from holding office if they have \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against the U.S. government.\n\nGoddard flew all the way from his home in Merrimack, New Hampshire, to demonstrate in front of the Capitol.

The Capitol complex was finally secured by 8 p.m., and lawmakers came back into session around 9 p.m. However, more Republican lawmakers objected to results in key swing states. Congress finally declared Biden’s victory shortly after 3 a.m. the next day.\n\nIn 2009, it took 36 minutes to name Barack Obama president. In 2013, Obama's reelection was certified in 22 minutes.

Trump has called the Jan. 6 defendants “warriors” and politicial prisoners − and has promised pardons for some.\n\n“They're insurrectionists,\" Warren said. \"This is what transfer of power is supposed to look like.

A source close to Trudeau told Reuters on Sunday the prime minister was likely to announce plans to step down, but had not made a final decision.\n\nThe telegenic son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is under pressure to step down ahead of an anticipated election wipeout for the Liberals.

He was sentenced to 24 months of probation — the first two under home confinement — and was ordered to pay $500 in restitution.\n\n\"He made a grave error in judgment by following the crowd onto the Capitol grounds, scaling the wall and entering the rotunda,\" Shamansky said. \"He committed no acts of violence and he was deeply remorseful for participating in this gross assault on our democracy.\"\n\nShamansky said the 24-year-old Jones \"accepted responsibility, unlike most of the traitors that were present that day, and was not a supporter of the far right's goal of disrupting our democracy.\"\n\nJones and the five other Ohioans who have pleaded guilty are in a distinct minority.\n\nAs of Tuesday, according to the DOJ, just 167 of the more than 725 defendants had entered guilty pleas. The overwhelming majority, 145, pleaded to misdemeanor offenses, while 22 admitted to felonies. Six of the felonies involved charges related to assaults on officers.\n\nSeveral charged in Capitol riot from Greater Columbus\n\nThe Dispatch tracked down the most-recent address for each of the Ohio defendants and determined that more live in Franklin County — 7 — than any county in the state.\n\nNo defendants were from the state's next two largest counties, Cuyahoga (Cleveland) and Hamilton (Cincinnati).\n\nThe region of Ohio with the highest number of defendants is the southwest, with 12, spread among Montgomery, Clinton, Warren, Butler and Greene counties.\n\nCentral Ohio is next with 10 defendants, dominated by Franklin County, but with one each in Delaware, Madison and Fayette counties.\n\nGuilty pleas from Ohioans charged in Jan. 6 riot\n\nLike Jones' case, the other guilty pleas by Ohioans were to misdemeanors:\n\n• Derek Jancart, 39, of Canal Winchester, pleaded guilty in July to misdemeanor disorderly conduct in the Capitol. He was sentenced in September to 45 days of incarceration and ordered to pay $500 in restitution.\n\n• Brandon Miller, 35, and Stephanie Miller, 31, a husband and wife from Bradford, a village in Darke and Miami counties, each pleaded guilty in September to a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol Building. Both were sentenced in December, him to 20 days in jail and her to 14 days in jail. Each also must perform 60 hours of community service and pay $500 in restitution.\n\n• Oliver Sarko, 27, of Columbus' East Side, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol Building. He is scheduled to be sentenced in February.\n\n• Erik Rau, 43, of Columbus' Far West Side, pleaded guilty in July to a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct in the Capitol. He was sentenced in September to 45 days of incarceration and ordered to pay $500 in restitution.\n\nRau was represented by Columbus lawyer Brian Joslyn, who said his client cooperated with the FBI.\n\nHe said Rau was among many who followed the crowd into the Capitol after the building was breached and \"waves\" of others had entered, wandering around, but not engaging in violence or destruction of property.\n\n\"He met with them and provided information that might have helped them,\" Joslyn said. \"I was hoping to avoid a charge entirely, but because of the political landscape, the prosecutor said she couldn't do that.\"\n\nIn addition to handling Jones' guilty plea, Shamansky said he plans to take the case of another defendant, Dustin Thompson of Columbus' East Side, to trial.\n\nThompson, he said, \"was the victim of Donald Trump and his friends' indoctrination plot and scheme to overthrow the results of his loss... The question is, why would ordinary, everyday citizens such as Mr. Thompson travel there? Because he was brainwashed and indoctrinated, which is exactly what they set out to do. They used these poor folks as pawns.\"\n\nNone of the defendants in the breach of the Capitol has gone to trial, and Shamansky said he hopes \"ours is the first.\"\n\nHow the FBI investigations have worked\n\nInvestigators have relied heavily on surveillance videos from the Capitol grounds and building, as well as cellphone videos and photos posted by participants on social media to identify many of those who have been charged and to seek tips on the identities of others.\n\nIn addition, people on social media acting as amateur detectives have worked together and crowdsourced to match videos and photographs to insurrectionists at the scene and turned that information over to the FBI in an effort to make sure those involved in the assault on the Capitol face justice.\n\nThe FBI continues to seek the public's help in identifying more than 350 individuals believed to have committed violent acts on the Capitol grounds, including more than 250 for assaulting officers, according to the DOJ.\n\nImages and videos of the suspects, including some wanted for assaults on officers and members of the media, can be viewed at https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/capitol-violence#News\n\nSearch for Ohio cases\n\nCandlelight vigil set for Ohio Statehouse on Thursday evening\n\nColumbus will be the site of one of more than 220 events that will take place across the country to mark the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and send a message that \"voters decide the outcome of elections,\" according to organizers.\n\nThe gathering in Columbus will take place at 6:30 p.m. Thursday outside the Ohio Statehouse. Participants are asked to meet at the William McKinley monument on the South High Street side of the Statehouse grounds.\n\nOther gatherings in the state are scheduled in Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, Medina and Kent.\n\nOrganizers allege that \"the same faction\" that incited the storming of the Capitol \"is working to restrict the freedom to vote, attacking fair voting districts and quietly preparing future attempts to sabotage free and fair elections.\"\n\nThe organizers of the Columbus event include Unitarian Universalist Justice Ohio and Our Revolution Central Ohio.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story contained incorrect information provided by the U.S. Department of Justice about the number of Ohio defendants who have pleaded guilty.

Less than three weeks after the attack on the Capitol, there were at least 75 arrests across the nation in connection with it, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nOne year later, 738 people face charges ranging from assaulting a federal officer, obstructing law enforcement, entering a restricted building or grounds, violent entry and disorderly conduct.\n\nIn December, the FBI conducted a raid in Anthony, Texas, on a home of a person who might have been involved in the insurrection. However, no charges tied to the insurrection have been filed in the case.\n\nEscobar said the FBI hasn't told her of any El Pasoans who participated in the riot, but she said she knows that there were members of the community who participated in breaching the Capitol.\n\n\"So, those who participated in breaching the Capitol, whether they were El Pasoans, or from elsewhere, they must be held accountable,\" Escobar said. \"They knew exactly what they were doing. They knew exactly what they were participating in, and they need to be held to account.\"\n\nEscobar and other U.S. representatives shared their first-hand experiences of the attack on the Capitol to commemorate the one-year anniversary and honor the lives of the Capitol police who were lost.\n\nA candlelit vigil near the U.S. Capitol was set to be held in the evening, as well as a performance by the Baltimore Urban Inspiration Choir.\n\nSen.

Walton sentenced him to three years in prison and three years of probation. Walton also ordered Thompson to pay $2,000 in restitution. Thompson will receive credit for time served in jail.\n\nU.S. attorneys had asked for a sentence of five years and 10 months in prison. Thompson’s attorney, Andrew M. Stewart, argued for a one-year prison sentence.\n\nMany defendants from the Capitol riots have taken plea deals, but Thompson chose to fight his charges at trial using a novel defense.\n\n“I was following presidential orders,” Thompson testified at his trial.\n\nColumbus defense attorney Sam Shamansky argued at the trial that Thompson and others had been brainwashed to believe the 2020 presidential election — which President Joe Biden won by more than seven million votes — was stolen and were acting on the direction of Trump to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”\n\nIn a letter to the court asking for a lenient sentence, Thompson apologized and blamed the misinformation and conspiracy theory rabbit hole he fell down during the pandemic.\n\n\"I love America and I’m ashamed of my actions on that day,\" Thompson said at his sentencing hearing. \"There’s no excuse for what I did.\"\n\nIn September, Walton sentenced Thompson’s codefendant, Robert Anthony Lyon to 40 days in prison.

The Senate Parliamentarian and her staff played a key role in the Congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election, which the insurrectionists sought to disrupt, prosecutors said.\n\nThompson stole a bottle of liquor, a coat rack and a pager belonging to the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms, which he admitted to at trial.\n\nWhile inside, Thompson took a video of himself celebrating the riot, according to prosecutors.\n\nThompson, who posed with the coat rack outside, attempted to claim at trial he took the rack to prevent the mob from using it as a weapon against police. Thompson later admitted that testimony was not truthful in his letter to the court seeking leniency.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney William Kennelly Dreher said during the sentencing hearing that the claim by Thompson at trial, under oath, insulted U.S. Capitol police officers, more than 100 of whom were injured on Jan. 6.\n\nWalton admonished Thompson for lying during the sentencing.\n\nDreher also pointed out that Thompson wore a bulletproof vest on Jan. 6 — which Thompson claims he found on the ground that day — as proof Thompson was prepared for violence.\n\njlaird@dispatch.com\n\n@LairdWrites", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/09/florida-residents-charged-jan-6-capitol-riot-proud-boys-oath-keepers/10003859002/", "title": "Florida still has the most people facing January 6 insurrection ...", "text": "Zac Anderson and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nUSA TODAY and USA TODAY NETWORK – FLORIDA\n\nUpdated June 9, 2022, 6:15 p.m. ET\n\nAs the Jan. 6 congressional hearings kick off, Florida still leads the nation with the most people charged with crimes related to the storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe U.S. House committee investigating the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, has scheduled two televised hearings on Thursday at 8 p.m. and Monday at 10 a.m., with more to follow.\n\nThe \"Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol\" — its formal name — will lay out what it learned from more than 1,000 interviews and nearly a year of work aimed at documenting the effort to disrupt certification of President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.\n\nFloridians played a prominent role in Jan. 6, with 91 residents charged with crimes related to the insurrection.\n\nMore on the Capitol riots: Florida emerges as a cradle of the insurrection as Jan. 6 Capitol riot arrests keep piling up\n\nThat's well ahead of second place Texas, which has 72 residents facing charges, according to a database maintained by USA TODAY.\n\nFlorida also has more than a third of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, the two most prominent far right extremist groups involved in storming the Capitol, charged for their actions on Jan. 6. Some of the most serious charges stemming from the insurrection have been leveled against these individuals.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice this week levied additional charges against five Proud Boys, including two from Florida, adding seditious conspiracy for their Jan. 6 involvement. The two Floridians are Enrique Tarrio, a Miami resident who once led the Proud Boys, and Joseph Biggs of Ormond Beach.\n\nThe DOJ also has charged 11 Oath Keepers, including four from Florida, with seditious conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nNationwide, 46 Proud Boys and 27 Oath Keepers have been charged with Jan. 6 crimes, and 11 of those Oath Keepers and 16 of the Proud Boys are from Florida.\n\nA year ago Florida and Texas were tied for the most people charged in connection to Jan. 6, with 47 each.

Box is currently detained in the notorious D.C. jail, located just two miles from the Capitol building.\n\nTrump has repeatedly pledged to free “most” of the J6 inmates, saying in a recent interview with Time Magazine that he’ll begin granting pardons “in the first hour” of his presidency. Though Trump has been vague about which individuals will receive a pardon, Box takes him at his word.\n\n“I am expecting a pardon and believe every J6er deserves a pardon, whether they were violent or nonviolent,” Box said, pointing to unfair treatment he believes Jan. 6 offenders faced in court.\n\nHe insisted that the “Patriot Pod” of the D.C. jail isn’t full of “Nick Fuentes and Richard Spencer types,” but rather “normal people” who had their lives uprooted following the events at the Capitol.\n\nThese are some of the Georgians who could be pardoned in a matter of weeks.\n\nMichael Bradley\n\nMichael Bradley of Forsyth is the latest Georgian to be sentenced for his role in the riot. A federal judge in D.C. gave him a five-year prison sentence on Dec. 17, the longest of any Georgian charged for the attack.\n\nThe 50-year-old mechanic was charged with assaulting police with a dangerous weapon, civil disorder, and impeding arrest – all felonies – as well as several misdemeanors.\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors described how Bradley entered Capitol grounds with a metal baton holstered to his hip. He swung the baton at a line of officers multiple times in the Lower West Terrace Tunnel, the site of some of the most violent attacks against law enforcement that day.\n\nBradley’s court-appointed attorney unsuccessfully tried to delay the sentencing, writing last month that it was “likely, if not certain” that the Department of Justice’s policy toward Jan. 6 defendants “will change markedly” after Trump takes office again.\n\nU.S. Senior District Judge Reggie B. Walton, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, didn’t accept that reasoning.\n\n“Speculation about what the future President might do once he takes office cannot trump what the legislature commands a judicial officer must do following a criminal conviction,” Walton responded.\n\nJack Wade Whitton\n\nHours after Jack Wade Whitton, a 33-year-old man from Locust Grove, participated in the riot on Jan. 6, he texted a photograph of his bloodied hands to a friend and declared, “This is from a bad cop… I fed him to the people.” He then said he didn’t know or care about the officer’s status.\n\nWhitton was referring to an officer whom, according to the Department of Justice, he had grabbed and dragged “head-first and face-down into the violent, angry mob of rioters.” The officer was then beaten with a baton and flagpole.\n\nCourt documents allege that Whitton also repeatedly punched officers and struck them with makeshift weapons including a metal crutch. At one point, he kicked at their riot shields, screaming at an officer, “You’re gonna die tonight!”\n\nThe Georgia business owner was arrested in April 2021 and pleaded guilty to assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers with a deadly or dangerous weapon. He was sentenced to nearly five years in prison in May 2024, but received credit for the three years he’s served since his arrest.\n\n“I tell you with confidence: I have changed,” Whitton reportedly said to the judge during his sentencing.\n\nLisa Eisenhart\n\nCertain individuals stood out among the crowd of thousands that day. One of them came to be known as “Zip Tie Guy.”\n\nThe man in question stole zip ties from a Capitol closet, strapped them to his belt, and entered the Senate gallery intending to “take senators hostage,” court documents read.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, online sleuths spent hours pouring over images and footage of Zip Tie Guy, who appeared to be aided by another woman.\n\nProsecutors eventually learned the pair’s identities: Eric Munchel of Nashville, Tennessee and his mother, 59-year-old Lisa Eisenhart of Woodstock, Georgia.\n\nProsecutors say that Eisenhart wore a tactical vest to the Capitol and encouraged others to fight with the police. Eisenhart was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for obstruction and conspiracy charges. Her son was sentenced to five years.\n\nDominic Box\n\nAs a self-described “citizen journalist,” Box livestreamed his march to the Capitol and showed viewers his time inside the building. After abandoning a plea deal, Box’s misdemeanors were upgraded to felony obstruction and civil disorder charges. In total, he faces a maximum sentence of 13 years.\n\nBox is the only Jan. 6 defendant without violent charges being held at the D.C. jail, where he’s been detained for 15 months. This has afforded him certain privileges. He has a paid position in the jail and is one of two certified barbers on the unit.\n\nHe was also the only man with a working radio on election night. As the evening wore on, Box called out the results to the other inmates from his cell.\n\nWhen it was clear that Trump had defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, Box’s cries echoed throughout the jail block: “We did it! Trump won! We’re going home, boys!”\n\nBut will Trump stay true to his word? Box and the other J6ers will have to wait to see if they do, indeed, get to go home.\n\nMelissa Cruz is an elections reporting fellow who focuses on voter access issues for the USA TODAY Network.

Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe January 6 insurrection was both a peak of contemporary American White nationalism and a dress rehearsal for what will likely come next.\n\nSimply put, the attack on the US Capitol was the culmination of political trends in the United States that have festered for decades – and a warning from history about how the politics of the next several years may unfold.\n\nThe most significant US political development during the past few years has been the rise of homegrown American extremism. This movement has many facets, from the growth of White nationalism to the embrace of QAnon conspiracy theories by a significant number of Americans.\n\nIn a Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May, 15% of Americans agreed that a Satanic ring of sex traffickers is running the United States government, financial sector and media, while 23% of Republicans endorsed this conspiracy theory. And, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted last month, one in three Americans now endorses the view that violence against the government is sometimes justified.\n\nThis is all compounded by the overall failure of those running social media platforms to police extremist content in a meaningful way; the deepening polarization of American politics; the profound distrust of government among those radicalized by the pandemic shutdowns and the role of former President Donald Trump as the chief arsonist fanning the flames of discord.\n\nThe dominance of Trumpism\n\nSix years ago, when Trump was running for president, I considered the issue of whether he was a fascist. To answer that question, I turned to the classic 2004 study, “The Anatomy of Fascism,” by American historian Robert Paxton, who forensically examined the fascist movements of 20th century Europe.\n\nPaxton found key commonalities among those movements, including the “superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason” and the “belief that one’s group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action.”\n\nThis certainly seemed to describe Trump and Trumpism in 2015, but there was one key trait of fascist leaders that Trump had only begun to embrace back then – their support of “the beauty of violence and the efficacy of will, when they are devoted to the group’s success.”\n\nAfter Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, he seemed more willing than ever before to call for violent action. Trump called his supporters to Washington, DC for a rally on the specious grounds that the election had been stolen from him – tweeting, “Be there, will be wild!” Thousands of his supporters gathered on January 6, where Trump further goaded them on by saying, “You’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”\n\nAs his supporters went on to attack the key symbol of American democracy, the US Capitol, Trump did nothing to stop them – despite the pleas of his family members and his reliable cheerleaders at Fox News to call off his followers. After approximately three hours, Trump finally told his supporters to “go home” in a video in which he continued to lie that the election was “fraudulent.”\n\nMonths later, Trump described the most spectacular attack on American democracy in decades as a manifestation of “spirit and faith and love.”\n\nBack in the reality-based world, the mayhem at the Capitol resulted in over 700 people being arrested, including 75 who were charged with violent crimes. Some 140 police officers were injured in the melee, according to the head of the Capitol Police officer’s union. And five people died as a result of the attack, including one officer.\n\nSo, it’s mystifying that Trump and his acolytes – such as Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, who told the crowd, “start taking down names and kicking ass” – have yet to be charged with incitement. In the crowd, there were large numbers of Trump followers in military style uniforms – some of whom were even wearing body armor – as well as members of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group. As a quick refresher, it is a crime to incite others to commit violent felony crimes if you have reason to believe they may carry out those crimes, according to US Code, Title 18, Section 373.\n\nFor context, this law has been applied in the past against people encouraging jihadist terrorists, such as Virginian Zachary Chesser, who is serving a long sentence, partly because he incited violence against the creators of the show “South Park,” after they portrayed the Prophet Mohammed in a critical light.\n\nImagine if all the mayhem at the Capitol had been instigated by Muslim leaders whipping up a mob of thousands of Islamists. Do you have any doubt that those Muslim leaders wouldn’t have already been prosecuted? (Disclosure: As a terrorism expert, I was interviewed by staff members of the bipartisan House committee investigating the January 6 attack, who were interested in discussing how the assault fit into the history of domestic terrorism in the United States.)\n\nThe Trump-inspired January 6 insurrection and its aftermath has primed the pump for more violence. According to the University of Chicago’s Project on Security and Threats, 9% of adults say they agree the use of force is justified to return Trump to the presidency.\n\nTrump has scheduled a rally in Arizona in mid-January, in which he will likely continue to push his false claim that the presidential election was stolen, which will surely further inflame his followers.\n\nThis discord is only likely to get worse because there are scant countervailing forces on the right pushing back on Trump, and those few Republican politicians who have pushed back are paying significant political costs. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming lost her position in the Republican leadership in the US House of Representatives, while Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois decided not to run for office again.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is likely to run again in the next presidential election cycle – and his dominance over the Republican Party appears stronger now than it was in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 insurrection.\n\nThe deep roots of January 6\n\nThe attack on the Capitol has deep roots in the anti-government, White nationalist movement. The intellectual godfather of that movement is William Luther Pierce, who profoundly influenced an entire generation – from the White supremacists who carried out the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 to extremists like today’s Proud Boys, who have discussed his writings online.\n\nWilliam Pierce, founder of the National Alliance, on January 4, 2000, in Hillsboro, West Virginia. Michael Williamson/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nA trained physicist, Pierce was also a key leader of the America neo-Nazi movement in the latter three decades of the 20th century. His most important contribution to White supremacist thought was “The Turner Diaries.” Pierce published this novel in 1978 using a pseudonym, Andrew Macdonald, and in it he charted the violent overthrow of the federal American government by a group of White “patriots” who blew up FBI headquarters and attacked the US Capitol. After a race war in which non-Whites are massacred, the novel ends with the establishment of an all-White United States.\n\nWhile certainly a clunky read, “The Turner Diaries” has been quite influential, selling hundreds of thousands of copies. A 2016 study by the extremism expert J.M. Berger found that the novel helped to inspire at least 40 terrorist attacks and hate crimes in the United States that resulted in at least 200 murders.\n\nThe most notorious example of the book’s influence was Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, who was so obsessed with it that he sold copies at gun shows around the United States. McVeigh modeled elements of his 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma federal building, which killed 168 people, on plot points that were in the novel. When McVeigh was arrested, law enforcement officials found quotations from the book in his car. (After the assault on the Capitol, Amazon pulled the book from its website).\n\nI produced Pierce’s first network interview in 1996 for CNN. In his compound deep in the woods of Appalachia in West Virginia, Pierce delivered a diatribe against the increasingly diverse United States. The bespectacled Pierce was an owlish presence, holding his cat in his lap as he was served tea by his younger wife who addressed him as “Sir.” A pair of male acolytes guarded Pierce’s lair, hanging on his every word.\n\nPierce explained that his novel was designed to be a call to action for White supremacists, telling CNN that perhaps the most important idea expressed in his book is that each person has to be an active participant in what is happening in the world around them.\n\nPierce died in 2002, but his bigoted ideas live on. Like many White supremacists, he was obsessed with the idea that White people were being “replaced” by other ethnic groups and that they had a duty to fight back. Those ideas continue to animate White supremacists and White nationalists, such as those who attended a racist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 – where they chanted, “Jews will not replace us!”\n\nFast forward to January 6, 2021. Members of far right groups, such as the Proud Boys, the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers, who all played a role in the assault on the Capitol, framed their attack in similar terms to the plot of “The Turner Diaries” – calling it a planned “insurrection” against “tyrants” and “traitors” who needed to be “executed.”\n\nLouis Beam, Grand Dragon of the Texas Realm of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, between two body guards on Feb. 14, 1981, in Santa Fe, Texas. Ed Kolenovsky/AP\n\nAnother strand of the White nationalist movement that could be seen in the assault on the US Capitol is “leaderless resistance,” a concept advocated by the prominent American racist Louis Beam in the early 1990s. It was a technique designed to enable his fellow racists to struggle against the American government without fear of being targeted by law enforcement agencies.\n\nBeam explained in online writings that the point of leaderless resistance was to keep individuals and groups operating independently, without a central headquarters or single leader – much like the groups pivotal to the January 6 attack.\n\nWhile there were certainly members of far right groups who played a role in the Capitol assault, hundreds of the assaulters had no connection to any organization, which made them harder to be tracked by law enforcement. They were ordinary Americans seemingly radicalized by what they read and saw on the internet and in right-wing media.\n\nAfter January 6\n\nThe White nationalist roots of January 6 go deep, but its future repercussions are also significant. A CNN poll released in September found that over three quarters of Republicans falsely believe Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election – and more than 50% of Republicans think there is evidence to support this misleading assertion.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThis means that irrespective of the actual results, Trump has likely set himself up well for the presidential election in 2024. He might win the 2024 election outright should he gain the Republican nomination. But should he lose, he has also laid considerable groundwork to make the argument to a sizable portion of the American public that the presidency is once again his.\n\nSuch claims may produce considerably more violence than what we saw at the Capitol a year ago, especially since millions of Americans now appear to approve of violence as a means to restore the Trump presidency.", "authors": ["Peter Bergen"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/16/florida-insurrection-capitol-riots-arrests-proud-boys-oath-keepers-jan-6-capitol-riot-charges/7720913002/", "title": "Florida emerges as a cradle of the insurrection as Jan. 6 Capitol riot ...", "text": "June 16, 2021, 5:22 p.m. ET\n\nFlorida is emerging as a cradle of the insurrection as the fallout from the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol building paints a clearer picture of those involved.\n\nFlorida is tied with Texas for the most individuals facing charges stemming from Jan. 6, with 47 arrests in each state out of the 484 total nationwide, according to a database maintained by USA Today.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/16"}]}

Scott Bannon, head of the Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, told al.com that the total haul was about 45,000 sacks of oysters at the end of the day on Dec. 20, compared with 22,070 sacks last season. “That’s about $3 million-plus to the catchers. So it’s been a phenomenal season, more than double our harvest from last year,” he said. Still, this year’s catch is only a fraction of historical harvests from the middle part of the 20th century, when healthy oyster reefs remained in the upper part of Mobile Bay. Those numbers steadily declined from the 1950s onward and crashed after 2000, with the state unable to have an oyster season from 2018 to 2019 because of a lack of mature oysters. This year’s wild oyster season opened Oct. 4, and an ending date hasn’t been set. Marine Resources officials told oyster harvesters before this season that they expected this year to be about the same as last year based on preliminary surveys. But a new area that was opened for harvest proved fertile. Refinements to a grid system that helps oyster boats know which areas have been worked thoroughly also helped with the harvest, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Communities across Alaska will have thousands of free at-home COVID-19 test kits to distribute during the holidays, officials said. Sarah Hargrave, Southeast regional public health nurse manager for the state, told KTUU that close to 100,000 kits have been sent across Alaska. Sixteen public health centers in the state will have the kits. School districts have ordered them, as have fire departments and universities. Corey Allen Young, a spokesperson for Mayor Dave Bronson’s office, said Anchorage had secured 25,000 kits from the state that will be available at testing sites and places like libraries. Earlier in the year, the municipality bought 25,000 rapid at-home test kits that it gave to adult living facilities for staff and residents. The City and Borough of Juneau is distributing the at-home kits at its three libraries and at City Hall, among other locations. About 1,100 are being sent from the state to Juneau each week. But health officials estimated Juneau will need double the amount each week in coming months, particularly with an expected omicron variant case surge.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A fire broke out inside a Tucson Walmart on Christmas Eve, forcing the big-box store to close. The Tucson Fire Department said the blaze was reported around 7 a.m. Friday. The first crew on the scene found no visible flames outside. Employees inside led firefighters to the back where fire and smoke were coming from at least three aisles. Firefighters were able to extinguish the flames quickly with the help of a working sprinkler system. Crews remained for several hours to check for hot spots. Fire officials said no one was injured. The cause is under investigation. Photos posted by Tucson Fire’s Twitter account show much of the damage was in aisles carrying paper goods. Completely charred paper plates, bowls and towels are scattered below broken shelves.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:The city Solid Waste Services Department will collect live trees on the curb during the yard waste week through Dec. 30 and Jan. 10-14, said Shari Cooper, communications manager for the city. All ornaments, lights, garland, plastic, tinsel, tree stands and decorations must be removed before a tree is placed on the curb. For those who want to bring the tree as brush to the city landfill, at 5900 Commerce Road, there is a fee of $39.51 plus tax per ton and no minimum fee. For example, Cooper said “if a tree weighed 50 pounds, it would be $1.00-plus tax. Same rules apply of no ornaments, lights, garland, plastic, tinsel and tree stands.” If the tree still has decorations, it will be considered trash, which has a flat fee of $23.48 for pickups. For vehicles pulling a trailer, there will be a $44.11 fee per ton, with a $20 minimum, plus fees and tax.The Solid Waste Services Department will mulch properly disposed of live trees, along with additional yard waste collected during the year, Cooper said.

The zoo announced Satu’s death on social media on Thursday, saying the orangutan’s cause of death was likely to be related to cancer. Satu had been under veterinary care for serious illness, the zoo said, but collapsed and was unable to be resuscitated. The zoo called Satu a “much-loved ape” and “charismatic primate.” Other details were not immediately available. Satu was born at the zoo in 1995. He sired two offspring, a male named Cinta and a female named Aisha. “Satu was known to be patient, curious, engaging and sensitive. He will be greatly missed by the wildlife care specialists, medical team, volunteers, and guests alike,” the zoo said in a statement. The zoo now has three orangutans, Aisha, Karen and Indah, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Bruno, a male orangutan at the Los Angeles Zoo, died earlier this month at 42. Native to the jungles of Indonesia and Malaysia, there are three species of orangutans, all of which are critically endangered.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:A backcountry skier died in an avalanche near Cameron Pass on Christmas Eve, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. The avalanche, which occurred at 10,500 feet on the southeast portion of South Diamond Peak, occurred “1 to 3 feet below the snow surface and was about 250 feet wide.” “The victim’s partner was able to locate him with a transceiver and probe pole and extricate him from the snow, but he did not survive,” the CAIC said in the official incident report. After heavy snowfall in the mountains on Thursday and into Friday morning, the avalanche reportedly broke on a layer of “faceted snow” about 2 p.m. Friday. The skier’s body was located and recovered after dark on Friday night, and his name has not yet been released. The fatality was the first avalanche death in Colorado this snow season. A backcountry skier also died on Diamond Peak in a nearby area during a Dec. 2019 avalanche near the pass, which is about 60 miles up Colorado Highway 14 from U.S. Highway 287. Many parts of the Colorado high country are under avalanche watches or warnings. The area around Cameron Pass and Diamond Peak remains under an Avalanche Watch until at least 8 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 26.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A new study has concluded that licensed child care centers in Connecticut have been missing out on millions of dollars in federal funds for food and nutrition. UConn’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health surveyed more than 230 centers in 2019 about a U.S. Department of Agriculture program that reimburses for food that meets specific nutritional standards. The program supplies qualifying child care programs with nutritious meals and snacks. The researchers found a lack of awareness, lack of knowledge about eligibility and burdensome reporting requirements as factors that weighed against participation. The study estimated more than 20,000 children from low-income homes may have missed out on the program’s benefits and that families could have saved an average of $31 per week per child. More than a third of providers said they thought they weren’t eligible for the program because they didn’t have a sufficient number of low-income children, the study found. But the study also concluded many providers lacked a full understanding of the program and its requirements.\n\nDelaware\n\nCamden:A dozen people were left homeless and two were injured Friday morning after fires struck two separate mobile homes less than 4 miles apart in the Camden area. The Camden-Wyoming Fire Company was first called to the first block of Laws Lane near South State Street at about 4 a.m., Assistant State Fire Marshal Michael Chionchio said. No injuries were reported, but an estimated $100,000 in damage was done to the home, four vehicles and two nearby mobile homes, Chionchio said. The cause of the fire is still unknown. Less than 8 hours later, the Camden-Wyoming Fire Company put out a fire on the 1000 block of Barney Jenkins Road, Chionchio reported. Firefighters found a 44-year-old man and a 58-year-old woman suffering from smoke inhalation and took them to Bayhealth Kent Campus in Dover. The man – who is also being treated for burns – is in “serious condition,” Chionchio said. That fire started when a cigarette caught a bed on fire, Chionchio said. The mobile home did not have any smoke alarms. The Red Cross was called to help the 12 people displaced by the fires.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority bus river suffered minor injuries when a gunshot shattered glass on the bus he was driving near Capitol One Arena on Sunday night, WUSA-TV reported. A spokesperson from WMATA confirmed one of their bus operator on the 70 route was struck by a bullet during the shooting and was treated at the scene. There were no other reported injuries. Officers with the Metropolitan Police Department are seeking the identity of a person they believe is connected to the shooting. Police were called to the 700 block of H. Street Northwest about 6:30 p.m. aftger reports of shots fired in Chinatown near the arena, which was playing host to an NBA game between the Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers. Through surveillance footage, police were able to capture stills of a person they believe is connected to the incident. Anyone with knowledge of the incident is urged to call police at (202) 727-9099 or text the Department’s TEXT TIP LINE at 50411.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Job growth in Florida will outpace the national economy, and unemployment will continue to decline in 2022, according to a new economic forecast for the Sunshine State. Florida’s unemployment rate, which stood at 4.5% in November, is expected to continue falling in 2022, and housing starts will pickup, but not quickly enough to satisfy robust demand in the short run, according to the forecast released earlier this month by the Institute for Economic Forecasting at the University of Central Florida. Inventory for single-family homes is so scarce in Florida that it would take only 1.3 months to use up the current supply of homes at the current rate of demand. Nationally, the supply was at 7.1 months in October. Typically, a six-month supply is considered a healthy and balanced market. In contrasts to the Great Recession more than a dozen years ago, the housing market won’t be an “albatross” around Florida’s economy during the continued recovery from the pandemic, the report said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nValdosta: City and county residents looking to dispose of their old Christmas trees can do so at a recycling event that runs Sunday through Jan. 7. The “Bring One for the Chipper” event is sponsored by the city and Lowndes County. Collected trees, without ornaments and tinsel, will go through a recycling process to make mulch and potting soil, The Valdosta Daily Times reported. City residents can drop off their trees at Mathis Auditorium or place trees by the street on the day of residential sanitation pickup. County residents can drop off trees at Deep South Collection Center, Advanced Disposal Lakes Collection Center or Advanced Disposal Pine Grove Collection Center. Trees dropped off at county sites will be accepted during center hours. For more information or questions, call the City of Valdosta Public Information Office at (229) 259-3548, or Lowndes County Public Information Office (229) 671-2491.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A magnitude-4.9 earthquake struck a submerged volcano south of Hawaii’s Big Island on Friday. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said the temblor hit at 1:32 a.m. about 26 miles southeast of Naalehu, at a depth of 7.5 miles. There were no immediate reports of any damage. The submerged volcano was long been called Loihi, but has since been renamed Kama’ehuakanaloa. Ka Wai Ola, the newspaper of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, reported that Hawaii Board on Geographic Names voted unanimously in July to change the name. Cultural practitioners proposed the renaming after noting use of “Kama’ehu a Kanaloa” in Hawaiian language newspapers from the 19th and early 20th centuries. “Kama’ehu a Kanaloa” refers to any undersea volcano – a child born in Kanaloa, the ocean – the newspaper said, citing Ku’ulei Kanahele of the Edith Kanaka’ole Foundation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Traffic fatalities in Idaho were at a 15-year high in 2021 after declining for four years, according to data from the Idaho Transportation Department. The Idaho Statesman reported preliminary data indicated that through Thursday, there had been at least 258 people killed in crashes this year, the most in any year since 2006. In 2020, 214 people died in traffic accidents. Since 2016, when 253 fatalities were recorded, the figure had declined each year before rising again in 2021. “A lot of people feel it has something to do with the pandemic,” said Bill Kotowski, a grant officer with the Office of Highway Safety. “Anecdotally, if you talk to some of our law enforcement partners … people are speeding more, we’re hearing substance abuse has been an issue during the pandemic.” It’s not only Idaho that is seeing an increase in deaths. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported earlier this year that the first six months of 2021 saw the largest increase in the number of people who died in motor vehicle crashes, with 18.4% more deaths than were recorded over the same period in 2020.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools officials have purchased 100,000 new laptops in anticipation of more students needing to take classes remotely in January if cases of the coronavirus surge. But district officials said they still hope to avoid a system-wide return to remote learning, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Leaders of the nation’s third-largest school district this month asked its Board of Education to spend more on computers than initially planned in an August 2020 agreement that totaled $12 million over three school years. The new plan increases the total to $296 million over three school years. The district also said this week that it purchased another 100,000 laptops for about $39 million. Spokeswoman Sylvia Barragan said that purchase was “in preparation for more classrooms to switch to remote learning if needed amid a possible COVID-19 surge in January.” CEO Pedro Martinez has repeatedly said the district will not close down unless there is a citywide order requiring it and will continue making closure decisions based on individual schools or classrooms. But there is heightened concern about a spike in new coronavirus cases following the district’s winter break and the omicron variant’s arrival.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A film shot in Indianapolis in 1902 that captures a menagerie of Ringling Bros. circus animals parading through the city’s downtown has landed a spot on the National Film Registry. The 3-minute-long silent film, titled “Ringling Bros. Parade Film,” is part of a class of 25 films recently added to the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry. Released by the Selig Polyscope Company in July 1902, it is the 11th-oldest movie in the registry, the Indianapolis Business Journal reported. It features elephants, camels and caged lions traveling on Capitol Avenue past the Indiana Statehouse before the parade passes along Washington Street past the Indiana Repertory Theatre’s future home. When announcing this year’s class of films on Dec. 14, Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said Black residents seen along the parade route factored in the movie’s selection for the National Film Registry. “African Americans were rarely shown in films of that era, and then only in caricature or mocking depictions,” Hayden said. An Oakland, California, couple who said they found the film in their basement in the 1970s donated it to the Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum in Fremont, California, in 2011.\n\nIowa\n\nClear Lake: A northern Iowa sixth-grader could have enjoyed a windfall after finding a $100 bill, but instead, he decided to use the money to buy Christmas gifts for needy children. The Mason City Globe Gazette reported that Jacob Boller of Clear Lake was on his way home from school earlier this month when he spotted the $100 bill on the ground. His family checked with police and no one reported the missing money. The family waited several days to see if someone came forward, but they didn’t. Boller knew right away he wanted to use the money to help children who might not get Christmas presents. The family went to the store and purchased toys and games, then gave them to a local CPA firm that matched the donations – doubling the amount of goods given out. All told, 14 toys were donated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:A panel of lawmakers charged with distributing the state’s federal COVID-19 aid approved the creation of a $50 million program to give low-income families grants to help students secure books, technology or tutoring to overcome pandemic learning loss. It comes as part of the latest round of aid spending, which totaled more than $150 million, and also includes investments in economic development and broadband. The dollars caame out of more than $1 billion in aid allocated to Kansas from the federal American Rescue Plan Act, which was passed in March. Some members of the Strengthening People and Revitalizing Kansas Executive Committee, a group of lawmakers and business leaders who approve how the federal aid is used, saw the plans as half-baked, however, and raised concerns that it would result in other projects being denied dollars down the line.But Lt. Gov. David Toland, who chairs the SPARK committee, said the policies presented a suite of needed investment. And, most important, it came as an urgent response to Kansans who pushed for the lawmakers to begin pushing money out sooner rather than later.\n\nKentucky\n\nOwensboro: An initiative in Owensboro to connect Black students with industry mentors, their peers and school faculty had a successful first run, officials said. Owensboro Black Expo, Owensboro Public Schools and the Owensboro Community & Technical College partnered to launch the Academic Career Exploration program in August and it just completed its first cohort with positive outcomes, the Messenger-Inquirer reported. The program was offered to Owensboro High School and Owensboro Innovation academy students this year, but plans call for it to expand to the county school system, said Sharmy Davis, program organizer and director of cultural diversity at the community college.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana is doubling cash payments available to poor families through its welfare programs next year, the first increase in more than two decades, the state’s social services department said. Benefits will be boosted to the national average for people receiving cash assistance through the federal Family Independence Temporary Assistance Program and Kinship Care Subsidy Program. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services said the new payment amounts – intended to help families with food, shelter and clothing – will begin in January. “We know there are many more families who could benefit from the programs, not only for the much-needed cash assistance but also for the valuable workforce development and educational opportunities these programs offer. We hope this increase in benefit amounts will attract more people,” agency Secretary Marketa Garner Walters said in a statement. The latest data provided by the department showed 1,484 households receive cash assistance through the Family Independence Temporary Assistance Program and 1,338 households get kinship care subsidies. Those are available to relatives caring for children whose parents don’t live with them. A three-person household that gets $240 in welfare assistance will see that amount grow to the national average of $484, according to the social services agency. People who are under the age of 60 and who aren’t disabled or caring for someone who is disabled are required to work or participate in an education or job training program aimed at helping them find employment. Kinship care subsidies will grow from $222 per child to $450.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Many businesses are scrambling to install gas detectors ahead of Saturday, when a state law goes into effect in response to a 2019 propane blast in Farmington. Detectors must be installed in any room where there’s a gas- or propane-fueled appliance for many businesses, hotels, motels, nonprofit organizations, shelters and rental properties. Those who don’t comply face a $5,000 fine. “It will undoubtedly help protect people with any gas leakage in the buildings. But it’s going to take a while to bring everybody into compliance,” said Jason Grant, of the Portland Fire Department, told WGME-TV. Lawmakers acted after a deadly propane blast in Farmington on Sept. 16, 2019, which killed a firefighter and injured others. The gas detectors are different from fire and smoke detectors. The problem, said Brit Vitalius with the Southern Maine Landlord Association, is that many landlords are just learning of the requirement. “We want our buildings to be safe,” Vitalius said. “But we’re not thrilled with the way that this was just passed at the state level with no education, no outreach, nothing else attached to it to make sure that it’s actually successful.” Local hardware stores say they’re already seeing an increase in purchases.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:Longtime Washington County State’s Attorney Charles P. Strong, 75, is retiring from the legal profession after 49 years. Strong’s last day as state attorney is Friday, leaving with a full year remaining in his term. The circuit court judges are charged with naming a replacement, according to Administrative Judge Brett R. Wilson. He and the other judges were to meet to discuss how to proceed. Wilson said they could immediately appoint a permanent replacement to fill the remainder of Strong’s term or name an interim state attorney who would serve until a permanent replacement is found. He said there has been “some interest” expressed in the vacancy, but he could not elaborate. Strong took a job as a law clerk in the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office and was sworn in as an assistant state attorney there after he passed the bar in 1972. He found that his true interest is in criminal law, and that doing “something for people” as a prosecutor has proven to be satisfying. Strong worked on his most memorable case while he was still a law clerk. He was part of the team that prosecuted Arthur Bremer on charges that he shot Democratic presidential candidate George Wallace in 1972 during a campaign event in Laurel, leaving Wallace paralyzed from the waist down. Bremer was convicted and served 35 years in prison before he was released in 2007.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBeverly: A husband and wife who operate a small farm in Beverly have gone to court to keep their roosters. Brian and Anita Deeley in their complaint filed in Essex Superior Court last week said the city Board of Health overstepped its authority by ordering them to remove the roosters from their 19-acre farm, The Salem News reported Friday.The Deeleys said the city has “intimidated and coerced” them, and the roosters are crucial to the farm for breeding and protecting hens from predators. The city health director ordered the Deeleys to remove the roosters after a neighbor complained about noise and the couple was prohibited from having roosters by a permit issued in 2015. The Board of Health in October denied the Deeleys a new permit that would have allowed them to keep the roosters. The Deeleys in the suit said the power of a local health board is limited when it comes to commercial farms and the “crowing of roosters” does not constitute a nuisance under state law. The suit seeks damages and a reversal of the board’s decision. The city in response said it has the authority to revoke the animal permit for cause and asked that the suit be dismissed.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Michigan Supreme Court is accepting public comment on a proposal to raise dues for most lawyers by $70 a year to $385 or 22%. The State Bar of Michigan has not had a dues increase since 2003. The increase would help “continue the valuable services and resources the Bar provides for its members,” the court said. Lawyers help pay for the operations of the State Bar and the attorney discipline system. The state’s Supreme Court is accepting comments until April 1. It also will hold a public hearing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nHutchinson: A man who attacked a Menards employee after the worker told him to wear a mask and then assaulted a responding police officer with a hammer has been sentenced to a year in prison. Luke Oeltjenbruns, 61, of Hutchinson pleaded guilty to charges of first- and second-degree assault for the April incident. In addition to the prison time, he was ordered to serve 10 years of probation, perform community service, attend therapy and write letters of apology to the victims. Oeltjenbruns is accused of hitting the lumber store employee multiple times in the head with a piece of wood after the employee would not check him out unless he put on a mask. Later, following a slow-speed case in the suspect’s pickup truck, Officer Steven Sickmann got up on the truck’s running board and reached through the window. Oeltjenbruns closed the window on his arm, trapping him, and hit Sickmann in the head with a hammer. Robbie Lynn Oeltjenbruns said during sentencing that her husband suffers from depression, anxiety and PTSD from his time in the military.\n\nMississippi\n\nBelden: The founders of a company that makes custom-fit jeans are trying their hand in the multibillion-dollar bedding and mattress industry. Blue Delta Jeans co-founders Josh West and Nick Weaver are among the investors in Sandman Bedding, a maker of mattresses, mattress toppers and pillows, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. The company is renovating a facility near Belden, representing a $2.3 million investment. Operations are expected to start in January, and the company expects to employ 25 people within a few months. Sandman Bedding will manufacture products for e-commerce and retail, and develop its direct-to-consumer mattress product under the Nest and Wild brand. Sandman Bedding also will design and manufacture sleep products for other brands across the U.S. The Mississippi Development Authority is providing a $75,000 grant to help with building and infrastructure improvements. MDA also certified the company for the Advantage Jobs Rebate Program, which is for eligible businesses that create jobs exceeding the average annual wage of the state or county in which the company locates or expands.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:In the last year, Springfield police have had more than 1,100 reports of stolen catalytic converters, which is up from 408 in 2020 and 95 in the previous four years combined. “It’s been an ongoing issue for well over a year,” Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams said. “It’s not unique to us, this is a nationwide issue as well. Lots of places around the country are dealing with the same thing.” Experts said a significant increase in the prices of the precious metals housed inside of catalytic converters is driving the spike in thefts. The drastic increase in catalytic converter thefts over the past two years has led to a task force being created in Springfield and bills being filed in Jefferson City. But local law enforcement officers said the problems persist. ‘It’s kind of like a little chemistry lab’ Though just one part of a vehicle’s exhaust system, catalytic converters play an integral role in keeping harmful chemicals from being emitted from a car.” Made up of precious metals such as platinum, rhodium and palladium, a catalytic converter takes harmful chemicals such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides and converts them into less harmful chemicals such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water (in the form of steam), according to McLaughlin. According to McLaughlin, the toxic chemicals pass through the precious metals on the inside of the converter — which look like honeycomb made of metal — the precious metals strip the more harmful chemicals out and leave the less harmful ones.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Native Americans in Montana and the third-leading cause of death among all Montana residents in 2020, according to a December Department of Public Health and Human Services report. The report found 1,022 Native Americans in Montana died in 2020, compared to an average of 676 deaths each year during the five previous years (2015 to 2019). Of the 1,022 Native people who died in 2020, 251, or about 25%, died from COVID-19. Heart disease, unintentional injury and cancer were the second-, third- and fourth leading causes of death, respectfully. Forty-seven Native Americans died from diabetes in 2020, 36 died by suicide and 21 died from homicide. Throughout the pandemic, Indigenous communities in Montana have consistently implemented stricter COVID-19 safety protocols than the state, including curfews, remote learning and quarantine orders. Yet, Native Americans have also consistently been over-represented among Montana’s COVID-19 victims. A previous report revealed that between March and October 2020, Native Americans accounted for 19% of Montana’s COVID-19 cases and 32% of the state’s COVID-19 deaths, yet Indigenous people make up 6.7% of Montana’s population.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A child welfare provider that struggled financially as it served Omaha-area families was beset by mounting debt, poor money management and other problems even before it won a state contract, according to an audit by the group’s home state of Kansas. The audit of Saint Francis Ministries released Thursday showed a nonprofit in financial disarray, with managers who spent money on themselves instead of programs and a chief executive at the time who enjoyed lavish trips paid for by the organization, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The audit also stated that Saint Francis has since taken steps to correct those issues. A Saint Francis spokesperson reiterated the organization is now financially stable. “We are proud of the work done in the past year and the cultural changes we have seen at Saint Francis,” Morgan Rothenberger, executive director of marketing and communications, said in an email. “We will continue to be diligent in our efforts to provide healing and hope to children and families, working closely with our community members.” Those recent changes have come amid continued setbacks in Nebraska, where Saint Francis was contracted to oversee the care of abused and neglected children in Douglas and Sarpy counties starting in 2020. St. Francis later conceded it underbid that contract. The state announced earlier this month that it would terminate its contract with Saint Francis Ministries, but continue to use the group for child placement services.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:A series of winter storms blasting cold air and dumping snow in Northern Nevada has affected travel, with mountain passes closed, canceled or delayed flights and state offices shut down. The Nevada Highway Patrol reported several crashes Monday morning. Five flights at Reno Tahoe International Airport were canceled or delayed Monday as weather and COVID-19 have affected travel across the country. Interstate 80 from the Nevada state line to Applegate in California remained closed Monday. The 70-mile stretch was shut down Sunday. U.S. 395 also was closed in Washoe Valley. On Sunday, there were at least two pileups causing injuries and at least six people were transported to hospitals, according to Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District. On Sunday night, Gov. Steve Sisolak mandated that all nonessential state workers stay home. The University of Nevada, Reno and Truckee Meadows Community College also canceled on-campus in-person operations, including classes that are running for a mini-winter break session. A winter storm advisory was in effect until 7 p.m. Monday, with the storm expecting to leave as much as 3 more inches of snow in lower elevations. Cold temperatures are forcast to linger for most of the week. High temperatures on the valley floor are expected to hover in the upper 20s, with lows barely reaching the teens.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Snowmobile riders from outside of New Hampshire will have the chance to explore the more than 7,000 miles of trails in the state during Open Snowmobile Registration Weekend in March. From Friday, March 4, through Sunday, March 6, sleds legally registered in other states and Canadian provinces will be able to operate on the state’s trails. State laws and regulations regarding the operation of snowmobiles will be enforced. “It’s a great opportunity for residents and visitors alike to explore some of the most beautiful parts of the state that can be most easily accessed by snowmobile in the winter,” said New Hampshire Fish and Game Captain Michael Eastman, who coordinates snowmobile and off-highway recreational vehicle enforcement, registration and safety education.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWantage:A young cow that escaped from a New York City slaughterhouse last week has been taken to an animal sanctuary in New Jersey. The (Morristown) Daily Record reported the 400-pound Hereford heifer, estimated to be about 9 months old, ran away from a Queens business Friday. The animal was corralled by rangers later in the day at Flushing Meadows Corona Park. The next day, Skylands Animal Sanctuary and Rescue center in Sussex County posted that “Stacy” was in temporary quarantine at the 230-acre facility in Wantage. “Little Stacy is doing well, getting used to us as she awaits test results that will hopefully give her the OK to go in with some other kids,” the center said. Director Mike Stura said the heifer will then join 93 other bovines among the 450 permanent residents at the center. Skylands said it offers homes to animals “from slaughterhouses, live markets, farms, extreme neglect, abuse, religious ceremonies, abandonment and are even found wandering streets.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A suspect has been arrested in the shooting of a bear with a bow and arrow near Taos in October. The Albuquerque Journal reported Friday a man was charged in Taos Magistrate Court with unlawful killing of big game by shooting from the road and failing to tag the bear, both misdemeanors. The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish said last month it was investigating the Oct. 29 incident in Arroyo Seco. Bears are a protected species in New Mexico, but bear hunting was allowed in that area at the time of killing, officials said previously. But the newspaper reported court documents stated the Taos-area man shot the bear, which was in a tree, with a bow and arrow, and then shot it a second time after a bystander told him to “shoot it again” so it wouldn’t suffer. The man then “left the area where the bear was killed and made no attempt to retrieve the bear,” authorities alleged. The next day the Taos Volunteer Fire Department removed the bear from the tree with a ladder truck.\n\nNew York\n\nRed Hook: Red Hook has joined a list of Dutchess County municipalities with laws in place regulating short-term rentals. The Red Hook Town Board on Wednesday unanimously passed a local law that limits the number of days hosts can rent their space, requires permits when hosting and specifies rules for what sort of renting is allowed in each zoning district. The law was passed after weeks of negotiation, public comment and resistance from some hosts. Similar laws have been passed in Beacon, Clinton, Pawling, Rhinebeck and Milan. Other Dutchess areas, including Poughkeepsie and Pine Plains, are considering following suit. Beacon is planning to revisit its regulations to potentially add limitations next year. The regulations are intended to keep neighborhoods from filling up with houses and apartments that are rented for part of the year with transient guests and sometimes no homeowner on site. Town officials said they can help ensure housing is not bought specifically for short-term rental use, at a time when there is a growing need for affordable apartments and homes. The laws are also meant to legalize short-term rentals through appropriate zoning while keeping a check on nuisances such as “party houses” and unsafe conditions. In Red Hook, rentals limited to one bedroom are being permitted in all zoning districts, and are limited to 210 days a year. Other rentals outside of dense residential neighborhoods are permitted for more than one bedroom, as long as they are the primary residence of the host, and are limited to 120 days a year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nLinville:Firefighters spent Christmas Day protecting a small neighborhood from a 350-acre forest fire that has closed popular trails in the Lost Cove Wilderness Study Area near Wilson Creek and Grandfather Mountain. First reported on Christmas Eve, the fire was 20% contained as of Monday, according to the U.S. Forest Service. It was burning in the Grandfather Ranger District in Avery County near Bee Mountain, about 10 miles southeast of Linville. Twenty U.S. Forest Service firefighters are working to improve fire lines, said Lisa Jennings, recreation and trails program manager with the Forest Service. The fire is suspected to be human-caused, with no reported lightning strikes recently, though Jennings said the cause of the fire is still under investigation. Recent rain dampened the fire some and more rain is expected Wednesday for the area, keeping humidity levels high, she said. All roads, including Roseboro Road, which connects the area to Linville, and Brown Mountain Beach Road, which follows Wilson Creek, are open, Jennings said, but several trailheads accessed via Roseboro and Pineola roads are closed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Wayne Stenehjem, a Republican who is the longest-serving attorney general in state history, said he will not seek reelection in 2022. Stenehjem, 68, said at a news conference he plans to retire to spend more time with his wife, the Bismarck Tribune reported. “I have had over the years many, many difficult decisions, but none really as difficult as this one,” he said. Stenehjem first took office in 2001 and has held it for six terms. His career in North Dakota politics has spanned more than four decades, starting with his election to the House in 1976. He ran for governor in 2016 but lost in the GOP primary to Doug Burgum, who went on to become governor. Stenehjem carried his last election in 2018 with nearly 68% of the vote. His term will conclude at the end of next year. His departure was expected to set off a scramble among Republicans vying for the statewide office next year. Among those considering a run are North Dakota district Judge Wade Webb and former U.S. Attorney Drew Wrigley, KFGO-AM reported.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron:Citing “an abundance of caution,” the Akron Symphony Orchestra said it is rescheduling two concerts as COVID-19 cases rise in northern Ohio. The Baroque Virtuosos, originally scheduled for Jan. 15 at E.J. Thomas Hall, is being moved to 8 p.m. May 14. The planned Gospel Meets Symphony, scheduled for Feb. 12, will be held on at 7:30 p.m.June 18 at E.J. Thomas Hall. The orchestra’s other concerts on the schedule have not been changed. Tickets already purchased for the impacted concerts will be honored on the new dates. Vouchers for other concerts are available through the orchestra’s box office. Visit AkronSymphony.org for more information.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge has granted a stay of execution for a death-row inmate who was scheduled to receive a lethal injection in March. In his order last week, U.S. District Judge Stephen Friot agreed to stay the execution of 49-year-old James Coddington. The order reinstates Coddington as a plaintiff in a case with other death-row inmates who are challenging Oklahoma’s three-drug lethal injection protocol. A trial in that case is scheduled to begin before Friot in February. Coddington initially was removed from that case because he failed to select an alternative method of execution that Friot required of the plaintiffs. But Coddington’s attorneys were able to prove to the judge that Coddington had selected firing squad as an alternative method. Firing squad is one of several authorized execution methods under Oklahoma law, along with lethal injection, electrocution and nitrogen hypoxia. Lethal injection has been the only method used in Oklahoma since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976. Coddington’s public defender declined to comment on the judge’s order, and a spokeswoman for state Attorney General John O’Connor didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State health officials and disability advocates have come to an agreement on a dispute over admission to the state’s psychiatric hospital. In court records filed Dec. 17, plaintiffs Disability Rights Oregon and Metropolitan Public Defender with the Oregon Health Authority agreed to have an outside expert study long running capacity issues, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Even before the pandemic, many people in the criminal justice system with a mental illness who needed hospital level care waited for that care while in local jails. Advocates and state health officials said staffing issues, hospital management and a surge in demand have exacerbated the crisis. Lawmakers and advocates for people with disabilities have said the state needs more community based treatment and housing options to prevent people from reaching a crisis, or to support them as they leave hospital care. Dr. Debra Pinals has been hired as a neutral party to study the hospital and provide recommendations on how to alleviate the hospital’s capacity problems, officials said. Pinals works for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services as the medical director of behavioral health and forensic programs. Friday’s agreement also limited the amount of time people found guilty except for insanity will wait for admission to four months.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBellefonte: A church with a 221-year history held its final service and is scheduled to close at the end of the year because of declining membership and attendance. The First Presbyterian Church of Bellefonte, which is nearly as old as the borough itself, held the final scheduled service on Christmas Eve. The church was established in 1800 by the same men who founded Bellefonte in 1795 at a time when there were only 16 states and counted among its members two former Pennsylvania governors. The church met at the courthouse for almost two decades and then in a stone edifice; the current structure was built shortly after the Civil War. Dannaker estimated the church had about 40 members before the pandemic, a number that is down to about 25, and had no in-person worship from March 2020 until Easter Sunday. When Dannaker joined 34 years ago, she said, there were about 200 people in attendance then. Pam Benson, 77, a member for 73 years, said that when she was born during World War II, many businesses were closed Sunday and few events were scheduled. She said she also believes fewer parents have insisted that their children attend services and that churches haven’t always been competitive in recruiting new members. “It was so different. It was just what you did. Unless you were really sick, it was just what you did,” Benson said. “It’s just change, it’s progression. It’s what happens. Not that I like it, but it is what it is.” The 15,000-square-foot church is scheduled to close for the last time Dec. 31. Dannaker said the future of the building hasn’t been determined.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island Hospital is getting $600,000 in federal funding to launch the state’s first Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner program, according to the state’s congressional delegation. The hospital was awarded the funding from the Department of Justice’s Office of Victims of Crime, the state’s congressional delegation said. The federal funding will enable Rhode Island to provide equitable access to quality, trauma-informed medical and forensic care for survivors of sexual assault and support community resources that prioritize healing and justice, the delegation said. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said the grant will ensure evidence is properly collected and analyzed, thereby reducing trauma for sexual assault survivors and strengthening the state’s capacity to effectively prosecute cases. Rhode Island Hospital is part of the Lifespan health system. U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said Lifespan is building a new program to provide comprehensive support to survivors of sexual assault.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nRidgeland: A Jasper County town is being paid nearly $920,000 by the South Carolina prison system to end a four-year dispute over a facility’s water and sewer bill. Corrections Director Bryan Stirling told the State Fiscal Accountability Authority earlier this month that he didn’t want to pay the bill, but he felt like he had no choice because state law allows the increase. “They literally came to us and said they’d shut the water off,” Stirling said, a move that would cause chaotic and dangerous conditions behind bars. Stirling asked the five-member authority that oversees agency spending, made up of the governor, treasurer, comptroller general, House Ways and Means chairman and Senate Finance chairman, to put pressure on legislators to do something to prevent another town from taking advantage of the state. Ridgeland Town administrator Dennis Averkin declined to comment, telling The Post and Courier the lawsuit over the water rates was still pending.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Staff members and guests at a homeless and transitional facility each received $100 bills for Christmas from an anonymous donor. The St. Francis House in Sioux Falls has 90 residents, one of whom is recovering from cancer and suffering from Parkinson’s disease. St. Francis House Executive Director Julie Becker said it was humbling to be selected by the donor and delivered a message when handing out the bills, KELO-TV reported. “Please know that this donor wanted to let all of you know that you guys are all special people, okay?” Becker said. “Your circumstances do not define you. You are all here for a reason, and it’s all different, and everybody is working their plan to get on to a better way of life.” She also asked them to continue paying it forward, such as putting a couple of bucks in the Salvation Army kettle or buying someone a cup of coffee.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The George Jones – a museum, restaurant and venue dedicated to the late country music legend – permanently closed its doors, according to a social media post from the business. A post to Instagram Dec. 19 indicated that COVID-19 hurdles, workforce shortages and the aftermath of last year’s Christmas morning bombing contributed to the closure of the museum on Second Avenue in the bustling Lower Broadway entertainment district. “It has been a difficult [two] years for so many — our company has been no different,” the post read, adding: “As many business owners know, between the workforce shortages and difficulty with consistency of products, it is a challenge day to day (to say the least) to make a business viable.” With artifacts and interactive displays, the museum celebrated Jones – a rich-voiced Country Music Hall of Fame singer known for “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” “The Race Is On,” and countless others. The attraction featured outfits, instruments, awards, platinum albums and Jones’ famous John Deere riding lawnmower. Museum items will be handled with care, according to the closure announcement; a new location for the exhibit is yet to be announced. The George Jones opened in 2015, two years after the singer’s death.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi:The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said last week it is looking for public input to proposed rules changes for spotted seatrout on the middle and lower coast. A release from the department stated the proposed rules would reduce the spotted seatrout bag limit to three fish and restrict the allowable size to 17 to 23 inches for two years. “The goal of this rule is to leave more spawning fish in the water for two spawning seasons in order to help the populations recover quickly from the 2021 winter storm,” the release said. The changes would affect Matagorda Bay, San Antonio Bay, Aransas Bay, Corpus Christi Bay and the Upper and Lower Laguna Madre systems. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission will vote on the adoption of the rules during its January meeting.\n\nUtah\n\nPark City: Officials said 167 skiers were stranded for several hours before being rescued from a broken lift at Deer Valley Resort in Park City. Officials said the Carpenter Express chairlift experienced a mechanical failure about 2:38 p.m. Friday, KUTV reported. Mountain operations staff got the chairlift moving again and implemented lift evacuation procedures by 3:15 p.m., officials said. Some skiers tweeted the ski patrol started evacuating people about an hour after the lift initially stopped running. Deer Valley ski patrol, mountain operations, lift maintenance, lift operations, mountain hosts and ski school responded to the incident and successfully evacuated all of the skiers by 5:20 p.m. Deer Valley officials said. Video from skiers posted to social media showed staff members using ropes to help lower stranded skiers to the ground. Deer Valley officials thanked their staff for their efforts and said their work was “heroic.” The Carpenter Express chairlift is located at Deer Valley’s Snow Park Base. It transports skiers to Snow Park-area ski runs and provides access to ski runs connecting to the midmountain area at Silver Lake.\n\nVermont\n\nLyndon: The Select Board in Lyndon has tripled the fines for height and weight limit violations on two covered bridges, hours after the latest vehicle collision with one of the bridges. Drivers that exceed the limits will face fines of $5,000 for a first offense, $10,000, for a second offense and $15,000 for third and subsequent offenses, the Caledonian Record reported. The increased fines are meant as a deterrent and to fund mitigation measures for the Miller’s Run bridge, which was struck for the sixth time this year on Dec. 20, the newspaper reported. The town plans to install steel I-beam structures at either end of the bridge to block tall vehicles. The town is also considering adding surveillance cameras to capture offenders’ license plates. The change in fines will go into effect in 60 days.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office said there have been 90 homicides in the city in 2021, the most of any year since there were 95 in 2004, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Meanwhile, 13 people have been killed in Richmond in December, including eight slain in an eight-day period. Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Learned Barry said the city has seen 24 more homicides this year than in 2020, and he drew a comparison to a 10-year stretch spanning the 1980s and 1990s when Richmond had 100 or more murders every year. “We have a problem again,” said Barry, a veteran homicide prosecutor. “That becomes the No. 1 problem for the city.” In the past three years, at least 98 children under age 18 have been shot in the city. Of those, 14 died. At least nine people under age 18 have been charged in homicide cases this year, compared to just five for 2019 and 2020, according to police statistics. “We’ve got to stop this because our children are dying,” said Tracey Scott, one of many community advocates to speak up during a recent meeting aimed at stemming the city’s gun violence.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Emergency warming shelters were opened throughout western Washington and Oregon as temperatures plunged into the teens and forecasters said an arctic blast would last for several days. Utilities reported about 6,000 customers without power in western Oregon Monday morning and about 3,300 in western Washington. Sunday’s snow showers blew into the Pacific Northwest from the Gulf of Alaska, dumping up to 6 inches across the Seattle area. More snow is predicted for Thursday, but probably not quite as much. More than a foot was reported near Port Angeles across the Puget Sound on the Olympic Peninsula. Icy roads will make the commute challenging in Seattle. Frigid temperatures in the region broke daily cold records. The National Weather Service said Seattle’s low Sunday was 20 degrees F, breaking a mark set in 1948. Bellingham was 9 degrees F, three degrees colder than the previous record set in 1971. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan signed an emergency order on Christmas Eve that allows for incentive pay for city workers who will be providing direct services during the cold snap.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new equestrian campground with a covered corral and 20 stalls is being developed at North Bend State Park, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. Department of Resources Director Stephen McDaniel announced the project, which he said was prompted by a surge of interest in trail riding during a recent meeting of the Shiloh Trail Riders. When the project is completed, McDaniel said, it will be the largest of three equestrian campgrounds in West Virginia. The new campground will include a loop of 12 pull-in campsites large enough to accommodate campers and trailers with power and water hookups. It is being built adjacent to the Cokeley Campground at North Bend, and visitors to the campground will be able to use the bathhouse there.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The National Weather Service has confirmed a rare December wind storm spawned eight tornadoes across west-central Wisconsin. The Dec. 15 storm swept across multiple states. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Sunday the storm produced three tornadoes rated as EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, three EF-1 tornadoes and two EF-0 tornadoes. The EF-2s touched down in Clark County and in Stanley, a city in Chippewa and Clark counties. An EF-1 touched down in Homer, Minnesota, before ending on a Mississippi River island on the Wisconsin side. The other EF-1s touched down in Levis, along the Trempealeau and Jackson County line and in Clark County. The EF-0s touched down in Eau Claire County and in the village of Trempealeau. The Enhanced Fujita Scale is a numerical scale that measures a tornado’s wind speed and destructive power. An EF-2 packs winds ranging from 113 mph to 157 mph. An EF-1 can produce winds between 73 mph and 112 mph. An EF-0 can produce winds ranging from 40 mph to 72 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Having the desire to take on a nontraditional workforce, Justin Smith became the first woman to graduate from Laramie County Community College’s new commercial driver’s license program last summer. She began her journey with the hope of finding a self-sustaining job that would allow her to spend more time with her two daughters, and find work-life balance. Before she even attended LCCC for the training, she had a job lined up with a local wheat company, backed by the efforts of Climb Wyoming. Now, she has her own semi truck and runs a business, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. “You just got to be patient,” she said. “But anything can be done.” Smith was among the first students in the community college’s driving program, which was created after Gov. Mark Gordon approached LCCC President Joe Schaffer in the wake of the workforce shortage. The first class was offered in March, and she was one of 10 students who completed the program in June.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/03/12/corpus-christi-coronavirus-updates-heres-latest-covid-19/5030375002/", "title": "Corpus Christi coronavirus: Past coverage of COVID-19", "text": "Staff reports\n\nCorpus Christi Caller-Times\n\nMarch 12, 2020 Updated May 20, 2020, 1:57 p.m. ET\n\nUPDATE 5/20/2020 : Breaking news regarding COVID-19 in the Coastal Bend will continue to be posted on caller.com, but will no longer be added to this running update page.

On the slopes, they are 19 again, unburdened by time. They were, like many skiers, unhappy with new parking charges at the most convenient lot at Northstar California Resort. But unlike the others who just muttered or cursed under their breath, they've taken their displeasure to the court of law.\n\nTheir goal is to force the resort's parent company to provide free parking in their preferred lot for the remainder of the season, money in excess of $200,000 in damages each and reimbursement for court costs. They argue Northstar planned to charge for parking but didn't reveal that information until after they'd bought their season passes.\n\nKroll and Code say the damages are necessary to deter Vail Resorts Inc., a company valued at nearly $10 billion, and other large corporations from using \"their superior economic power to bully and defraud their customers.\"\n\nRussell Carlton, a spokesman for Vail Resorts, declined to comment on the suit.\n\nHoliday cards for Borderline survivors\n\nBake some \"kookis.\" Play with a best friend.

That's a growth of more than 85% since 2013.\n\nThe spike in pension payouts is in big part driven by retirement packages for members of police and fire unions — career safety employees often earn 90% of their peak pay if they were hired before 2013. That virtually assures them of earning pensions of over $100,000. And many retire at age 50 or 55.\n\nFor comparison's sake, consider that the highest Social Security payment someone can collect is just over $45,000 per year and that's if they retire at age 70.\n\nHow does this affect me? The pension costs for many jurisdictions in the state are the fastest-increasing cost. That's money that might otherwise go to paving roads, hiring more police officers or keeping the library open. The state auditor recently found that nearly half of cities in California are at \"high risk\" of not being able to afford their pension costs without cutting services or adding new taxes.\n\nIn California is a roundup of news from across USA TODAY Network newsrooms.

Like Shaggy’s, Paradise does a fantastic job incorporating the beach into its identity, but it’s also one of the best places on the beach to catch live music.\n\nWater tours and rentals\n\nWhy celebrate by land when you could celebrate by sea? Boat tours and rentals are a great way to really soak up the atmosphere. You can rent everything from personal watercraft to pontoons, head out on a sunset or dolphin cruise and even gets a bird's eye view of the beach while parasailing.\n\nCondor Sailing\n\nCaptain Kirk offers a unique sailing experience aboard the 40-foot Condor racing trimaran, Dare II, on beautiful Pensacola Bay.

It's a great spot to fish, swim and picnic, and it has several amenities including parking, restrooms, pavilions and beach showers.\n\nExplore Fort Pickens\n\nNote: The Fort Pickens Visitor Center is closed until further notice for repairs. Fort Barrancas is also closed until May.\n\nFort Pickens is one of several Third System forts that were built along the United State’s coastline to protect important waterways and ports. Its purpose was to defend Pensacola Bay and the Pensacola Navy Yard and Depot from foreign attacks, according to the National Parks Service.\n\nConstruction of the fort was completed in 1834, and it remained in use until 1947. In 1899, a fire broke out in the fort. The fire reached Bastion D’s magazine, which held 8,000 pounds of powder, causing a massive explosion. The house-sized hole left in the wall is a popular spot today.\n\nThere are several activities and facilities visitors can experience like the fort itself, Battery Cooper and Battery Worth. Tent and RV camping is available at designated campgrounds and there are parking lots with beach access.\n\nThe park store has a wide range of books, educational games, posters and other items. The discovery center is the perfect spot to learn about the fort's history and the surrounding environment. And the Gulf-facing Langdon Beach Pavilion is the perfect spot for a more private beach experience.\n\nEntrance fees are $15 per person (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.), a vehicle pass is $25 and an annual park pass is $45.

While it was ultimately proven to be a hoax, the theme has stuck around.\n\nThe mini golf course recently reopened after closing for renovations. Patrons can spend time playing arcade games like Halo: Fireteam Raven and air hockey, plus there's ice cream, shakes and more.\n\nLearn more: www.ufospensacolabeach.com\n\nLaguna's Beach Bar + Grill\n\n460 Pensacola Beach Blvd.\n\nLaguna's Beach Bar and Grill is a little bit of everything — literally.\n\nYou'll find family-friendly activities, exceptional cuisine and ice-cold drinks. The establishment boasts a 600-foot stretch of pristine beachfront, featuring tikis and Adirondack chairs and offers attractions like go-karts, a three-story ropes course, a splash pad, four 30-foot tall clip n' climb climbing structures, zip rail, parasailing, jet ski rentals, pontoon boat rentals, dolphin cruises and more.\n\nThe restaurant also offers an array of entertainment options, including live music every weekend during the summer, the only brick-oven pizza kitchen on the island and TVs for games.

It's grown so much that we've been listed, year after year, as one of the top cities to live in throughout Florida and the country as a whole.\n\nWe couldn't possibly include everything to check out, but here's a few links to continue your exploration:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/road-trips/2015/07/23/things-discover-flagstaff/30484475/", "title": "Discover Flagstaff: Aspens, cheese crisps and Route 66", "text": "Roger Naylor\n\nSpecial for The Republic\n\nJuly 23, 2015, 2:53 p.m. ET\n\nAll 18-year-olds think they know everything. In my case, it actually was true.\n\nAt that age, I knew I was going to be a writer and I knew I was going to live in Arizona. Nothing else mattered. I had decided on my profession a few years earlier, the first time I read Mark Twain. I chose my home just days after arriving in Flagstaff as a wide-eyed freshman attending Northern Arizona University. It was August 1975.\n\nNext month I celebrate 40 years of being head over heels in love with this remarkable state. And it all started in Flagstaff, a mountainous and funky little town. Flag has grown considerably in the past four decades but is still an eclectic blend of college students, cowboys, artists, river runners and ski bums. Here are a few of my favorite Arizona things I discovered in Flagstaff.\n\nAspen enchantment\n\nBecause I arrived from Ohio, mountains were a whole new experience for me. The San Francisco Peaks loom above the city, the hulking remains of an eroded stratovolcano. I had seen woodlands and forests before, but ponderosa pines were a welcome twist. Sticking my nose in the rough folds of the bark and getting a whiff of vanilla made every hike seem like a saunter through some enchanted cookie store.\n\nRELATED: Chiricahua National Monument: Born in volcanic fire​\n\nYet the aspens intrigued me more. I had never seen anything so strikingly uniform in nature: rows of vertical trunks bunched close together to form a pale wall. They looked like they could have been plucked from the pages of a Tolkien book. And aspens have a relationship with the wind unlike other trees. They give voice to the slightest breeze. More than a forest, aspens are a symphony. Their leaves clatter happily to create a velvet crescendo, a shimmery celebration. It’s the sound your heart makes when you run into an ex-lover on a day when you just happen to look fantastic.\n\nThe first trail I remember hiking in Arizona is Veit Springs Loop. It’s still a favorite aspen hike. The 1.5-mile trail begins as a gentle climb along an old jeep road to a small preserve. This 160-acre tract was homesteaded in 1892 by Ludwig Veit. It’s now managed by Arizona Game and Fish Department and is known as the Lamar Haines Memorial Wildlife Area. The road soon narrows to a path and reaches a fork at 0.2 mile. Take the loop clockwise. Elk and deer are common sights in mornings and evenings.\n\nJust before reaching a plaque honoring Haines, a Flagstaff educator and environmentalist, a spur trail leads to the tumbledown remains of Veit’s cabin and two small spring houses. Follow the cliff around to the left to see a few red-orange pictographs, estimated to be more than 1,000 years old.\n\nFrom Flagstaff, drive 7 miles north on U.S. 180 to Snowbowl Road and turn right. Travel 4.4 miles and watch for a small parking area on the right.\n\nIf the parking lot is full, you can still get your aspen fix. Drive another 0.8 mile to Aspen Corner, marked by a split-rail fence, and stretch your legs on that path for a nice mix of forest and sprawling mountain meadows.\n\nDetails: 928-774-5045, www.azgfd.gov.\n\nSay cheese\n\nMy college girlfriend was an Arizona native, born in Chandler. One afternoon we walked to a house on the edge of campus where a Mexican woman ran a small eatery out of her kitchen. There was one table. My girlfriend ordered something called a cheese crisp. It cost 50 cents.\n\nWhat arrived was a rather bland-looking yellow wheel that turned out to be one of the most delicious things I had ever eaten. How could something so utterly simple — a flour tortilla swabbed with a little butter and grated cheese and baked at a volcanically high temperature — be so delectable? I lost touch with my college sweetheart some 38 years ago, but I am forever in her debt for introducing me to this culinary delicacy. It should be our official state appetizer.\n\nRELATED: New hiking trails at Lake Pleasant Regional Park​\n\nOne of my favorite cheese crisps can be found at Salsa Brava in Flagstaff. Served on a tortilla the size of a hubcap, baked to crispy perfection, it’s a big plate of ooey, gooey cheesy goodness. I often eat a Cheese Crisp Grande as my meal. It comes topped with black beans, green chile, tomatoes, onions and cilantro. Salsa Brava has been featured on the popular television show “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.”\n\nDetails: 2220 E. Route 66. 928-779-5293, www.salsabravaflagstaff.com.\n\nKicking it on Route 66\n\nThe first time I set foot on Historic Route 66, Flagstaff’s main drag, was during college. To be honest, it only mildly sparked my interest at the time but it later became a genuine passion.\n\nRoute 66 was established in November 1926, stretching from Chicago to Los Angeles. Arizona contains the longest unbroken stretch of Route 66 still in existence, 158 miles from west of Ash Fork to the California state line. The only national park the Mother Road passes through is the Petrified Forest.\n\nMost importantly, Arizona is the state that saved Route 66.\n\nRELATED: Pearl Harbor spy was detained at Triangle T Ranch\n\nU.S. 66 was decertified in 1985. All signs were taken down and it was removed from maps. It ceased to exist. Through the work of a handful of Seligman residents, Arizona became the first state to dedicate a stretch of the old highway as Historic Route 66, beginning the preservation effort that has encompassed the entire road. Every other state followed our blueprint.\n\nThere are lots of Route 66 highlights in Flag, but one of my favorites is the most obscure. It’s a 770-foot-long slab of pavement that you can no longer drive on.\n\nThrough the years, sections of the road were realigned as needed. The city preserved part of a 1947 segment and threaded it into the Flagstaff Urban Trails System. Sitting in the shadow of Mount Elden just east of Fanning Road, the old piece of highway parallels bustling Historic Route 66 and includes three picnic tables, a ramada and informational signs. It’s open to pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\nBest access is to park across the road in Santa Fe Plaza. If you’re in a picnic mood, grab a sandwich and homemade dessert at Jitters Lunchbox, a new cafe in the plaza, then stroll across the street and snag a table. It’s a nice place to sit and ponder the journey.\n\nDetails: 3504 E. Route 66. 928-526-3277, www.jitterslunchbox.com.\n\nI’m looking forward to the next 40 years. If I was such a know-it-all at 18, I should be a certifiable genius at 98.\n\nFind the reporter at www.rogernaylor.com.\n\nFlagstaff", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/23"}]}

Typically, about to six or seven head-coaching posts come open each year, though several recent offseasons have seen even more extensive overhauls. With three teams already having moved on, it's a good bet that more action is still to come. And even with several reports indicating that not many coaches are distinctly on thin ice, this stage almost annually has a way of stirring up a few surprises.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports will have all the latest updates from throughout Monday, so check back for all the latest:\n\nTodd Bowles makes his case to stay\n\nAfter the Tampa Bay Buccaneers saw their four-year reign atop the NFC South end in Week 18, Todd Bowles still has yet to meet with ownership about his future.\n\nBut the Buccaneers coach stated his case on Monday.\n\n\"I’ve earned the chance,\" Bowles said in an end-of-season news conference. \"I’ve won three straight division titles so that says at lot as far as I’m concerned.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers won their regular-season finale with the Panthers, but Carolina won the division after the Atlanta Falcons' victory over the New Orleans Saints created a three-way tie atop the NFC South.\n\nRaheem Morris could get another shot\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons' decision to dismiss him might not mean that Raheem Morris is kept out of the head-coaching ranks in 2026.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans plan to interview the former Falcons coach, according to ESPN's Peter Schrager.\n\nThe Titans are moving quickly to set up interviews with candidates, with reports indicating that Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Indianapolis Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo and Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph on the team's list.\n\nMike McDaniel seemingly safe in Miami\n\nIn a 24-hour window full of coaching news, the Miami Dolphins have been an outlier.\n\nWhile other franchises moved swiftly to either dismiss their head coach or confirm that they were moving ahead, the Dolphins have not publicly addressed the status of Mike McDaniel. On Monday, the coach indicated that no news is good news.\n\n“My understanding is I’m the head coach of the Miami Dolphins until told otherwise,\" McDaniel told reporters.\n\nMcDaniel said he would be part of the process to select the Dolphins' next general manager after the team parted ways with Chris Grier at midseason. The final decision, however, will be made by owner Stephen Ross.\n\nKevin Stefanski already a hot commodity in coaching searches?\n\nKevin Stefanski might not need to wait long for his next head-coaching opportunity to materialize.\n\nAfter being let go by the Cleveland Browns on Monday, Stefanski is expected to speak with the Atlanta Falcons, New York Giants and Tennessee Titans about their coaching vacancies, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nA two-time NFL Coach of the Year, Stefanski is one of the rare proven commodities in this year's pool of coaching candidates.\n\nFalcons start process in coaching search\n\nLess than 24 hours after firing Raheem Morris, the Falcons are moving on with their coaching search.\n\nThe team on Monday requested an interview with Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak and Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver, according to multiple reports.\n\nWith the Seahawks on a bye, Kubiak is permitted to interview with teams this week.\n\nThe Falcons have gotten an up-close look at Kubiak's offenses on multiple occasions. In early December, Seattle rolled to a 37-9 win over Atlanta. The Falcons also squared off against Kubiak's offenses twice in 2024, when he was offensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints.\n\nWeaver was also on the Falcons' interview list in 2024, when the team eventually hired Morris.\n\nJonathan Gannon fired by Cardinals\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals are moving on from coach Jonathan Gannon after three seasons, the team announced Monday.\n\nGannon posted a 15-36 record, with Arizona dropping 14 of its last 15 games after a 2-0 start.\n\nThe Cardinals had been a popular pick to enjoy a breakthrough season in 2025 after an 8-9 finish a year prior. Instead, Arizona posted the worst point differential (-133) of any NFC team and finished the season with 24 players on injured reserve.\n\nThe move could be the first shake-up in an offseason that could also see the team move on from quarterback Kyler Murray, who was shut down late in the season with a foot injury.\n\nRaiders fire Pete Carroll after one season\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders are starting from scratch again.\n\nThe team on Monday fired Pete Carroll after a 3-14 season that landed it the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\n\"The Las Vegas Raiders have relieved Pete Carroll of his duties as head coach. We appreciate and wish him and his family all the best,\" the team said in a statement. \"Moving forward, General Manager John Spytek will lead all football operations in close collaboration with Tom Brady, including the search for the club's next coach. Together, they will guide football decisions with a shared focus on leadership, culture, and alignment with the organization's long-term vision and goals.\"\n\nCarroll, 74, had remained resolute that he wanted to remain with the team and wasn't contemplating retirement.\n\n“Nobody is talking to me about that,” he said. “I haven’t said a word about that.”\n\nGiants stick with Joe Schoen\n\nThe New York Giants won't be undergoing a full reset in 2026.\n\nJoe Schoen will remain the team's general manager, the Giants announced Monday.\n\nThe Giants fired Brian Daboll in November and kept Schoen, but the general manager's standing seemed to be uncertain down the stretch. On Monday, however, New York reiterated its commitment to Schoen.\n\n\"As previously stated, Joe Schoen will remain our General Manager and continue to lead our football operations and the search for our next head coach,\" co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch said in a statement. \"Continuity and stability in the front office is important to our progress.\n\n\"We believe in our young core of talent, which we can build around for future success.\"\n\nZac Taylor staying put with Bengals\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals missed out on the postseason for the third consecutive year, but Zac Taylor is sticking around as head coach.\n\nTaylor and Duke Tobin will both remain with the team in 2026, the team announced Monday.\n\n\"Our focus is on building a team that can consistently compete at the highest level, with the goal of winning championships,\" Bengals owner Mike Brown said in a statement. \"After thoughtful consideration, I am confident that Duke Tobin and Zac Taylor are the right leaders to guide us forward. They have proven theycan build and lead teams that compete for championships. We trust their plans expect to return to our desired level of success.\"\n\nTitans' coaching search begins with multiple interview request\n\nWith an extensive jump on the field in their coaching search, the Tennessee Titans are now taking the first steps toward identifying Brian Callahan's full-time replacement.\n\nThe Titans have requested interviews with Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Indianapolis Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo and Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe firs two moves come as no surprise given the link between the Kansas City coordinators and Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi, who rose through the ranks with the Chiefs from 2009-24 before taking the top job in Tennessee last year.\n\nNagy is seeking his second chance as an NFL head coach after going 34-31 in four seasons with the Chicago Bears.\n\nJoseph is also trying to break back into the head-coaching ranks after serving as the Broncos' leader from 2017-18. With Denver having secured the top seed and a bye, Joseph will be able to interview with teams this week.\n\nKevin Stefanski fired as Cleveland Browns coach\n\nThe first split of Black Monday is here.\n\nKevin Stefanski has been fired by the Cleveland Browns, the team announced.\n\n“We have tremendous gratitude for Kevin’s leadership of the Cleveland Browns over the last six seasons,\" Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam said in a statement. \"He is a good football coach and an even better person. We appreciate all his hard work and dedication to our organization but our results over the last two seasons have not been satisfactory, and we believe a change at the head coaching position is necessary. We wish Kevin, Michelle and the Stefanski family all the best in the future.\"\n\nAndrew Berry will remain in place as general manager and oversee the search for the next head coach.\n\nSpeculation had mounted entering the Browns' season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals that the two-time NFL Coach of the Year would not return for 2026. Stefanski has a career record of 45-56, but he twice took Cleveland to the postseason.\n\n“After six seasons as the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, I leave with an immense sense of gratitude,\" Stefanski said in a statement. \"When I arrived in January of 2020, this organization, this community and Browns fans embraced me and my family with open arms. I cannot express properly in words how good we have been treated. A sincere ‘Thank You’ to everyone who I have been so blessed to work for and with over these six seasons.\"\n\nStefanski could become one of the more enticing candidates on the open market for other teams with a vacancy.\n\nMore changes ahead for Falcons\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons continue to shake up their setup just one day after firing Raheem Morris and Terry Fontenot.\n\nRich McKay will no longer serve as the team's CEO, the Falcons announced Monday. Team president Greg Beadles will add that role to his title.\n\nAdditionally, owner Arthur Blank confirmed that the organization \"will be adding a new president of football from outside the organization.\" Former Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan has widely been reported as a leading candidate for that role.\n\n\"We plan to move quickly on this hire so the new president of football can be fully involved in the selection of our new leaders in the head coach and general manager roles,\" Blank said in a statement.\n\nWhere does John Harbaugh stand with Ravens?\n\nA crushing loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers not only ended the Baltimore Ravens but opened the door to questions about coach John Harbaugh's future with the franchise.\n\nHarbaugh, however, was clear after the game about his wishes.\n\n\"Yeah, I love these guys,\" Harbaugh said when asked if he hoped to return next year.\n\nTwo-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson couldn't process questions about the future in the immediate aftermath of the loss.\n\n“You’re asking me about next year,” Jackson said. “I’m so caught up in what just happened tonight, I can’t focus on that right now. I just told you. I’m stunned right now. I’m still trying to process what’s going on.”\n\nShane Steichen, Chris Ballard spared by Colts\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts didn't provide much of a runway for speculation to linger.\n\nShortly after their season concluded with a 38-30 loss to the Houston Texans, the Colts announced that both coach Shane Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard would return for 2026.\n\nIndianapolis became the first team in 30 years to start 8-2 and miss the playoffs, as the team dropped its final seven games. Daniel Jones' torn Achilles in Week 14 loomed large over the franchise's spiral, with the Colts signing 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers - who had been retired for five years – in a last-ditch attempt to revive its postseason hopes. But the Colts would still miss the playoffs for the fifth straight year.\n\nIndianapolis now enters a challenging offseason with at least some stability. The Colts must decide on the future of Jones, who is set to become a free agent, while also fortifying a roster that will be without a first-round draft pick for the next two years after the midseason trade to acquire cornerback Sauce Gardner.\n\nBlack Monday predictions: What to expect\n\nAhead of a day that's typically heavy on action, USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis provided four predictions for Black Monday.\n\nAt least one of them – regarding a playoff team joining those embracing change – won't be clear until later. But count Davis among the group expecting a quieter Monday than we've seen in years past.\n\nWhich NFL coaches have already been fired entering Black Monday?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/pro/browns/2024/01/17/browns-shake-up-offensive-coaching-staff-including-stump-mitchell-alex-van-pelt-tc-mcartney-nfl-move/72253425007/", "title": "Browns shake up offensive coaching staff, including Alex Van Pelt", "text": "Updated Jan. 17, 2024, 6:08 p.m. ET\n\nBEREA — The Browns are going through an offensive coaching staff shake-up.\n\nA league source confirmed to the Beacon Journal that running backs coach Stump Mitchell has been fired and that tight ends coach T.C.

Proud of my time there.\"\n\nReceiver Michael Woods II also posted on X: \"I appreciate you AVP good luck coach (heart emoji)\"\n\nCoach Kevin Stefanski hinted at the possibility of staff changes during his end-of-the-year press conference on Sunday, a day after the Browns lost to the Houston Texans in the AFC wild card game.

Browns set interview with Titans' Ryan Crow\n\nThere could also been adjustments coming to the defensive staff. Defensive line coach Ben Bloom's responsibilities may be changed, a source confirmed to the Beacon Journal.\n\nThe Browns have receive permission from the Tennessee Titans to interview their outside linebackers coach, Ryan Crow, a source confirmed to the Beacon Journal. Titans beat writer Paul Kuharsky was the first to report their interest in Crow.\n\nCrow, a Bowling Green State University product, would be coming home in a way if he were hired by the Browns. The Findlay native spent 2014-16 at Baldwin Wallace University, the first season as its offensive line coach and the last two as the offensive coordinator.\n\nAfter spending 2017 as a graduate assistant at Ohio State, Crow was hired by the Titans in 2018 as a defensive assistant. He was in that role for two seasons, then spent the 2020 season as an assistant special teams coach before moving on to be the outside linebackers coach the last three seasons.\n\nThe connection between Crow and the Browns is with defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, who spent the previous two seasons as a senior defensive assistant with the Titans.\n\nFormer Panthers running backs coach Duce Staley in for interview\n\nThe Beacon Journal has also confirmed the report by Anderson that Carolina Panthers assistant head coach/running backs coach Duce Staley was in Berea speaking with the Browns. Staley spent 10 seasons as a player in the league, mostly for the Philadelphia Eagles, but also three seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nStaley has been a coach in the NFL since 2011, when he started as a special teams quality control coach with the Eagles. He was the running backs coach for Philadelphia from 2012-20, where he spent five seasons with current Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, while he was also assistant head coach for Philadelphia from 2018-20.\n\nAfter Philadelphia, Staley spent two season as the assistant head coach and running backs coach for the Detroit Lions in 2021-22. He was assistant head coach and running backs coach this season in Carolina under Frank Reich, who was the offensive coordinator for the Eagles during part of Staley's tenure there.\n\nSecond year Browns have made significant changes on staff\n\nIt's the second consecutive offseason Stefanski has shaken up his coaching staff. Last year, he cleaned house on the defensive side, including coordinator Joe Woods, as well as firing special teams coordinator Mike Priefer.\n\nThose moves led to the hiring of Schwartz and assistant head coach/special teams coordinator Bubba Ventrone. Both of those hires paid immediate dividends, with Schwartz turning the Browns into the No. 1-ranked defense in the regular season and Ventrone noticeably improving the overall performance of the special teams.\n\nMitchell, 64, was the last holdover from Kitchens' staff who remained with the Browns. His position group, though, also suffered as significant an injury as any when Nick Chubb was lost for the season with a knee injury in Week 2 at the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWith Chubb, the Browns ranked No. 1 in the league in rushing at 202 yards per game. However, utilizing a committee of backs in Jerome Ford, Kareem Hunt and Pierre Strong Jr. the remainder of the way, they finished the season 12th at 118.6 yards per game.\n\nMcCartney, 34, originally started his NFL career in 2014 as an offensive assistant for Mike Pettine in Cleveland, and returned in a similar role when Stefanski was hired in 2020. He was elevated to tight ends coach in 2022, when Drew Petzing was moved to quarterbacks coach.\n\nThe last two seasons, McCartney oversaw the most consistent growth from tight end David Njoku in the former first-round draft pick's seven-year career. Njoku finished with career highs in catches (81), receiving yards (882) and receiving touchdowns (six), while posting three of his top four career games in terms of receiving yards.\n\nVan Pelt and Stefanski have been tied together since they arrived in Cleveland in 2020. The 53-year-old Pittsburgh native and former NFL quarterback was the de facto quarterbacks coach — outside of the 2022 season — even though he never officially held that title.\n\nVan Pelt was the play-caller for the Browns' AFC wild card win at the Pittsburgh Steelers in January 2021, with Stefanski out with COVID. It's the only time he's handled the play-calling duties during his time in Cleveland.\n\nInjuries to key players the story for Browns offense in 2023\n\nThe Browns ranked 16th in total yards (335.9), 12th in rushing, 19th in passing (217.2) and tied for 10th in points (23.3).\n\nThe Browns offense was ravaged by injuries this season, beyond just Chubb. Quarterback Deshaun Watson missed virtually all of October with a rotator cuff strain, then was lost for the season with a broken glenoid in his throwing shoulder in mid-November.\n\nThey lost right tackle Jack Conklin to a knee injury in the opener, and left tackle Jedrick Wills Jr. was lost in Week 9 to a knee injury. Conklin's backup, Dawand Jones, was also lost to a knee injury suffered in practice leading into a Week 14 win over Jacksonville.\n\nThe Browns ended up starting five quarterbacks — Watson, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, P.J. Walker, Joe Flacco and Jeff Driskel — while starting seven different offensive line combinations. The fifth starting QB, Driskel, and the seventh line combination were due to Stefanski resting most of the Browns' regulars in the regular-season finale at Cincinnati.\n\nChris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com.

Just as importantly, it has elevated Ball to a position of authority nearly equal to what Thompson’s was despite his being passed over for the general manager’s job 17 months ago.\n\nIt was Murphy alone who chose to employ the new structure. He gave Gutekunst and Ball their titles, and hired LaFleur. It is critical to the franchise’s future, not to mention Murphy’s, that the three men below him find a groove together. The team has not had three losing seasons in a row since 1986-88 and another sub-.500 finish could have fans calling for a house cleaning.\n\nHow Murphy arrived at the structure can be traced to the circumstances that followed his decision to remove Thompson from his position for health reasons. The club had never commented on an illness that some say began affecting Thompson as early as 2014, but this week, after his induction into the Packers Hall of Fame, the former general manager revealed he has an autonomic disorder.\n\nThompson did not get into specifics about the symptoms or the cause but said doctors do not think it relates to CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), the brain disorder that has struck scores of former NFL players such as Thompson.\n\nThompson’s illness forced Murphy to act at the end of the 2017 season, the team’s first losing campaign in nine years. His intention was to replace the ailing Thompson with a full-authority general manager, but at some point, he decided the top three positions in the football operation should report to him.\n\nThere are skeptics of the organization’s direction, and it’s easy to see why, given the lack of a decisive leader with years of NFL experience in charge of the entire football operation. Maybe Murphy is the smart one, but the way things transpired after Thompson’s demotion suggest not all the pieces are going to fit together the way he believes.\n\nSpeaking with current and former members of the organization, agents and friends for some of those employees and people who do business with the Packers, nearly 20 in total, there are concerns that the organization is headed down a faulty path.\n\nAll the sources quoted in this story have firsthand knowledge of what they described but asked not to be identified to protect their jobs and professional relationships. In the NFL, those who speak out without authorization from the club can find themselves out of work quickly and those with associations with the club who speak out of turn can find themselves cut off just as fast.\n\nRuss Ball a 'good man,' but polarizing figure\n\nMany of those interviewed expressed concern over Ball’s role and whether it was a mistake not to give Gutekunst full authority. Gutekunst served under both Wolf and Thompson, is well-liked, exudes an air of great confidence and would have been a general manager somewhere else if not in Green Bay.\n\nBall worked hard to learn the personnel side of the game and even spent time in team meetings to get a feel for that part of the operation. He has managed the salary cap beautifully, has a good reputation among the many agents with whom he negotiates and has the experience of working for four different organizations. Thompson has told friends that Ball “is a good man.”\n\nBut despite his anonymity outside the building, he is described as a polarizing figure by current and former associates. Agents who negotiate contracts with Ball call him fair and honorable. Others who have left the team say he is an organizational climber, rubs people the wrong way and has a personal agenda that interferes with the cohesiveness between the different departments.\n\nAsked about that, Murphy said any questions about Ball’s responsibilities or performance are born of jealousies that exist over how the front office shook out. He said Ball was an important part of the team’s success and was trusted by Thompson.\n\nMurphy acknowledged that Ball has a tremendous amount of responsibility, much of which he had before. But he acknowledged that before the change, Ball had to clear every decision he made with Thompson before moving forward.\n\nNow, nearly every football decision except team personnel goes through Ball’s office, and multiple sources said he has Murphy’s ear more than anyone else, creating an uneven dynamic in what was supposed to be an equal split of authority. Gutekunst has full say over the 53-man roster, but unlike Thompson and Wolf before him, he doesn’t control the message inside and outside the building.\n\nBall never speaks to the media or is out front when news is announced.\n\nUnder the current structure, the club doesn’t have a strong public presence like when McCarthy, Wolf or Mike Holmgren were leading the way. LaFleur didn’t come in and say he was going to win a world championship like McCarthy did or bring a pair of Super Bowl rings with him like Holmgren did. From all indications, he doesn’t have a forceful personality.\n\nHe’s also just 39 years old and will need to grow quickly into the position.\n\nGutekunst does not have authority over LaFleur or Ball except with roster decisions, and LaFleur has little of the influence McCarthy had when it came time to fight for something he wanted. So far, LaFleur has been allowed to make changes around the facility and add some former colleagues to his staff, but at least one friend worried that Murphy and Ball would lord over him.\n\nMurphy insisted LaFleur has autonomy with his coaching staff, is being given everything he needs to succeed and won’t be interfered with. Murphy is his boss and only Murphy has the authority to give him everything he wants.\n\nThe transition from Ted Thompson\n\nSo, how did it get to this point?\n\nBall originally looked like the odd man out after Murphy removed Thompson. But that changed with McCarthy’s firing Dec. 2. McCarthy opposed Ball’s candidacy to fill Thompson’s position in early 2018 and let Murphy know it, according to a source. He wanted someone steeped in personnel to acquire talent for him.\n\nBut it is McCarthy who is gone now and Ball who oversees finance, salary-cap management, player contracts, football administration, travel expenses, facilities, remodeling and the medical staff. These were all areas in which Thompson had final say and he rarely allowed emotion or personal relationships to get in the way of making the best decision for the franchise, various people within the franchise have said over the years.\n\nLike Wolf before him, Thompson set the direction of the football operation and together with McCarthy made sure the unique culture of a small-town NFL franchise remained. Both embraced the past success of the organization and made sure every player who walked through the door received a history lesson on the Packers.\n\nUltimately, Murphy removed the then 64-year-old Thompson because he was no longer able to carry out his enormous responsibilities the way he once had. During 2017 draft news conferences, he appeared worn down and rumors began circulating about his health.\n\nFew people knew anything specific about the illness that struck Thompson, but for someone who had spent endless hours traveling the country to scout players while also tending to daily matters, the job was becoming too big. Wolf, Thompson’s mentor, had retired at age 62 in good health because he no longer felt he could devote the necessary time to the job.\n\nThompson built one of the franchise’s four Super Bowl teams and gave everything he had to the organization, but he started to show signs of the autonomic disorder as early as 2014, about the time he underwent hip replacement surgery, according to one source. Murphy was made aware of some of the changes Thompson was going through, the source said.\n\nOut of respect for a man they loved and appreciated, McCarthy, Ball, Gutekunst, personnel men Eliot Wolf and Alonzo Highsmith and many others did everything they could to fill in where Thompson could not in the years to follow.\n\nIt wasn’t that Thompson couldn’t make well-reasoned decisions; it was that he wasn’t always available to make them because his work capacity had been reduced. Everything still ran through him, and while it was his style to let things play out rather than react too quickly, his inability to devote the same number of hours to the job slowed the operation.\n\n“Maybe keeping him going was the worst thing we could have done for him,” said one longtime front-office colleague.\n\nA close friend of Thompson's agreed that the good intentions of his colleagues may have backfired, adding that Thompson’s health should have been the priority, not keeping him in an intensely demanding position that might have been making things worse.\n\nIt is understandable why Murphy did not remove Thompson from the general manager’s chair earlier than he did. As much as his tightfisted salary management and aversion to free agency frustrated many inside and out of the organization, Thompson devoted his life to the job and demoting him would have been a difficult decision for Murphy.\n\nOn the other hand, Harlan had faced a similar situation in 2007 when his hand-picked successor, John Jones, was unable to manage the job due to a health problem. Harlan consulted with doctors and finally told Jones he had to step down.\n\nMurphy could have done the same much earlier with Thompson. He has run the Packers like a corporation and that puts him smack dab in the CEO seat, where the toughest of decisions are supposed to be made. If he wasn't aware of Thompson’s decline, he should've been, so the onus was on him to make a move, as tough as it might have been.\n\nMurphy pivots to three 'silos'\n\nIn a Jan. 2, 2018, news conference announcing Thompson’s removal, Murphy said he did not intend to change the front-office structure or get rid of McCarthy. He fully intended to replace Thompson with a general manager who oversaw the head coach. The way sources described it, Ball was going to be it.\n\nBall had spent years serving Thompson, doing some of the toughest work in the building. He did all of it with almost zero recognition from the public.\n\nWhen McCarthy heard Ball was going to be Murphy’s pick, a source said, he objected because he wanted an experienced personnel evaluator who would not be averse to signing free agents. He had accepted Thompson’s draft-and-develop philosophy — knowing each year he would be replacing veterans with rookies — because he was loyal to Thompson. But recent weak drafts had made it more necessary to sign free agents.\n\nMcCarthy couldn’t really leave — he had his contract extended through 2019 earlier in the year — but Murphy apparently felt he couldn’t tell McCarthy to accept Ball or go sit out the next two years at home. So, he went through his GM interviews with the head coach in the room. It meant Ball had to conduct his interview with the guy who didn’t want him in the job.\n\nUltimately, Murphy decided he would hire a personnel man as his general manager. He chose Gutekunst over Eliot Wolf (Ron's son) and Doug Whaley.\n\nGutekunst, a source said, thought he had interviewed for the same job Thompson had. But when Murphy reached him on his way to a general manager’s job interview in Houston, he offered a different job. Gutekunst would have final say on the 53-man roster, the draft and free agency, but he would not have the power to hire or fire the coach or oversee all facets of the football operation.\n\nGutekunst was taken aback but took some time and eventually decided he wanted to stay in Green Bay. Part of the reason might have been that he had a good working relationship with McCarthy and felt they could partner the way McCarthy and Thompson had.\n\nMcCarthy was not aware Murphy had decided to create a new structure until after the fact and was not pleased because of the influence it gave Ball, a source said. It turned out to be the beginning of the end for McCarthy. Once it looked like his team wouldn’t make the playoffs after a home loss to Arizona on Dec. 2, Murphy didn’t even wait until the stadium lights were off to fire him.\n\nWhen reached for this story, McCarthy said he was focused on the present and preferred not to dwell on the past.\n\nAfter Gutekunst took the job, Murphy rewarded Ball with the director of football operations title and a big raise, according to a source who learned about it directly from Murphy. The title was taken from Thompson’s job description, meaning Ball was being given control of everything but personnel.\n\nThe title change made it seem that Murphy was stripping Eliot Wolf of his title, but Murphy pointed out Wolf had been director-football operations, which was a separate title and one Thompson had created for Wolf. So, with Ball taking over the more important title, Wolf took off for a job with the Cleveland Browns.\n\nHe has declined to discuss his decision to leave, but it has caused a rift between Murphy and Ron Wolf, a source said. The elder Wolf moved to Cleveland and does not take part in any Packers-sponsored events, although he did attend Thompson’s Hall of Fame induction ceremony inside the Lambeau Field Atrium.\n\nWith Gutekunst in charge of personnel, Ball in charge of football operations and McCarthy the head coach, the three “silos,” as Murphy likes to call them, were established. Gutekunst wasn’t the general manager he expected to be, Ball wasn’t the general manager at all and McCarthy was in no man’s land with two years left on his deal.\n\nA source said when Ball was congratulated about his promotion, he scoffed and said it was not the job he wanted. He and McCarthy kept a working relationship, but they were both reporting to Murphy, and Ball worked more closely with the president than McCarthy did.\n\nA bumpy start for LaFleur\n\nAfter McCarthy was fired and the season ended, Murphy led a search committee for a new head coach. Gutekunst and Ball were his two primary advisers and all three were impressed with LaFleur’s interview in Nashville, Tennessee, on Sunday, Jan. 7.\n\nThey flew back to Green Bay and met the next day to discuss the prospects. According to two sources familiar with what transpired in the meeting, it was expected the candidates would be discussed some more and LaFleur would be brought in for a second interview. But Murphy was convinced the Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator was the guy and made the decision to hire him.\n\nAt the Jan. 9 news conference introducing LaFleur, Murphy insisted the entire search committee agreed that LaFleur was the choice and a decision was made to move quickly. Murphy did most of the talking at the news conference; Gutekunst was mostly in the background. Ball wasn’t part of it at all.\n\nA source said Gutekunst initially wasn’t going to be part of the news conference and that it would be just Murphy and LaFleur. But eventually, it was decided Gutekunst would take part.\n\nOnce he was up and running as head coach, LaFleur had to build a coaching staff. He was supposed to have complete control over the hiring of his staff. Defensive coordinator Mike Pettine was not forced on LaFleur, but the new coach was strongly encouraged to keep him.\n\nWhen it came to other assistant coaches, LaFleur wasn’t the sole decision-maker, sources said.\n\nLaFleur was excited about hiring highly regarded Miami special teams coach Darren Rizzi, who was not returning to the Dolphins and had told the Packers he would come up for an interview but was not going to sign for less than three years and total of $4.5 million, a source said.\n\nRizzi was told to come. He and LaFleur hit it off in their interview, the source said. But when it came time to talk about a contract, the Packers offered Rizzi less than he was seeking and Rizzi felt he had been led astray.\n\nHe left town. The Packers eventually met his price a couple of days later, but by that time Rizzi had decided to pursue other opportunities. LaFleur tried to convince him to change his mind but had no success.\n\nMurphy claims the Packers did not low-ball Rizzi and met his price before he left.\n\nRizzi ended up signing a three-year, $4.5 million deal with the New Orleans Saints.\n\nThompson had faced a similar situation when hiring defensive coordinator Dom Capers, a source said. Capers had a set price and wasn’t going to accept less. Thompson thought it was too much, but McCarthy and others convinced him they needed to do it and he gave in.\n\nCapers built a championship defense over the next two years and helped the Packers win Super Bowl XLV.\n\nA source said LaFleur was also interested in hiring assistant special teams coach Maurice Drayton to replace Ron Zook but didn’t think management would allow it because Drayton had been part of the disastrous 2018 special teams under Zook. Team officials vehemently denied this and said LaFleur could hire whomever he wanted.\n\nAfter striking out on another candidate, LaFleur hired Vanderbilt’s Shawn Mennenga and retained Drayton as his assistant.\n\nLaFleur interviewed offensive line coach James Campen for two days, a source said, and for a while it appeared he was going to stick with tight ends coach Brian Angelichio and defensive passing game coordinator Joe Whitt. But none of them were retained, and Whitt was fired without any notice.\n\nAs it turned out, nobody who had a long-term connection with McCarthy was retained.\n\nTwo sources with connections to the coaches said that was done on purpose and that Ball had a role in it, but Murphy and others vehemently deny it.\n\n“Matt was allowed to make his own decisions,” Murphy said.\n\nLaFleur wound up filling his offensive staff with several young position coaches with limited NFL experience, such as Adam Stenavich (offensive line), Jacob Outten (tight ends) and Alvis Whitted (receivers). He also hired former Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett and former Packers wide receivers coach Luke Getsy (quarterbacks) and retained running backs coach Ben Sirmans.\n\nNow that all the hirings and firings are done, LaFleur has started the process of winning over the players and developing a new culture. He still has a lot of work to do in forging a relationship with quarterback Aaron Rodgers and installing a new offensive system.\n\nIn the meantime, the organization enters its second year under its new front-office structure. Sources said the executive committee seems to be made up of people who are just happy to be connected to the Packers and have stayed out of Murphy’s business. At board of director’s meetings, it’s rare to hear someone question the Packers operation or Murphy.\n\nThe three-headed management team has high expectations for the 2019 season. Murphy and Ball OK’d $56 million in signing bonuses to free agents Preston Smith, Za’Darius Smith, Adrian Amos and Billy Turner, and they’ll be expecting a big return.\n\nThings need to turn around fast. Murphy has put himself at the top of football operations, and Ball is right there with him. Gutekunst will be judged on the talent he brings in.\n\nA lot is riding on LaFleur’s ability to succeed on the field this year with the team, and leadership structure, he's got.\n\nIt all starts when training camp opens July 25.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

The coach of the next team the Browns face, Dennis Allen of the New Orleans Saints, was fired Monday with the same record.\n\nThe bye week can give a lot of people time to ponder what has already happened. It can also give a lot of people, important people, time to ponder what changes they can make to try to shake things up.\n\nThat's how Allen ended up getting fired, even though the Saints don't have a bye this week. The Browns, however, do — and that can ramp up the stress levels around team headquarters.\n\n\"Two and seven's stressful for everybody,\" Stefanski said on a Zoom call Monday. \"Everybody's frustrated. I know I'm frustrated. Our players are frustrated. I'm sure our fans are frustrated right there with us when you have the record we have. We're focused on getting better. We're focused on using this week to find a way to get better and then go on the road and get a win next week. That's really where our focus is.\"\n\nStefanski and general manager Andrew Berry each signed extensions in June after the Browns went 11-6 and reached the AFC wild card round of the playoffs. They're already the longest-tenured coach and general manager in the expansion era, and longest-tenured combo for any era of Browns history since Peter Hadhazy was the general manager and Sam Rutigliano was the coach from 1978-84.\n\nExpert NFL Playoffs picks: Exclusive betting insights only at USA TODAY.\n\nBerry will speak for the first time since training camp on Wednesday morning. That will come after some potential changes to the Browns roster by the 4 p.m. Tuesday trade deadline.\n\nDefensive end Za'Darius Smith has been rumored to be candidate No. 1 among the Browns to be dealt. Other veterans, including defensive tackles Dalvin Tomlinson and Shelby Harris, also could be sent to a contender if the price is right.\n\n\"Honestly, we're just focused on just really who's here, who's present, knowing that we have no control over any of those things,\" safety Rodney McLeod said Monday. \"So what we focus on as players is, again, how can we do our jobs better in order to get a win on Sunday? And that's what we're here to do. We're here to win games, and we leave the rest to whosever role that is, to be quite honest.\"\n\nThe coaching staff — the offensive staff specifically — underwent a major overhaul during the offseason, with nearly every offensive coach new this season.\n\nStefanski indicated such changes weren't going to happen during the bye week.\n\n\"No, but we'll look at everything in terms of what we can do better,\" he said. \"No major changes expected.\"\n\nThe biggest changes have already happened for the Browns. One of those involving the coaching staff happened two weeks ago, when Stefanski ceded play-calling duties to offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey, who was part of a massive staff shakeup after last season.\n\nQuarterback Deshaun Watson's season-ending Achilles injury led to Jameis Winston taking over that starting role. Two games have provided two vastly different results in a win over the Baltimore Ravens a week ago and a loss Sunday to the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\"My focus is on us playing better as a team,\" Stefanski said. \"Obviously there were moments yesterday that we fell short. Jameis can play better. He knows that. We turned the ball over [and it] is just not a way to win in this league. He knows that. But that's really where we're just focused on getting better.\"\n\nInjury also opened the door for the Browns to make another change, with Dawand Jones taking over at left tackle. Jones first stepped into the spot against the Ravens when Jedrick Wills Jr. missed the game because of a knee injury.\n\nJones, though, remained in the spot against the Chargers despite Wills, a former first-round pick, being able to play. Stefanski seemed to indicate after the game the plan is for Jones to maintain that role, but removed all doubt about that Monday.\n\n\"Yeah, I do plan on keeping him there,\" Stefanski said. \"He's a young player that's going to continue to get better. It's not perfect. There's things he can get better at, but I do believe that leaving him there and letting him develop there is the best thing.\"\n\nThe change means Wills will be the swing tackle, backing up both Jones on the left side and Jack Conklin on the right. It's most definitely a fall from grace for the former No. 10 overall pick in the 2020 draft, who's battled knee injuries the last two seasons after having had his fifth-year option picked up in May 2023.\n\nStefanski acknowledged there was a change in roles for Wills. However, he wouldn't use the word benching to describe the moved away from him.\n\n\"It's all part of football,\" Stefanski said. \"You get injured sometimes and sometimes you go in as a backup. Sometimes you're a starter. That's just how this game goes. He's somebody that has played a lot of football for us. We've played and won with him. We have confidence in him, but in this case he's the swing tackle. He has to be ready to go in at a moment's notice, and he will be.\"\n\nChris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com.

He chose Florida A&M – he was one of the last signees of former head coach Earl Holmes – and was determined to make an impact for the Rattlers.\n\nWhen Norwood attended his first camp as a freshman, he made sure everyone would know his name by the end of the day.\n\nThe 6-foot, 190-pound junior has emerged as a leader on the Rattlers’ offense, said coach Alex Wood, who joined the Rattlers in December of 2014, after Norwood’s freshman year.\n\n“(Norwood has) grown and matured and is a more consistent player,” Wood said. “I know he likes to play the game, he enjoys the game and I am sure he respects the game – you have to.”\n\nWood added that while Norwood continues to grow in the system, he can sometimes get off track. Lately, his aspiration to be a trailblazer has been more apparent as the team is now three games into the season.\n\nLast season he had a team best 49 catches for 442 yards and two touchdowns, giving him a career total of 89 catches for 958 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nSaturday, against Tuskegee, Norwood had a breakout game. He caught seven passes for 65 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n“I’ve seen him grow every year,” Wood said. “I’m seeing more and more consistency the older that he gets and the more success that he has – I see his desire to want to be a leader. That’s a tough role and he’s working at it to get himself to where he can do it every day on a consistent basis.”\n\nNorwood, a man of few words, does not use the standard vocal leadership approach. He’s more action-oriented.\n\n“I’m not much of a talker, I like to lead by example,” he said.\n\n“I try to do extra before practice, during practice and after practice. I plan on showing the younger receivers to come out here and be great every day in practice, be a coachable player, listen to the coaches and work hard on every play.”\n\nDuring Norwood’s freshman year, he dealt with a major shakeup for the team. Holmes and his entire staff were fired midway through the season, and Norwood had to prove himself again to a new staff.\n\nAdjusting to Wood’s leadership was tough at first, Norwood said.\n\n“When coach (Wood) came it was kind of hard,” Norwood said. “It’s a whole new playbook, a new coaching staff and a new coaching vibe. Coach Holmes and Wood are two different coaches with two different coaching styles, but after coach (Wood) and I started talking more, we ended up getting better.”\n\nLuckily, wide receivers coach D.J. McCarthy served as an assistant head coach at rival school Bethune-Cookman, before coming to Florida A&M. He got a chance to see Norwood when the Wildcats and the Rattlers met in the Florida Classic.\n\n“I like some of the things that he did and how he attacked the defense and attacked the ball,” McCarthy said. “I thought he was a talented guy and when I got here, I looked forward to working with him.”\n\nMcCarthy has worked with NFL receivers like Brandon Marshall of the New York Jets, Anquan Boldin of the Detroit Lions and the recently-retired Nate Burleson. He said Norwood has the potential to be on the same level as those players – if he continues to work at it.\n\n“He has the physical skills and physical stature to be that quality type of receiver,” McCarthy said. “He’s learning how to work to be great and that’s what we are trying to emphasize. Our goal is for him to be the best player that he can be for this team.”\n\nNorwood said he wants to win the MEAC. Conference play gets started on Saturday against South Carolina State, but with eight games left and an 0-3 start, the Rattlers have their work cut out for them.\n\nNorwood’s goal is to help the team win in “any way he can, however it has to be done.”\n\nFlorida A&M vs. S.C. State\n\nWhen/where: Saturday, 6 p.m., Bragg Memorial Stadium\n\nRadio: 96.1 FM", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/01/06/nfl-coach-firing-black-monday-rumors-live-updates-news-analysis/77480241007/", "title": "NFL coach firing updates: Latest rumors, news on Black Monday", "text": "Updated Jan. 6, 2025, 6:00 p.m. ET\n\nNFL teams once again didn't wait until \"Black Monday\" to take drastic action with their coaching staffs this season.\n\nWith Week 18 wrapping up Sunday and the playoff picture complete, four teams already find themselves with vacancies in their top jobs: the New York Jets, New Orleans Saints, Chicago Bears and New England Patriots. History suggests more firings are still to come, with dismissals of key assistant coaches also likely in several spots. And it shouldn't take long for teams to begin moving on their searches, with interview requests sure to start filtering in.\n\nHere are all the latest updates on coach firings and moves throughout the league on Monday:\n\nBears request Cowboys' permission to interview Mike McCarthy for coaching vacancy\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys have yet to formalize their plans for 2025, but the Chicago Bears are lurking in the background as a potential option for Mike McCarthy depending on how things pan out.\n\nExpert NFL Playoffs picks: Exclusive betting insights only at USA TODAY.\n\nThe Bears on Monday requested permission from the Cowboys to interview McCarthy for their head coaching vacancy, according to multiple reports.\n\nMcCarthy is still under contract through Jan. 14, so the Cowboys would have to grant permission for him to speak with another team.\n\nOn Sunday, McCarthy said his preference was to remain in Dallas.\n\n“Absolutely. I have a lot invested here, and the Cowboys have a lot invested in me,” McCarthy said. “And then there’s a personal side to all these decisions. They all point the right direction. I think anytime you invest your time, energy, your belief, the connection you have, the relationships that are in place here, the understanding of what the organization can do and is willing to do. Those are all positive attributes that you take into account.\"\n\nThe Bears also requested to speak with Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, New York Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores and Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, according to multiple reports.\n\nShad Khan addresses decision to keep Jaguars GM Trent Baalke\n\nDoug Pederson's dismissal by the Jaguars came as little surprise on Monday. But owner Shad Khan's decision to keep general manager Trent Baalke stirred some intrigue.\n\nIn a news conference Monday, Khan pushed back against the notion that the Jaguars needed a \"complete overhaul,\" saying full-scale changes would be \"like shooting yourself in the foot.\" He also maintained that Baalke's presence wouldn't be an impediment to attracting a top coaching candidate.\n\n“We have a very compelling case of what we can offer the head coach,\" Khan said.\n\nKhan added that he's hoping the next coach will shake things up, calling Jacksonville \"the most predictable team\" on both offense and defense.\n\nAntonio Pierce is confident he's staying with Raiders\n\nAmid the various action through Monday, the Las Vegas Raiders had yet to indicate one way or another how they plan to proceed for 2025.\n\nBut when Antonio Pierce met the media on Monday, he stated his confidence he would be back for another season.\n\n\"I haven't been told anything different,\" Pierce said in a news conference when asked if he expects to return.\n\nPierce added speculation about his standing was \"coming from outside the building.\" He added he doesn't envision making any changes to his staff, which would indicate that interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner will remain in the role after taking over for the fired Luke Getsy.\n\nSeahawks fire offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb\n\nAfter one season, the Seattle Seahawks have moved on from offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb.\n\nHead coach Mike Macdonald, in charge of the defense, hired Grubb from nearby University of Washington to lead the offense after he helped lead the Huskies to the national title game last year. But the Seattle attack was inconsistent throughout the season, although quarterback Geno Smith continued his year-over-year statistical improvement. The Seahawks finished 28th in rushing yards as woes along the offensive line persisted.\n\nSmith stumped for Grubb following the team's win Sunday over the Los Angeles Rams, which put them at 10-7 on the season.\n\n\"Our first year, obviously there were some ups and downs ... I believe in this system,\" Smith said. \"I think Grubb has exactly what it takes to be a good coordinator in this league. It's his first year, man. Got to give the guy some grace.\"\n\nThe Seahawks, evidently, did not agree.\n\nSaints' interview list starts to come together\n\nThe New Orleans Saints haven't raced to begin the process of filling the void left by Dennis Allen's firing, but the team is starting to put together its plans for its head coaching search.\n\nThe Saints requested to interview Detroit Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady and Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, according to multiple reports. Glenn is a former protégé of Sean Payton who was an assistant coach in New Orleans from 2016-20 and has been widely linked to a possible return to the Saints.\n\nAll the players and the plays: Sign up for USA TODAY's Sports newsletter.\n\nAnother name emerges in Bears' coaching search\n\nThe Chicago Bears are moving forward with their coaching search by requesting an interview with Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzing, according to multiple reports.\n\nPetzing, 37, helped the Cardinals finish 11th in total offense this season, with the seventh-ranked ground game pacing the attack. He is in his second year as the Cardinals' offensive coordinator.\n\nThe Bears have already requested interviews with Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, according to multiple reports.\n\nPatriots make interview request after firing Mayo\n\nThe New England Patriots are moving quickly after firing Jerod Mayo on Sunday, as the team has requested an interview with Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, according to multiple reports.\n\nJohnson, who orchestrated the NFL's top-scoring offense and is expected to one of the most in-demand candidates this cycle, can conduct virtual interviews with teams starting Wednesday given the Lions have a first-round bye. Johnson withdrew from the last two coaching cycles and is expected to once again be discerning about the openings he pursues.\n\nThe Patriots have been widely linked to former Tennessee Titans coach and New England standout Mike Vrabel, but Johnson could also be a strong candidate given the need to support Drake Maye after the quarterback's promising rookie season.\n\nNY Jets make requests for open GM, HC roles\n\nJets owner Woody Johnson has to find both a new GM and head coach this offseason and wasted little time in making requests Monday for employees of postseason-bound teams.\n\nThe Jets have asked to speak with Kansas City Chiefs assistant GM Mike Borgonzi, according to ESPN. They also requested Los Angeles Rams senior personnel executive Ray Farmer. Farmer was the general manager of the Cleveland Browns from 2014-15. Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant general manager Mike Greenberg and Minnesota Vikings senior vice president of player personnel Ryan Grigson also received requests, per multiple reports. The team has already met with former Atlanta Falcons GM Thomas Dimitroff, ex-Tennessee Titans GM Jon Robinson, Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy and ESPN analyst Louis Riddick about the role.\n\nHouston Texans offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik received his first request for a head-coach opening from the Jets, per multiple reports, as did Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, San Francisco 49ers quarterbacks coach Brian Griese, Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores and Vikings quarterbacks coach Josh McCown. The team has met with former NFL head coaches Mike Vrabel and Ron Rivera regarding the opening.\n\nGiants owner won't put 'time limit' on Schoen, Daboll\n\nWith the Giants in desperate need of a quarterback, owner John Mara was asked about the timeline regarding the future of GM Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll if the team selects a rookie signal-caller in the draft and whether his commitment to them extended beyond next season.\n\n\"I understand the question, but I'm not going to put any kind of time limit on it,\" Mara replied.\n\nHowever, it does not appear the leash is long.\n\n\"It better not take too long, because I've just about run out of patience,\" Mara said.\n\nWhether Schoen and Daboll will enter the 2025 season on the hot seat, Mara replied: \"We're gonna have to see. I'm gonna have to be in a better mood this time next year than I am right now.\"\n\nMara said he spoke to Daboll on Friday and encouraged the head coach to surrender play-calling duties on offense and hinted at moving on from defensive coordinator Shane Bowen after one season.\n\n\"We stunk this year,\" Mara said. \"The results on the field were not what we wanted them to be. There were a number of factors that went into that.\"\n\nThe Giants are picking third in a class that draft analysts say has two first-round talents in Cam Ward and Sheduer Sanders. The two teams ahead of them, the Tennessee Titans and Cleveland Browns, are also seeking quarterbacks of the future, which once again puts the franchise in the awkward position of picking early in the first round but too late at the same time.\n\nFinding a quarterback is \"the number one issue\" entering the offseason, Mara said.\n\nCincinnati Bengals fire defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo\n\nA strong finish to the season could not save Bengals defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, as Cincinnati let him go Monday after a 9-8 season that ended with the team missing the playoffs for the second straight season, according to multiple reports.\n\nAnarumo's defense, which improved throughout the season, surrendered 34 points or more in six games – all during the team's 4-8 start. The late-season revival, even with a depleted secondary, wasn't enough to convince head coach Zac Taylor and Bengals management to keep Anarumo around.\n\nAnarumo was a finalist for the Arizona Cardinals head-coaching job during the 2023 offseason.\n\nWhich NFL teams could make coaching changes on Black Monday?\n\nWith the Jaguars (firing Doug Pederson) and Giants (keeping Brian Daboll), resolution came quickly for those teams Monday.\n\nBut a pair of other organizations are still expected to make their intentions clear: the Dallas Cowboys and the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nCowboys head coach Mike McCarthy worked this season on an expiring contract, though his deal runs through Jan. 14. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones has praised McCarthy in recent weeks and the coach said after Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders – which dropped Dallas to 7-10 on the season – said he is interested in remaining with Dallas.\n\nFor the Raiders, head coach Antonio Pierce earned the job based on the reviews he received from players after he took over as the interim head coach in 2023. But the Raiders finished 4-13 and will pick sixth in the NFL draft.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans are expected to retain first-year coach Brian Callahan, and the Miami Dolphins and Indianapolis Colts clarified Sunday that Mike McDaniel and Shane Steichen, respectively, would return for 2025. That leaves five openings as of Monday morning – the three teams that fired their coaches during the season are looking for new ones, as are the New England Patriots (who let Jerod Mayo go after one year) and the Jaguars.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars fire Doug Pederson after three seasons\n\nBlack Monday began in earnest with perhaps the most obvious move of the offseason: the Jacksonville Jaguars moving on from head coach Doug Pederson.\n\nBefore the season, owner Shad Khan claimed this was the most talented team in Jacksonville since he purchased the organization. But the Jaguars finished 4-13 and third in a dismal AFC South, and Pederson's time was up despite a pair of 9-8 campaigns in his first two seasons (leaving him with an overall record of 22-29).\n\nPederson led the team to a division title in 2022, his first season, and a dramatic comeback victory in the wild-card round over the Los Angeles Chargers before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Jags started the next year 8-3 but missed the postseason and Pederson, who led the Philadelphia Eagles to their first-ever Super Bowl, never regained his winning ways.\n\nIn a statement, Khan thanked Pederson and indicated general manager Trent Baalke will remain in that role.\n\nGiants' Brian Daboll, Joe Schoen safe after disaster season\n\nOnly one New York team will be on the hunt for a new coach and GM this offseason.\n\nGiants owner John Mara, in a statement Monday morning, said head coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen will return for the 2025 season.\n\n“As disappointing as the results of the season have been, (co-owner) Steve (Tisch) and I remain confident in the process that Joe and Brian have implemented and their vision for our team,\" Mara said in a statement. \"We look forward to the future and achieving the results we all desire.”\n\nThe Giants went 3-14 in 2024, their 100th season that was supposed to be a celebratory campaign. Instead, the brain trust hired three offseasons ago faced questions down the stretch of whether the would lose their jobs.\n\nThe \"Hard Knocks\" capturing the internal conversations between Schoen and Mara regarding former running back Saquon Barkley, who signed with the Philadelphia Eagles and had a historic season, served as fodder that the GM's job was in jeopardy. The product on the Giants' end kept declining. Quarterback Daniel Jones was benched and released midseason, and the team snapped a 10-game losing streak – the longest in franchise history – in Week 17.\n\nAccording to NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network, the Giants had a team meeting at 8 a.m. ET followed by team brass debriefs.\n\nDaboll was Coach of the Year following the 2022 season, which included a surprise playoff appearance and postseason victory. But the Giants went 6-11 last season and after one of the worst years in franchise history, Daboll made his case that better quarterback play – which he'd mostly been deprived of since 2022 – actually gives teams a chance of winning. Now it appears he and Schoen will have the chance to choose a franchise quarterback of the future.\n\nWhat's going on with Mike McCarthy and Cowboys? Coach, Jerry Jones address uncertain future\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' season ended the way it began: without Jerry Jones making a firm commitment to Mike McCarthy.\n\nFollowing Sunday's 23-19 loss to the Washington Commanders that wrapped up a 7-10 campaign for Dallas, the owner continued his long-running approach of speaking highly of his head coach while stopping short of saying anything definitive regarding McCarthy's job status for next season.\n\n\"Mike's one of the best coaches that I think there is,\" Jones said. \"He was made the coach here because I thought that, and he's done absolutely nothing to diminish my opinion of him as a coach.\"\n\nMcCarthy, who is under contract through Jan, 14, made it clear he wanted to remain with the organization despite speculation he could pursue another opening.\n\n“Absolutely. I have a lot invested here, and the Cowboys have a lot invested in me,” McCarthy said. “And then there’s a personal side to all these decisions. They all point the right direction. I think anytime you invest your time, energy, your belief, the connection you have, the relationships that are in place here, the understanding of what the organization can do and is willing to do. Those are all positive attributes that you take into account.\"\n\nLions' win could have ramifications for Ben Johnson, Aaron Glenn in coaching searches\n\nThe Detroit Lions' win over the Minnesota Vikings shaped the NFC playoff picture, but it also could have fallout for several teams' coaching searches.\n\nWith the Lions having a bye, offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn can now conduct virtual interviews for head-coaching roles starting Wednesday. Had Detroit lost, they would have had to wait an additional week.\n\nJohnson is seen widely as one of the most in-demand coaching candidates after withdrawing from consideration during the last two hiring cycles. Glenn has kept the Lions defense rolling despite a bevy of injuries, and he has been linked to both the Jets and the Saints openings given his history with each franchise as a former player and assistant coach, respectively.\n\nNext up for Patriots: Mike Vrabel?\n\nOn a day designed to be defined by on-field action, the Patriots turned heads with what they did after the completion of another trying year.\n\nRobert Kraft fired coach Jerod Mayo after only one season in what the Patriots owned called \"one of the hardest decisions I have ever made.\"\n\nWith Kraft making an abrupt pivot on the coach he appointed to be Bill Belichick's successor, USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell sees the Patriots positioning themselves for one candidate in particular: Mike Vrabel. The former Tennessee Titans coach - and Patriots Hall of Famer after his storied playing career - is arguably the most enticing candidate on the market, and he already interview with the Jets last Friday.\n\nWhile the Patriots will still be required to adhere to the Rooney Rule in their interview process, expect Vrabel's presence to hang over the search. And read Bell's column on why the connection is so hard to shake.\n\nAntonio Pierce mum on status with Raiders after loss\n\nAfter the Las Vegas Raiders fell to the Los Angeles Chargers in their season finale, Antonio Pierce had no interest in ruminating on where he stood with the organization.\n\n\"No comment,\" Pierce said when asked about his job security.\n\nThe Silver and Black continue to keep everyone in the dark regarding Pierce's future. There's been little insight as to the team's plans since owner Mark Davis said at the league meeting in early December that he was \"very disappointed\" with this season's results.\n\nDespite Las Vegas falling to 4-13, several players – including record-setting rookie tight end Brock Bowers – backed Pierce amid the ongoing uncertainty. Now it's up to Davis to make clear if he wants to bring back the coach he saw fit to make his full-time head coach after his successful interim stint or start from scratch.\n\nPederson holding out hope on Jaguars future\n\nDoug Pederson might have had the hottest seat of any coach entering Week 18, but the leader of the Jacksonville Jaguars is still optimistic he'll be given a reprieve.\n\n\"I’ll find out this week,\" Pederson said after a 26-23 overtime loss to the Indianapolis Colts dropped the Jaguars to 4-13 on the season. \"It's hard to speculate right now. Emotions are running. I hope I’m still here, honestly. I feel like we have the makings of being a good football team. Our main guys need to get healthy, we need to continue to work hard. I’m optimistic and hopeful that happens.\"\n\nOwner Shad Khan seemed to put the pressure on before the season by saying this season's iteration of the Jaguars was the best team to be assembled in franchise history. He gave Pederson a vote of confidence after a 1-4 start and did not make a move after Jacksonville suffered its greatest deficit ever in a defeat with a 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions.\n\nNo changes in Indianapolis as Irsay backs Shane Steichen, Chris Ballard\n\nBeing eliminated by a 45-33 loss to the New York Giants in Week 17 ramped up speculation that the Indianapolis Colts could shake things up by dismissing coach Shane Steichen and/or general manager Chris Ballard. After the season was completed Sunday, owner Jim Irsay moved quickly to confirm the duo would be sticking around another year.\n\n“I’ve been evaluating our entire operation, and I believe in Chris Ballard and Shane Steichen and our collective ability to make the improvements needed to take us to the next level in 2025,” Irsay wrote in a statement posted to social media. “I know fans who want an immediate change in leadership will be disappointed. That means we all have a lot to prove, so we’ll get back to work and keep doing what we can to earn your support and make you proud to be a Colts fan.”\n\nThe Colts have not been to the playoffs since the 2020 season and last won the AFC South title in the 2014 campaign. Since then, every other team in the division has claimed the crown at least twice.\n\nDolphins sticking with Mike McDaniel, Chris Grier\n\nDespite acknowledging that the Dolphins \"fell short of our expectations this season,\" owner Stephen Ross said he will keep coach Mike McDaniel and general manager Chris Grier in place.\n\n\"Their positive working relationship is an asset to the Dolphins, and I believe in the value of stability,\" Ross said in a statement Sunday. \"However, continuity in leadership is not to be confused with acceptance that status quo is good enough. We will take a hard look at where we have fallen sort and make the necessary changes to deliver our ultimate goal of building and sustaining a winning team that competes for championships.\"\n\nMiami finished 8-9 for the Dolphins' first losing season since 2019.\n\nOne of the first offseason tasks for McDaniel and Grier: get clarity on how to proceed with Tyreek Hill after the five-time All-Pro wide receiver indicated he would like to leave.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/03/30/ufl-coaching-changes-defenders-showboats/82711167007/", "title": "UFL coaches 2025: How league navigated two late coaching changes", "text": "March 30, 2025, 6:02 a.m. ET\n\nThe DC Defenders and Memphis Showboats are kicking off their seasons on Sunday. Both teams will do so without the coaches initially tapped to lead them during the 2025 UFL campaign.\n\nThe Defenders and Showboats saw Reggie Barlow and Ken Whisenhunt, respectively, step away from their roles within a week of the teams' season debuts.\n\nBarlow did so to take on the head coaching vacancy at FCS school Tennessee State, which was created in early March after Eddie George was hired by Bowling Green. Whisenhunt cited \"personal reasons\" for his departure.\n\nHow difficult was it for the UFL to deal with this type of coaching shake-up on the eve of the season? UFL president Russ Brandon conceded that the timing was \"not ideal,\" but noted the process of replacing the talented duo was relatively stress-free, as the league was able to promote from within.\n\n\"We have a real great stable of coaches in the UFL, but also (great) coaching staffs,\" Brandon told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview.\n\nExpert NFL Playoffs picks: Exclusive betting insights only at USA TODAY.\n\nCOULD UFL, NFL SHARE PLAYERS? Inside spring league's relationship with NFL\n\nHow UFL replaced Reggie Barlow, Ken Whisenhunt\n\nBrandon was quick to point out that Barlow and Whisenhunt's departures were \"far different\" from one another.\n\nThe league knows that Barlow's departure is \"permanent,\" and of the variety the UFL will experience given its status as a developmental league.\n\n\"We're thrilled for Reggie. It's a great opportunity for him and Tennessee State. And that's part of our business,\" Brandon said. \"It's what we do. (UFL executive vice president) Daryl (Johnston) and I were very, very prepared for that.\"\n\nBrandon and the UFL are leaving the door open for Whisenhunt to return. They didn't put a timetable on his potential return, but they want to allow the 63-year-old to come back and coach for the league should he be ready to do so.\n\n\"We'll see what the timeframe is on Ken,\" Brandon said. \"He could be back very quickly.\"\n\nWhile Barlow and Whisenhunt's absences may differ in term, the UFL took a comparable approach in addressing the vacancies.\n\n\"For us, it comes down to what is a seamless transition culturally,\" Brandon said. \"In both instances, we felt that both (Defenders interim coach) Shannon (Harris) and (Showboats interim coach) Jim (Turner) were the individuals to do that.\"\n\nWhy Shannon Harris, Jim Turner were named interim coaches\n\nHarris was the Defenders' quarterbacks coach under Barlow. That familiarity played a major role in the UFL's decision to elevate him into the interim head coaching role.\n\n\"He's worked with Reggie for years,\" Brandon said. \"He can stay consistent with the culture that they have built in DC.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Turner drew the nod for Memphis because he \"has a ton of NFL experience and coaching experience,\" which made him an ideal fill-in for Whisenhunt, who spent eight seasons in the NFL as a player and 23 as a coach.\n\nHarris and Turner were immediately thrust into their new roles and dove right into game-planning with the mission of keeping their teams on-task with their openers less than a week away.\n\nIt represented a challenge for the two first-time head coaches, but it was one Brandon believed was reflective of what the UFL represents.\n\n\"We're a league of opportunity,\" the UFL president said. \"That's one of our hallmarks.\"\n\nStill, Brandon made it clear that Harris and Turner weren't solely chosen because they were first-time head coaches.\n\n\"Whether you've been a head coach for 15 years or 15 days, it doesn't really matter to us,\" Brandon said. \"We're just looking for the right cultural fit, especially with the timing mechanisms.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/pro/browns/2024/01/22/andrew-berry-wont-comment-browns-coaching-shake-up-kevin-stefanski-deshaun-watson-myles-garrett/72314601007/", "title": "Andrew Berry won't comment yet on Browns coaching staff shake-up", "text": "Updated Jan. 22, 2024, 7:55 p.m. ET\n\nBEREA — Andrew Berry made his first public comments on Monday since the Browns' season came to an end in an AFC wild card loss to the Houston Texans.

He also served as Penn State's co-defensive coordinator the past two years with Bob Shoop.\n\nShoop left last weekend for the defensive coordinator job at Tennessee — just over a week after telling Pennsylvania media members how he hoped Penn State would have him forever.\n\nThat enabled Pry to be promoted from linebackers coach and to help ease Penn State through yet another big transition. He takes over the defense just as the Lions are breaking in a new offensive coordinator and offensive line coach. Herb Hand left the Lions Monday to coach the offensive line at Auburn.\n\n\"I'm fired up for him. My wife and I can't sleep,\" said Jim Pry, the offensive coordinator at Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida, and a most appropriate person to comment on this Penn State staff. Jim Pry coached Franklin at East Stroudsburg and has coached with new offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead and team consultant Jim Haslett.\n\nBrent Pry already has been a defensive coordinator at Louisiana-Lafayette (2002-06) and Georgia Southern (2010), where he was a finalist for the head coaching spot two of the last three years.\n\nPenn State chat, 8 p.m., Jan. 11\n\nMeanwhile, Pry and Franklin have known each other since their days at East Stroudsburg more than 20 years ago. Back then, Jim Pry was the offensive coordinator, Brent Pry was a young assistant and Franklin was the team's quarterback.\n\nIt's one thing for the Altoona native to lead the linebackers at Linebacker U. It's quite another to lead the entire defense.\n\n\"This is something he always looked at and wished for and didn't know he'd get the opportunity,\" Jim Pry said of his son.\n\n\"Brent's been around the horn and he knows the deal. ... People don't understand that it's all in perspective. Whether you're at Duquesne or TCU, people do the same things, they just have different players doing them. When you get down to Xs and Os, the conversation's really about the same things.\"\n\nPlus, Brent Pry \"wanted to be the 'caller' again,\" his father said. \"He enjoys preparing during the week to call the plays on Saturday. That was sort of missing. He's been waiting for this opportunity.\"\n\nPry has been Franklin's linebackers coach since he got the head job at Vanderbilt in 2011 and his assistant head coach since 2013.\n\nIn mid-December, Franklin said this of Pry: \"I don't think he gets enough credit ... in our defensive success over the last five years. I don’t want to lose him. I’ve got a lot of respect personally and professionally for Brent Pry. Not only is he valuable on our staff, he’s one of my best friends.”\n\nMeanwhile, Penn State also will be looking for a new offensive line coach.\n\nHand, one of the top-rated recruiters on staff, left for Auburn where he will be re-united with good friend and head coach Gus Malzahn.\n\nThey once shared the title as co-offensive coordinator at Tulsa, leading the nation's top-ranked attack two straight seasons. They are together again as Hand replaces J.B. Grimes, who left to become offensive line coach at Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n“My family and I are extremely excited to join the Auburn football family and be a part of a program with such great tradition and history,\" Hand said in a statement. \"We’re especially excited to rejoin Coach Malzahn and work with him again. It was an opportunity that was way too good for us to pass up. I want to thank Coach James Franklin and the Penn State football program for two great years and I wish them nothing but the best moving forward.\"\n\nLewis moving on\n\nThe Nittany Lions' most acrobatic receiver has decided to take his undergraduate degree and his final year of eligibility to the University of Oklahoma. Geno Lewis announced on Twitter Monday that he will transfer to Oklahoma to pursue his graduate degree and play his final season of college football. He hinted that he may not return to Penn State for his final season after catching a touchdown pass in the TaxSlayer Bowl loss to Georgia.\n\nAlways huge on potential, Lewis earned a reputation for leaping touchdown catches in big venues, including a stunning performance in the 2014 season-opener in Ireland (eight catches, 173 yards).\n\nAlthough he finished last season with 55 receptions, he was benched at mid-season and saw his playing time diminish this past fall. He was passed on the depth chart and finished with only 17 catches for 196 yards.\n\nHis 2015 highlights included spectacular scoring grabs against Maryland and Georgia and throwing a touchdown pass at Northwestern.\n\nHe issued a classy statement on social media, thanking everyone from Joe Paterno to Bill O'Brien to James Franklin, as well as his Penn State teammates, academic support staff and fans.\n\n\"This was not an easy decision but I feel it is time to move on to the next chapter of my life,\" he said. \"These last 4 years have been an incredible ride and I wouldn't change anything. ... Penn State will always be in my heart and no one can ever take that away.\"\n\nFormer standout Penn State receiver Justin Brown also transferred to Oklahoma, leaving Penn State in the middle of his career after the NCAA sanctions hit in the summer of 2012.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/11"}]}

Meanwhile, the American automaker's final quarterly earning report showed its annual sales fell for a second straight year. Tesla deliveries declined to 1.64 million, down from 1.79 million in 2024.\n\nIntensifying competition, the expiration of $7,500 federal tax credits for EV buyers and consumer backlash tied to Musk becoming the face of the Department of Government Efficiency made 2025 a challenging year for Tesla.\n\nStill, Tesla shares rose about 11.4% in 2025, boosting Musk's wealth. After Tesla published its final quarterly earnings report Jan. 2, its shares had dipped 1.2% by the afternoon, while BYD's shares had jumped about 5%.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nReach Rachel Barber at rbarber@usatoday.com and follow her on X @rachelbarber_\n\n(This story was updated to add a video.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/shopping/2025/12/10/consumer-reports-top-autos-report-card-2026/87706910007/", "title": "Consumer Reports reveals 2026 best car brands with affordable ...", "text": "Dec. 10, 2025 Updated Dec. 15, 2025, 3:18 p.m. ET\n\nForeign brands snagged 9 of top 10 spots on Consumer Reports magazine's 2026 Automotive Brand Report Card.\n\nJeep placed last.\n\nEarly adopters pay for innovation with reliability issues.\n\nThe average price of a new vehicle has soared past $50,000, but some outstanding vehicles are affordable and packed with features and technology that was cutting edge not long ago.\n\nThose are among the findings of Consumer Reports magazine’s influential 2026 Automotive Brand Report Card, senior director of automotive testing Jake Fisher told me in an interview.\n\nCR’s top 10 brands include affordable, mass market names like Subaru – No. 1 overall for the second straight year – No. 4 Honda, No. 5 Toyota and No. 8 Hyundai.\n\n“In some ways, less expensive vehicles are the most impressive,” Fisher said. “There are good values out there if you look for them.”\n\nConsumer Reports' 2026 top 10 auto brands\n\nSubaru BMW Porsche Honda Toyota Lexus Lincoln Hyundai Acura Tesla\n\nTesla’s best score ever\n\nTesla rounds out the top 10, the first time the EV specialist’s full brand has won such praise from CR, which had consistently criticized Tesla's reliability.\n\n“Tesla makes the most reliable electric vehicles now,” Fisher said.\n\nHe attributes that to the fact that most Tesla models have been in production for a long time.\n\n“Who’s been making EVs as long and as many as Tesla? Nobody,” he said. “The Tesla S hasn’t been redesigned in 15 years. Nobody else leaves a vehicle in production that long, but it’s been refined over time.” Despite, or perhaps because of, that, he pointed out that 5- to 10-year-old Teslas rank last in reliability for vehicles that age.\n\nConsumer Reports' top 10 luxury brands\n\nBMW Porsche Lexus Lincoln Acura Mini Genesis Audi Cadillac Volvo\n\nIn case you missed it: Best new cars in 2025?

GM’s Cadillac luxury brand came in at 17, one spot ahead of Ford itself. Buick, Chevrolet and Chrysler placed 20, 24 and 25, respectively.\n\nThree of the five bottom brands hailed from Stellantis, the global automaker that includes the traditional Chrysler brands.

When you add new features, you will have problems.”\n\nLincoln benefited from that. The brand’s two oldest models, the Aviator and Corsair, both saw their reliability increase. CR didn’t test Lincoln’s flagship Navigator because the luxurious big SUVs have exceeded the magazine’s price range. The Corsair is scheduled to go out of production shortly.\n\nCadillac’s fleet of EVs have been praised for their technology, performance and luxury, but “reliability has not been good,” Fisher said.\n\n“There’s always a learning curve, and GM’s always in the steep part of it,” because it moves from one technology to another, he said.\n\nHybrids rule, but not plug-in\n\nHybrids are now the most trouble-free powertrain, Fisher said, because the technology has been maturing for decades and the automaker most invested in it, Toyota, is a very cautious adopter of new ideas.\n\nWhile hybrids rule, plug-in hybrids or PHEVs, which feature bigger batteries and longer ranges on electricity alone, are less reliable, sharing issues including charging and cabin climate control with EVs.\n\n“Today’s hybrids are often quieter, smoother and more powerful than internal combustion engines,” Fisher said. \"Going forward that’s going to improve.”\n\nConsumer Reports compiles the annual report card based on road tests, owner reports, new and used car reliability, owner satisfaction and maintenance and repair costs.

LaReau\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nUpdated March 3, 2023, 7:37 a.m. ET\n\nGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra has teed it up to take on Tesla and some auto analysts are watching closely, viewing the next year or so as a \"renaissance\" period for GM's electric vehicle transition.\n\nEarlier this month, Barra told Wall Street that 2023 will be a breakout year for GM to prove it can roll out a series of new EVs and achieve industry-leading profit margins on them.\n\nBut what of the next five to 10 years? GM has its sights set on overtaking the current leader in U.S. EV sales, Tesla, which has a solid foothold in the United States and a wide-reaching and reliable charging network like no other. The latter gives it a competitive advantage over all EV makers, especially with consumers who have range anxiety.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts say GM is well-positioned for growth, in part because of a strategic supplier strategy that secures GM's ability to get the raw materials needed to make batteries. Also, GM has a good head start in building its own battery plants to secure battery production.\n\nBut a lot can go wrong for GM as it starts executing its plan to bring 30 new EVs to global markets by the end of 2025, which could keep Tesla on top, they said. Still, of the Detroit Three and other automakers, GM is in pole position to at least surpass Ford Motor Co. to become the second largest EV manufacturer in the United States by the end of the decade, possibly even topping Tesla by that time, some analysts said. In 2022, Tesla sold 522,388 EVs in the U.S., Ford sold 61,575 EVs and GM sold a little more than 39,000 EVs.\n\n\"GM is in a massive position of strength to accelerate its EV vision, and battery and lithium supply is locked into 2025 and beyond,\" Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told the Free Press. \"In our opinion, Barra and company are about to see a major renaissance of growth on its EV prospects for the Detroit stalwart. Tesla remains the clear EV leader, but GM will be a force in EVs for the next decade.\"\n\nThe Chevy Equinox EV will be the test\n\nIves believes that GM can be \"a clear No. 2 player in EVs by 2030.\"\n\n\"Tesla owns the EV market and was years ahead of Detroit with Musk’s strategic vision,\" Ives wrote in an email. \"In the EV landscape right now, it’s Tesla’s world and everyone else is paying rent.\"\n\nGM has said it expects global revenue from EV sales to be about $90 billion in 2030. It has not given a unit-sales target. GM said it plans to build 400,000 EVs in North America through the first half of 2024 and it is installing capacity to build more than 1 million EVs annually in North America and another 1 million in China in 2025.\n\nAs GM works toward its targets, Tesla reported it delivered a record 1.3 million vehicles globally in 2022, up 40% from 2021. GM spokesman David Caldwell said GM sold 542,332 EVs worldwide last year.\n\nOf Tesla's sales, 1.25 million were of the less pricey Model 3 and Model Y cars, according to a report by CNN. According to Tesla's website, the 2023 Model 3 starts at $42,990 and qualifies for a $7,500 federal tax credit for certain buyers.\n\nGM presently offers the Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV; both start at under $30,000. This summer, GM will bring the Chevy Blazer EV to market starting at $44,995 and the Equinox later in the year is expected to start at $30,000. Barra has said the Equinox EV's price tag will be key to mass EV adoption, and analysts will be watching to see whether she's right.\n\n\"The $30,000 Equinox (battery electric vehicle) coming soon is an interesting test to see if mass market consumers want EVs in high volume,\" David Whiston, auto analyst at Morningstar, told the Detroit Free Press in an email. \"I think it’ll succeed.\"\n\nWhiston stops short of saying GM will eventually take the EV sales lead from Tesla, though.\n\n\"Even if it’s true, it can always change,\" Whiston said. \"I like the moves GM has made as it’s making them more vertically integrated and I do think they are very well-positioned because they moved faster than basically every legacy automaker to transition to (battery electric vehicles).\"\n\nCan Tesla change the game?\n\nBut, Whiston warns, in time, Ford could close the battery production gap as it builds its own battery plants in Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. As to Tesla, Whiston is skeptical Tesla can hit its goal to manufacture 20 million EVs a year by 2030.\n\n\"I don’t cover Tesla anymore but our analyst who does has them annually selling 5.2 million vehicles by 2030, which would not make them larger than GM,\" Whiston said. \"That all comes down to do you believe something practical — that Tesla cannot reach its 20 million annual unit goal, as that’s two times Toyota’s size, or do you believe they can do something truly game changing and dominate the industry long term?\"\n\nThe winner of the EV sales race will also come down to who best delivers flawless execution of new EV production, because getting that right will help the manufacturer capture new sales and build customer loyalty, said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.\n\n\"GM has had some fits and starts like with the Chevrolet Bolt battery recall and slow start to the Cadillac Lyriq launch. Execution is critical,\" Krebs said, noting that GM came in behind Ford in EV sales last year and Hyundai and Kia are making significant inroads in EV sales.\n\nThe outlier analyst who puts GM at No. 1\n\nThere is at least one analyst who believes GM will capture the EV sales crown within five years. On Feb. 22, Seeking Alpha published an investment note called Green Growth Giants. Seeking Alpha is a crowdsourced platform for investment analysis, said Richard Lalich, managing editor of Seeking Alpha.\n\nThe note, which was written under the pseudonym Long Term Tips, said with EV raw materials expected to be in a \"prolonged period\" of short supply, GM's various partnerships with producers of materials needed for EV batteries such as cobalt, nickel and lithium, gives it a big edge.\n\nFor example, last month, GM said it will jointly invest with Lithium Americas Corp. to develop the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, the largest known source of lithium in the United States and the third largest in the world. Last fall, GM made a strategic investment in Queensland Pacific Metals of Australia to secure a supply of nickel and cobalt, both crucial to making batteries. Earlier last year, GM announced it made three supplier agreements to secure access to lithium, nickel, cobalt and Cathode Active Material (CAM) used in EV batteries. In December 2021, GM announced a joint venture with POSCO Chemical, which supplies CAM.\n\n\"While General Motors certainly isn’t immune from the potential of higher prices moving forward, it is the best-equipped automaker to navigate potential shortages,\" the research note said. That's because by securing production of critical materials, GM's supply chain should be protected against delays or extreme price volatility, the note said.\n\nBattery production offers control of production\n\nGM has also secured its battery production by partnering with LG Energy Solution in the Ultium Cells LLC joint venture. GM is spending about $7 billion to build three Ultium plants. The first, already operating, is in northeast Ohio. A plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, will open later this year and one being built in Lansing will open late next year. The move has put GM ahead of its Detroit rivals in terms of locking in production of the important EV batteries.\n\n\"Only GM controls their own destiny in the 313 area code,\" Ives said.\n\nIt is for that reason, along with GM's strong partnerships with suppliers, that GM \"will likely be able to overtake Tesla to become the best-selling EV brand in the United States within the next five years,\" the note on Seeking Alpha said.\n\nLalich declined to name the author of the Feb. 22 note, saying only, \"Long Term Tips has a Marketplace service on Seeking Alpha, which is a separate service for readers who subscribe to that author's articles. That service is called Green Growth Giants.\"\n\nTesla's biggest advantage is its charging network\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to EV adoption has been a lack of a reliable and fast-charging network across the United States. That's where Tesla has the advantage over everyone: Its proprietary Supercharger network is vast, fast and reliable. And, right now, only Tesla vehicles can use all of it.\n\nTesla has about 17,000 Supercharger stations in the U.S., according to a USA Today report. It has 40,000 worldwide, according to Tesla's website.\n\nRecently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk agreed to provide 7,500 open-access chargers in the U.S. to non-Tesla brands by the end of next year. The conversion of those existing chargers or construction of new ones to serve EVs made by Ford, GM, Hyundai, Kia, Volvo, Volkswagen and other electric automakers will be paid for by tax dollars as part of the Biden administration’s $7.5-billion plan to fund 500,000 EV chargers throughout the U.S. There are about 130,000 chargers in the U.S. now, but many drivers complain they are often not working or are slow to charge.\n\nOpening its charging network to outsiders will likely lead to bigger profit margins for Tesla.\n\nGM is working to compete. It launched the Ultium Charge 360 network in 2021 to help EV drivers find access to some 60,000 charging stations across the U.S. and Canada. GM is investing $750 million in the charging infrastructure through Ultium Charge 360 to encourage EV adoption.\n\n\"Clearly on a macro level, the EV charging infrastructure is critical to proliferation of EVs,\" Krebs said. \"That’s not just a GM challenge. That is every automaker’s challenge.\"\n\nContact Jamie L. LaReau: jlareau@freepress.com. Follow her on Twitter @jlareauan.

These electric vehicles ...", "text": "June 17, 2025 Updated June 23, 2025, 5:06 p.m. ET\n\nGeneral Motors electric vehicle sales show tremendous year-over-year growth.\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox (from GM's Chevy brand) is the company's best-selling EV in 2025.\n\nGM could rival Tesla in 2026 based on sales growth and attractive offerings.\n\nGeneral Motors is one of the Big Three American automakers alongside Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) and Ford. Like Ford, GM has made incredible headway in the EV space, rolling out competitive electric vehicles across its portfolio of brands. Some of its nameplates are giving the company the potential to overthrow Tesla as the dominant EV sales leader.\n\nAffordability, brand recognition, and Tesla's recent fall from grace are all contributing factors in GM's sudden EV sales boom. Does the automaker have what it takes to dethrone a brand that has become synonymous with electric vehicles in America?\n\nGeneral Motors EV sales up 183% year-over-year\n\nGMC electric vehicle sales increased by a whopping 183% from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025, according to Cox Automotive, an automotive research company. The American automaker sold 4,728 EVs, up from 1,668 EVs in the first quarter of 2024. Its Chevrolet brand sold 19,186 electric vehicles, a 114% increase from 8,957 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nCadillac, GM's luxury division, saw electric vehicle sales increase by over 37% from 5,800 to 7,972 year-over-year. On paper, General Motors is gaining serious traction in its mission to become a competitor in the EV space. A closer look at some of its most popular offerings across its portfolio of brands shows just how easy it could be for the company to overtake Tesla in the future.\n\nBestselling General Motors electric vehicles (across portfolio) for Q1 2025\n\n◾Chevrolet Equinox EV (10,329 units)\n\n◾Chevrolet Blazer EV (6,187 units)\n\n◾Cadillac Lyriq (4,300 units)\n\n◾GMC Hummer Truck/SUV (3,479 units)\n\nThe Chevrolet Equinox EV leads the charge for GM EVs\n\nGeneral Motors offers 10 electric vehicles across its GMC, Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands. Of the 10 EVs, the Chevrolet Equinox EV is its bestselling model by thousands of units. Chevrolet has sold 10,329 Equinox EV models in Q1 2025. Its pricing and specs explain why the electric family SUV is becoming so popular among drivers.\n\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV LT 1 front-wheel drive starts at $34,995. According to Chevy, it's eligible for the federal electric vehicle tax credit of $7,500, bringing its true cost closer to $27,495. The Equinox EV is the most affordable electric SUV in its segment (factoring in the tax incentive).\n\nChevy's EV has an estimated 319 miles of driving range. It also comes with plenty of advanced standard features despite its low starting price.\n\n2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV standard features\n\n◾A 17.7-inch diagonal advanced color LCD\n\n◾Adaptive cruise control\n\n◾Automatic emergency braking\n\n◾Natural voice recognition\n\n◾Rear park assist\n\nThe Equinox EV comes in three trims: the LT 1, LT 2 ($41,900), and RS ($43,400) final configuration. Chevy offers all-wheel drive on every trim for an additional cost. Each trim is more affordable than the average new vehicle cost (nearly $50K according to CNBC). The federal EV tax incentive makes these options even more attractive for drivers looking to save money on a new electric vehicle.\n\nWhy General Motors could beat Tesla in the long run\n\nGM's explosive year-over-year EV sales growth could be a sign of things to come as the company's electric vehicles gain popularity and market share. GM EVs may not beat Tesla EVs when it comes to a direct side-by-side comparison in the performance category, but the company has a competitive edge in terms of pricing.\n\nTesla's most affordable electric vehicle is the Model 3 sedan, which starts at $42,490 ($34,990 post-tax incentive). In comparison, GM's most affordable EV across its portfolio, the larger Equinox EV, is more affordable than Tesla's sedan by $7,495. While both models are below the average new vehicle price, the Equinox EV offers more value for American families in terms of cabin and cargo space as a larger model.\n\nAnother factor in the sales battle between GM's brands and Tesla is the damage that Tesla has sustained since January. The company's share price nosedived by over 41% from Jan. 2 to April 8. Additionally, Americans have protested Tesla and its CEO due to Elon Musk's former role as senior adviser to the president.\n\nTesla stock is down 15% from Jan. 2 at the time of writing, but the brand has suffered damage that's wreaking havoc on global sales. The recent sales plunge is the biggest decline in history, according to CNN. So, General Motors and its portfolio of brands could have a better shot at besting Tesla in electric vehicle sales in 2026.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/cars/recalls/2025/12/31/tesla-2025-recall-and-investigations/87962810007/", "title": "Tesla recalls in 2025 include Model 3, Cybertrucks: See complete list", "text": "Dec. 31, 2025, 11:00 a.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary Tesla issued 11 recalls in 2025, affecting more than 745,000 of its electric vehicles.\n\nRecalls addressed issues ranging from rearview camera failures and loss of power steering to faulty seat belts and detaching trim panels.\n\nFederal regulators also opened five new investigations into Tesla in 2025 for issues including its driver-assistance technology and emergency door handles.\n\nTesla had 11 recalls filed with the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2025, involving more than 745,000 of its electric cars.\n\nThe company also had five investigations opened by federal regulators, even as its CEO Elon Musk was serving as an advisor to President Donald Trump in the first half of the year and leading the charge on cuts to federal agencies like NHTSA.\n\nHere is a list of notable Tesla vehicle recalls by month in 2025:\n\nJan. 7: Recall for rearview camera failure\n\nPotential number of cars affected: 239,382\n\nDetails: Tesla recalled certain 2024-2025 Model 3, Model S, 2023-2025 Model X, and Model Y vehicles because the cars had computer circuit boards that may short, resulting in the loss of the rearview camera image, according to documents released online by NHTSA.

Heavy competition from Tesla and local rivals in China, which is rapidly adopting EVs, and stalling demand in Europe and the U.S. have intensified the pressure traditional automakers face.\n\nHonda and Nissan on Tuesday issued identical statements saying no merger had been announced by either company. Reuters has not independently verified the report.\n\n\"As announced in March of this year, Honda and Nissan are exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths,\" the companies said in separate statements, adding they will inform stakeholders of any updates at an appropriate time.\n\nNissan-Honda link would be biggest auto merger since Stellantis' creation\n\nIn addition, French automaker Renault, a major Nissan shareholder, said it had no information and declined to comment.\n\nOver the past year, an EV price war launched by Tesla and Chinese automaker BYD has intensified pressure on any companies losing money on the next-generation vehicles. That has put pressure on companies like Honda and Nissan to seek ways to cut costs and speed vehicle development, and mergers are a major step in that direction.\n\nHonda's market capitalization is 5.95 trillion yen ($38.8 billion), while Nissan's is 1.17 trillion yen ($7.6 billion). Any deal would be the biggest in the industry since the $52 billion merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA in 2021 to create Stellantis.\n\nHonda's U.S.-listed shares were up 1.3% in afternoon trading.\n\nHonda and Nissan, Japan's second- and third-biggest automakers, respectively, after Toyota, have been losing market share in China. That nation accounted for almost 70% of global EV sales in November, with more than 1.27 million in purchases for the month.\n\nThe two had combined global sales of 7.4 million vehicles in 2023, but are grappling with challenges from EV makers, particularly in China, where BYD and others have surged ahead.\n\nGlobal automakers General Motors and Ford have slowed investments in EVs as high borrowing costs and poor charging infrastructure hinder their adoption despite government incentives. In September, GM said it was in talks with South Korea's Hyundai Motor to explore ways to collaborate in a move to cut costs, including on joint vehicle development.\n\nEuropean and Trump turmoil\n\nEurope's car sector is in turmoil, with thousands of jobs on the line as automakers suffer from a weakening market, high costs, a slower-than-expected takeup of EVs and increasing competition from Chinese rivals.\n\nVolkswagen has threatened to close plants in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history, cut jobs and slash wages to reduce costs and boost profit. Last week, Europe's top carmaker said it will close its Audi plant in Brussels next year.\n\nIn Europe, Volkswagen is locked in acrimonious talks with its union over cost cuts as it struggles with falling demand and rising costs.\n\nThe global auto industry is also bracing for a potential rollback of EV-friendly policies by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Reuters has reported.\n\nAny merger would face significant U.S. scrutiny, and Trump has vowed to take a hard line on imported vehicles —including threatening 25% tariffs on vehicles shipped from Canada and Mexico — and he could seek concessions from Honda and Nissan to approve any deal, auto industry officials said. During his first term, Trump threatened tariffs on Japanese vehicles.\n\nHonda and Nissan in March agreed to cooperate in their EV businesses, and in August deepened their ties, agreeing to work together on batteries, e-axles and other technology.\n\nThe automakers are looking to operate under a single holding company and are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding soon for the new merged entity, the Nikkei reported.\n\nHonda and Nissan are also looking to bring in Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan is the top shareholder with a 24% stake, under the holding company, to create one of the world's largest auto groups, the report said.\n\nMitsubishi officials did not have an immediate comment.\n\nThe stakes of Honda and Nissan in the new entity, along with other details are to be decided later, Nikkei said.\n\nNissan has been reeling from weak demand in China and the U.S., prompting the Japanese automaker to take cost-saving measures such as corporate rejigs.\n\nLast month, the company said its half-year net earnings were down more than 90% from a year ago and cut its annual operating profit forecast by about 70%.\n\nNissan had been at the forefront of EVs in the 2010s with the Leaf model, but has been overtaken this decade by newcomers and pure players.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/04/09/trump-china-trade-war-global-ev-race/83015590007/", "title": "Make America gas again: How Trump's trade war with China ...", "text": "Updated April 9, 2025, 7:57 p.m. ET\n\nAmerica just experienced a tire blowout in the international race to create the best electric vehicle brands.\n\nChina is fierce competition in the EV space and a trade war could give them a lead that leaves the U.S in the dust.\n\nBrands like BYD and Xiaomi are already producing spectacular EVs that could become more popular due to tariff turmoil.\n\nThe race to create the world's most popular vehicles is underway, and the United States is on the verge of losing its confident lead. For the last few years Tesla has dominated competitors from Europe and Asia in individual vehicle sales despite America's slower approach to the mass adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, over 1.7 million EVs were sold in America in 2024. That's up from a mere 300,000 electric vehicle sales in 2020. It's no secret that EVs are becoming more popular in America, but what are the financial implications of a foreign automaker becoming the undisputed sales and product leader in the electric vehicle space?\n\nMillions of electric vehicles could be sold in America in the years to come. If those vehicles are from foreign nations, consumers could pay hefty prices due to import tariffs. Furthermore, the world automotive industry market size is projected to reach over $6 billion dollars by 2033, an increase from over 3.5 billion in 2023, according to Yahoo finance.\n\nThere are billions of dollars on the line in the race to create the most popular electric vehicles internationally. The victorious country will win millions of vehicle sales which translates to tax revenue, jobs and reinvestment in dominating brands.\n\nThe inspirations behind EV sounds: Revving engines, fighter jets and classical tunes\n\nThe American auto industry is a cornerstone of the economy. It has taken major hits through financial crises, playing a huge role in the Great Recession of 2008. The emerging EV space is a huge opportunity for American companies to experience international sales success. So, who are the big names in this race and why is America quickly losing steam?\n\nWhat is the best-selling electric vehicle in the world?\n\nThe U.S. may not produce the most EVs by volume, but America produced the best-selling electric vehicle in the world in 2024. To top it off, this EV is mostly American-made. The Tesla Model Y held the crown in 2024 and has been making waves in the industry since deliveries began in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nA whopping 69% of Tesla parts are made in the United States or Canada. The company's CEO Elon Musk may be eccentric, but Tesla produced a mind-blowingly popular product in a competitive market using mostly American parts. The Model Y and Model 3 gave America an edge as superior products in the market momentarily.\n\nWhich country is leading in electric vehicles?\n\nUnfortunately for the home team, China is dominating the EV space in terms of both production and sales. The country may not have produced the best-selling electric vehicle in the world last year, but they were certainly in the running. Furthermore, nameplates like the BYD Seal are gaining popularity. The BYD Seal electric sedan starts under $25,000 in China, which is more affordable than the Tesla Model 3 electric sedan.\n\nFrom affordability to impressive specs, it seems Chinese EVs are outperforming American electric vehicles in nearly every arena. The Xiaomi SU7 is a Chinese luxury sport sedan that has captured the attention of major automotive and technology influencers such as Doug DeMuro, Marques Brownlee and Forrest Jones.\n\nThe Xiaomi SU7 produces 673 horsepower, has 497 miles of range on a single charge, and rockets from 0-60 miles per hour in a mere 2.7 seconds. Drivers can recharge the SU7's battery from 10-80% in just 20 minutes. Simply put, there are no American EVs that impressive for under $60,000. The Xiaomi SU7 in the TikTok video below has a sticker price around $41,500. Houston, we have a problem.\n\nHow Trump's tariffs will affect the EV race\n\nDonald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariff policy has prompted swift retaliatory tariffs from China. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced 104% tariffs on China on April 8 during a briefing. Where does this leave consumers?\n\nEconomists and automotive executives predict that Trump's tariffs will make manufacturing significantly more expensive and difficult. The increased costs could lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nOn the sales side, retaliatory tariffs will increase the prices of American-made electric vehicles like the popular Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3 internationally. This will cause American EVs to be less attractive in the eyes of foreign consumers and more affordable nationally produced models to be more appealing. Who would have thought that Donald Trump would be the one to stop Tesla's amazing international sales run in its tracks?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/ford/2022/08/08/ford-electric-vehicles-tesla/10237141002/", "title": "Ford CEO: We're only company challenging Tesla electric vehicles", "text": "Aug. 8, 2022 Updated Aug. 9, 2022, 4:39 p.m. ET\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley opened his remarks during a call late last month with industry analysts by taking a subtle swipe at competitors in the electric vehicle high-stakes \"arms race,\" saying many automakers are talking about investing money and \"promises of future leadership\" — but few are executing.\n\n\"What's lost ... is one fundamental question: Who is, and will be, in the best position to design truly distinctive and appealing products that people actually love? That's the question,\" Farley said July 27 after disclosing second quarter earnings.\n\n\"We've been overwhelmed with the demand for our first generation EVs, the Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning, and the E-Transit,\" he said. \"These products are in the market now, and we have strong multiyear order banks. We're selling them as fast as we can make them, and you can't say that about many of the EVs coming to market now.\"\n\nFarley didn't specify which competitors he meant. But he is right about one thing: There is an EV arms race and it is intense.\n\nTiming is everything\n\nGeneral Motors has more than two dozen all-new electric products planned but has shipped few of its much-touted new Ultium-powered EVs to customers.\n\nTesla, the segment leader that has delayed and rescheduled its Cybertruck for years, still leads in EV sales.\n\nToyota, which became a green darling after launching its popular Prius hybrid in 1997, has recently been targeted by environmental groups for foot-dragging in its pivot to electric. \"Toyota Led on Clean Cars. Now Critics Say It Works to Delay Them,\" the New York Times said in a July 2021 headline. \"... As the world moves toward electric the company is fighting climate regulations in an apparent effort to buy time.\"\n\nWhile GM decided to take extra time designing a new lineup of electric vehicles from a clean sheet, Ford jumped into the market quickly by modifying vehicles people would recognize with the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit. The Mach-E was purpose built to be sexy and inspire buyers who wouldn't otherwise switch from gasoline-powered to battery-powered.\n\nGM is expected to flood the market with new EVs over the next 18-24 months.\n\nThese very different high-risk strategies illustrate how much money is at stake.\n\nGM began delivering the 2022 GMC Hummer EV pickup late last year but its starting price of $108,700 makes it a niche luxury vehicle. Through June, GM sold 371 Hummers.\n\nFord said it has delivered Lightnings to customers in all 50 states, including government purchases including Los Angeles, Charlotte, North Carolina, Portland, Oregon, Orange County, Florida, and the state of Colorado.\n\nFord sold 15,273 electric vehicles in the second quarter, more than double those sold by crosstown competitor GM.\n\nTesla doesn't reveal its U.S. sales.\n\nPublic response and years-long order banks will allow Ford to \"grab an outsized share of the rapidly growing EV market,\" Farley said. \"We have a clear path to reach a run rate of 600,000 EVs by the end of next year. And that will lead to a foundation to 2 million by late 2026.\"\n\nFarley said Ford does not view its competition simply as fellow legacy automakers but also electric vehicle companies, including emerging Chinese players.\n\nEarly sales data indicates Ford is a serious contender, he said.\n\n\"We've sold more than 3,000 E-Transits in the U.S.\" during the first six months of this year, Farley said. \"That's a market share of 95% in the full-size electric van market, 95%. In fact, our next two competitors combined sold just 159 vehicles.\"\n\nThe snapshot: Ford sold 3,008 E-Transits, Rivian sold 13 EDV700 vans and GM sold 146 of the BrightDrop Zevo 600 vans, according to the automakers. GM and Rivian just began production of their electric delivery vans, while E-Transit sales began in January.\n\nA strong start\n\nIndustry analysts say Ford is on the move and the company to watch, regardless of recent recalls and lawsuits that have affected new vehicles.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of promises and plans from a lot of automakers,\" Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Cox Automotive told the Free Press. \"It's important to look at who's delivering what today. It's reality, not just a promise or an intention.\"\n\nPlus, Ford exceeded industry expectations when it reported $3.7 billion in second quarter earnings, triple of that a year earlier.\n\nAdam Jonas, a veteran industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, said to Farley during the earnings call, \"This is one of the most positive Ford calls I can remember in a long time.\"\n\nTrolling the competition\n\nWhile talking smack isn't new among competing automakers, the EV race adds new players and, thanks to social media, industry analysts and customers hear directly from top executives.\n\nAfter luxury electric carmaker Lucid delivered just 679 vehicles during the second quarter, for example, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mocked the company on Twitter.\n\n\"I had more kids in Q2 than they made cars!\" he tweeted from his iPhone on Thursday.\n\nJoe McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, said the industry has noticed Ford going all in on electrification — and seeing success.\n\n'Not easy'\n\n\"I think Farley is being very good in his transparency, saying it’s a tough road, we'll do the best we can,\" McCabe said. \"There are too many new players that are offering this magical Tesla replacement and then finding automotive is a very difficult industry to compete in. Case in point: Rivian came out as the darling. They finally realized making a vehicle is not easy.\"\n\nWhile electric vehicle Rivian became the first automaker to deliver an all-electric pickup in September 2021 in hopes of challenging Ford, the startup has delivered far fewer vehicles than hoped and its stock has suffered.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra remains out front and aggressive, McCabe said. But Ford being first to mass market with electric trucks is powerful, he said. And it reminds investors that legacy automakers know how to build and deliver vehicles for the masses and quickly.\n\n\"Farley has done a really good job of saying ... 'Keep your eye on the legacy players. We know what we’re doing,' \" McCabe said. \"I think there's an underlying theme that, in the long run, 'We're going to win. If Cybertruck comes, we're Ford. We're going to win.' \"\n\nGM has to cringe at Farley's comments, McCabe said.\n\n\"They are still over a year away from building electrified Sierras and Silverados at volume,\" he said.\n\nFarley is clearly taking joy in beating GM to market with an electric pickup while emphasizing the lack of experience that cripples newer companies, McCabe said.\n\n\"Ford has a global footprint. It has weathered all the pain of the last 10 decades. When you've taken the beatings, you know how to survive,\" he said.\n\nDepending on another round of investment dollars is different than having internal combustion engines fund the electric vehicle side, which is what Ford revealed it was doing in March, McCabe said.\n\nBarra has repeatedly expressed her confidence in earnings calls that GM will be the EV leader in the future, setting a goal to build 1 million EVs in North America by 2025.\n\nWhether Farley's comments were directed at GM doesn’t matter, GM spokesman Jim Cain told the Free Press. “The real question is where will we all be in a year, two years, five years or 10 years. We wouldn’t trade our position with anyone.”\n\nGM is not without its own bragging points. The 2023 Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV (electric utility vehicle) start at $25,600 and $27,200 respectively while the base price of a 2022 Mach-E is $43,896.\n\nFarley is choosing not to acknowledge the fact that GM sold more than 20,000 Bolts annually before Ford delivered the first Mach-E. The Bolt won awards, but the Mach-E, with its looks and legendary Mustang badge, is iconic and sexy. Ford seems to have won the war of public opinion with its timely launches, to date.\n\nErik Gordon, a longtime observer of the auto industry and a business strategy expert who teaches at the University of Michigan, said no one should ignore the fact that the electric Silverado is coming and it will affect Lightning sales.\n\n\"With other companies, it is more speculative,\" he said. \"There are claims about future deliveries you should ignore, but there are also claims about future deliveries you can’t ignore.\" Like Ford, Chevrolet has proven it can build and sell hundreds of thousands of pickups year in and year out.\n\nTriple play\n\nFord touted its July sales data Aug. 2, continuing with its monthly release of numbers while some competitors -— notably GM — release quarterly.\n\nIn July, Ford reported sales were up 36.6% while the industry was down 10.5% in the U.S.\n\nFord held 10.9% share of the EV segment, highest on record for the company, compared with 7.3% in second quarter and 4.4% in first quarter.\n\nFord sold 7,669 electric vehicles in July, a 168.7% jump compared with a year ago.\n\nKeeping an eye on GM\n\nGM's electric vehicle sales exceeded 7,300 units in the second quarter, including the BrightDrop Zevo 600 electric van and the GMC Hummer pickup, as well as the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV, which resumed production after a long halt due to faulty batteries.\n\nGM also delivered its first 2023 Cadillac Lyriq electric luxury SUV last month.\n\nInvestors are closely watching electric vehicle sales and production. During the first half of the year, Tesla sold an estimated 273,618. Ford sold 22,979, Volkswagen sold 12,424 and GM sold 7,820, according to reported by the companies.\n\nIf Farley’s comments to analysts were directed at GM, this wouldn’t be the first time Farley has taken a swing at the automaker.\n\nIn 2011, when Farley was running Ford’s marketing, he was quoted in former New York Times reporter Bill Vlasic’s book “Once Upon A Car” as saying, “F*** GM. I hate them and their company and what they stand for. And I hate the way they're succeeding. Ford is back because people trust us. And that is a powerful message. I'm a car guy. I wake up each morning thinking about cars. Watch out. We're only going to get better.\"\n\nFarley later apologized.\n\nEarlier that same year, GM’s then-CEO Dan Akerson was quoted in The Detroit News as saying Ford \"might as well sprinkle holy water\" on Lincoln, implying the brand is dead.\n\nChasing Tesla\n\nErich Merkle, Ford U.S. sales analyst, said the company is pragmatic about what's ahead but tireless when it comes to seriously delivering vehicles.\n\n\"There are a lot of electric vehicle companies out there,\" he said. \"Seems like every day there’s a new one that pops up that nobody knows but is full of hope and potential. But our sales are real. It's tangible. ... We're in the No. 2 spot behind Tesla.\"\n\nMake no mistake, Tesla is definitely in the electric vehicle lead, Merkle said. \"But we're growing three times faster than the segment overall.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard:313-618-1034 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

Those sales were driven by sharp sales increases in both the Equinox and Blazer EVs.\n\nRory Harvey, GM executive vice president and president of global markets, said in a statement that GM's sales growth for the quarter ending March 31 outpaced other automakers due to its vehicle portfolio. Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC and Buick all reported double-digit growth in the quarter.\n\n“We're the industry leader in trucks and affordable small SUVs, Cadillac is growing significantly in luxury, and we have the broadest portfolio of EVs in the industry,” Harvey said.\n\nSales gains\n\nGM sold 61,822 Buicks in the quarter, up 39%. Total Chevrolet sales of 443,564 marked a nearly 14% increase, and GMC rose about 18% to 146,220 vehicles.\n\nCadillac sales rose about 18% to 41,757, including the first sales figures for the all-electric Optiq, at 1,716, and the Escalade IQ EV, with 1,956 sold in the quarter compared with 12,683 of its internal-combustion counterpart.\n\nNot every sales gain for GM reflected dramatic improvements. GM reported sales of just 274 Chevrolet BrightDrop vehicles in the quarter, up 7% from 256 sold in first quarter 2024.\n\nLow sales of the vans, which include BrightDrop 400 and 600 EV models as well as BrightDrop Zevo 400 and 600, reflect an ongoing struggle that GM has had in moving these Canadian-made electric vehicles. GM folded the commercial vans into its Chevrolet brand in a bid to increase sales to dealers, while a Free Press photographer captured images last month of hundreds of vehicles lining a Flint, Michigan, storage lot. Reuters published similar photos from the CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario.\n\nVehicle inventory\n\nGM said its inventory of vehicles, which is the number of vehicles currently on dealer lots or en route, fell 8% to 549,312 in the first quarter — even though there were two fewer sales days in first-quarter 2025 compared with 2024.\n\nThose levels fall within GM’s target expectations, the company said, though inventory availability will likely become a serious concern across the industry once tariffs go into effect. Sales of the Chevrolet Trax SUV, which is made in South Korea, shot up 57%.\n\nGM also said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose less than 3% in the quarter, to roughly $51,000. The Detroit automaker also said the company practiced “disciplined” incentive spending below 4%, less than the industry average of 7%.\n\nAnalyst reactions\n\nGM's sales surpassed some analyst predictions, even though those estimates still put GM ahead of the competition.\n\nSales predictions of 656,450 vehicles from Atlanta analytics firm Cox Automotive published ahead of GM's report was 36,913 vehicles below the actual results. Cox also said pre-tariff concerns drove customers to dealerships at larger than normal levels.\n\nCharlie Chesbrough, senior economist for Cox Automotive, told reporters March 26 that General Motors led automaker sales for the quarter, well ahead of the market, driven by sales gains in all four brands.\n\nJessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights, said March sales were particularly strong despite ongoing affordability issues and broader economic concerns.\n\n“Inventory levels were healthy for many brands, incentives continued to make a comeback, and there was clear evidence of pent-up demand after the sluggish sales years that followed 2020,” Caldwell said in a statement. “Although automotive tariffs — now set to take effect on April 2 — might have pulled ahead some vehicle purchases in Q1, the quarter’s results were largely driven by the strength of the industry’s underlying fundamentals. That said, the road ahead is less certain: These same tariffs will likely create headwinds for the industry in Q2 and beyond.”\n\nAnalysts unanimously agree that tariff impacts on 2025 sales will be less than positive. Already contending with high prices and interest rates, car shoppers should expect increased competition on dealer lots and fewer discounts.\n\nMeanwhile, the 25% tariff on all cars and light-duty trucks imported into the U.S. that's set to go into effect this week won't just cause new car prices to rise. Used car prices will also likely increase, analysts say, and selection, especially of lightly used vehicles, will dwindle.\n\n“If the market were left alone, with no massive tariff impact on automotive, we’d expect sales to see a 1-2% gain over last year, and finish near 16.3 million. That was our view just a few weeks ago,” Chesbrough said last week. “However, what seems most likely now is some tariffs, for some countries, for some period of time.”\n\nFord Motor Co. also reported first-quarter sales Tuesday, recording a 1.3% decline to 501,291 vehicles, due mostly to the timing on rental fleet sales and its discontinuation of the popular Ford Edge SUV and Transit Connect van. Ford's retail sales from dealerships rose 5%.\n\nStellantis, owner of the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat brands, said its U.S. sales fell 12% for the first quarter of 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, from 332,540 to 293,225 vehicles.\n\nThis story has been updated to accurately reflect GM's inventory levels.\n\nJackie Charniga covers General Motors for the Free Press.

Some might be hesitant to embrace Tesla’s self-driving and driver-assist technologies. CNBC reported Tesla was the leader in driver-assist crashes between June 2021 and June 2022. Although this data does not necessarily mean Tesla cars are any less safe than other cars with similar technologies, it does show there is danger associated with these developing technologies.\n\nOthers might be put off by the cost.\n\nHow much does a Tesla cost?\n\nA Tesla car could cost you from $45,000 to well over $200,000 as of June 2022, according to Motor Trend magazine.\n\nAs of June 20, 2022, a new Tesla Model 3 will run about $48,000, but think twice before you buy the cheapest model. Its battery is only designed to get you an estimated 267 miles, according to Tesla. For the Model 3 Long Range, which will get you about 67 miles farther, you can expect to pay $51,000. Ranges vary with wheel selection, says the company.\n\nAccording to Motor Trend, the Tesla Roadster, an electric sports car which the company says can hit 60 miles per hour in just 1.9 seconds, will start at around $200,000, with the limited Founders Series to cost about $250,000.\n\nWhen does the Cybertruck come out?\n\nAccording to Electrek, the release of the Cybertruck was moved from late 2021 to late 2022. Tesla is currently taking reservations, but the truck was not yet in production as of June 2022.\n\nMotor Trend estimates the single-engine Cybertruck will start at $39,900.\n\nHow do Tesla sales compare with other electric car manufacturers?\n\nAmong electric car manufacturers, Tesla is at the top in the United States, as of June 2022.\n\nIn 2021, Tesla became the first car manufacturer to sell 2 million electric cars, according to Inside EVs. According to Electrek, Tesla vehicles accounted for 79% of new electric vehicles registered in the United States in 2020.\n\nThat’s not to say Tesla doesn’t have competition. According to CNBC, Volkswagen’s chief executive has stated his intention to overtake Tesla in vehicle sales by 2025.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence suggests Volkswagen, which already leads in Europe, could overtake Tesla as early as 2024.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}]}

Medical societies issued their own hepatitis B vaccine guidelines.\n\nNow, 5 Michigan health systems say they'll disregard the recommendations of the CDC committee and continue to provide a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to babies in their first 24 hours of life.\n\nSome of Michigan's largest health systems say they will not follow the recommendations of a federal vaccine advisory panel handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which voted in early December to change longstanding immunization guidelines and delay a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for infants.\n\nInstead, five health systems — Corewell Health, Henry Ford Health, McLaren Health Care, Munson Healthcare and the University of Michigan Health — told the Detroit Free Press they will continue to provide universal hepatitis B vaccines within the first 24 hours after a child's birth.\n\nFollowing two days of meetings in early December, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the hepatitis B dose at birth only for newborns whose mothers test positive for the hepatitis B virus. For other infants, it recommended waiting two months to administer the initial dose of the vaccine and to conduct blood tests to determine whether additional booster doses are needed.\n\nWith a vote of 8-3, the committee said the change would reduce unnecessary immunizations in the first few weeks of a child's life and give parents more control.\n\nThe committee compared the U.S. childhood immunization schedule to policy in other wealthy countries, notably Denmark, which does not recommend a universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. It also suggested the risk is low for contracting hepatitis B in newborns whose mothers test negative for the virus during pregnancy.\n\nHowever, overwhelmingly, medical associations and have said the hepatitis B virus is highly contagious and can be passed to babies through contact with blood and certain body fluids not only from an infected mother during birth, but also by sharing towels, toothbrushes, nail clippers, combs or razors with an infected person. Children can get it through contact sports or exposure to contaminated medical equipment.\n\nPrevention is key, they said. The virus attacks the liver, can cause cancer and lead to liver failure and premature death. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reports that about 90% of infants infected at birth develop chronic hepatitis B infection, with 1 in 4 of these children dying prematurely from liver disease.\n\nIt causes 22,000 infections and 2,000 deaths annually in the U.S.\n\nSince the United States began universally vaccinating against hepatitis B at birth in 1991, annual infections among infants and children have dropped 99% — from 16,000 to less than 20, said Dr. Lisa Costello, chair of the state government affairs committee for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said during a Dec. 7 news conference.\n\nMany of the people who have hepatitis B don't know they're infected, as symptoms of chronic infection sometimes don't appear for years after a person contracted the virus.\n\nThe birth dose offers \"vital protection at delivery and in the days and weeks after birth, when infants may be exposed to caregivers with unrecognized infection,\" Costello said.\n\nDr. Anand Parekh, chief health policy officer at the U-M School of Public Health and senior adviser at the Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, said the hepatitis B vaccine has a proven safety record.\n\n\"We have decades and decades of safety data,\" Parekh said. \"The ACIP committee presented no new data about safety concerns, yet changed the guidelines anyway.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what it does is it adds another layer of confusion for the parents and families out there who have always looked to the CDC as a source that they could trust. Now, they hear these mixed messages. They may go online. They may consult their personal clinician, which I hope they do, but it just adds confusion in an area where, really, there is no reason to be confused. This is pretty straightforward.\"\n\nThe state health department issued a statement \"strongly\" disagreeing with the committee's decision, and urged Michigan health care providers to continue offering the birth dose of the vaccine, which is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump took to social media hours after the CDC committee made its controversial decision, and defended the change in hepatitis B vaccine recommendations. He also challenged the agency's recommended U.S. childhood vaccine schedule altogether.\n\n\"Many parents and scientists have been questioning the efficacy of this 'schedule,' as have I,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"That is why I have just signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Department of Health and Human Services to 'FAST TRACK' a comprehensive evaluation of Vaccine Schedules.\"\n\nHistorically, the ACIP has reviewed scientific data and made recommendations to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the recommendations are accepted by the agency's director, the CDC can use it to shape national health policy. Kennedy overhauled the committee earlier this year, appointing some members who are vaccine skeptics. As of Dec. 12, CDC Acting Director Jim O'Neill had not signed off on ACIP's recommended changes to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule.\n\nIt doesn't officially become CDC policy until O'Neill approves it. Insurance companies look to ACIP and CDC guidelines to determine what they will cover. State governments have the final authority over vaccine policy, however, and can set mandates, such as immunization requirements for children to enroll in public schools. States also can determine whether exemptions to those vaccine requirements are allowed.\n\nDr. Brian Tesler, McLaren Health Care's medical director of women’s health, said the Grand Blanc-based hospital system will continue to offer the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine as \"part of our standard of care, determining that this effective, safe vaccine remains in the best interest of infant’s health and the community’s protection.\"\n\n\"Though federal guidance has adjusted, our clinical leaders also consider and consult the recommendations of the various organizations establishing pre- and postnatal standards of care. ... While we remain firm in our mandate of providing safe, evidence-based care, our providers will ensure that parents are fully informed and involved in the decision-making process.\n\n\"Our providers will engage patients, inform them of their options, and support the parents in their decisions that align with their personal values and the needs of their newborn.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Detroit-based Henry Ford Health told the Free Press its recommendations \"currently remain unchanged. Any proposed changes to the newborn vaccine schedule would need to be thoroughly reviewed by the system’s immunization committee, which considers the latest scientific evidence and guidance from professional groups.\"\n\nMunson Healthcare said its eight northern Michigan hospitals also will not adopt the two-month delay in administering the hepatitis B vaccine.\n\n“We strive to use evidence-based practices to drive our medical recommendations,\" said Dr. Joe Santagelo, chief medical, quality and safety officer for the Traverse city-based health system. \"The scientific consensus is that the birth dose of hepatitis B should still be recommended to newborns, and we will continue to offer that option to our families.”\n\nCorewell Health issued a statement saying it, too, will continue to offer a birth dose to newborns, noting that the hepatitis B virus \"can have serious long-term effects, including chronic liver disease and liver cancer. If parents have questions about whether a child should receive a vaccination, they should have a conversation with their physician.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Trinity Health Michigan said in a Dec. 10 email message to the Free Press that the Livonia-based health system is still considering the ACIP recommendation.\n\n\"We’re aware of the recent policy developments and are reviewing them,\" said spokesperson Bobby Maldonado. \"No decisions have been made at this time. We’ll continue to evaluate guidance from public health authorities with patient safety as our top priority.\"\n\nDr. Pamela Rockwell, a clinical professor of family medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School and co-chair of the U-M Immunization Committee, said under Kennedy, the CDC and its vaccine advisory committee have lost credibility. Medical providers are being forced to adjust in the face of that realization.\n\n\"In my opinion, they're already irrelevant,\" she said. \"We have changed the language in all our documents that I have access to as co-chair of our immunization committee at the University of Michigan to take out any references to CDC guidelines.\"\n\nInstead, she said, U-M is following evidence-based recommendations from MDHHS, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists.\n\nIt's a big departure from the way the U.S. medical system has worked in the past.\n\n\"I do think major organizations were hesitant to go there because they also fear retaliation from the federal government, but this is about health care and doing what's right for public health and the health of our patients,\" Rockwell said. \"It's about educating the public and making sure they still have trust in their physicians and major organizations who do not have political bias.\"\n\nShe urged people with questions about vaccine safety to look for information from reputable sources, such as the medical societies and associations, iVaccinate.org and immunize.org or talk to their doctors. During the continuing medical education lectures she leads, Rockwell said she now tells physicians: \"We can no longer trust the CDC as a source for recommendations.\"\n\nDr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said professional medical associations are stepping up to fill a gap in providing vaccine recommendations that are free from bias or political influence at a time when government agencies like the CDC are losing trust.\n\n\"ACIP should be comprised of members with significant expertise and knowledge in clinical medicine, public health and immunology who are committed to providing evidence-based recommendations,\" he said. \"There should be guardrails in place to ensure that ACIP remains free from political interference so that the advisory committee panel functions as a highly credible, evidence-based source for vaccine guidance. This new ACIP has not followed the standard and transparent process that had made the advisory committee a bastion of good, evidence-based decision-making.\n\n\"They handpick data in a nontransparent way, misrepresent facts and did not have a clear, consistent, transparent process to be able to analyze it or could even explain why they were using it. ... Their information and decisions cannot be trusted.\"\n\nHe called on Trump to remove Kennedy from his position and \"restore an ACIP that we can trust.\"\n\nParekh said the CDC committee's recommendation to delay the hepatitis B vaccine for babies will further escalate vaccine hesitancy among parents, which already has driven outbreaks of measles and pertussis. Soon, we could see hepatitis B infections rise in young children, too.\n\n\"I think the irony for policymakers these days who are touting the importance of reversing the chronic disease epidemic in the United States, if you adopt this recommendation, you are tragically increasing the risk for chronic disease in children,\" Parekh said. \"It's the exact opposite effect of the MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) Commission's focus on reversing the chronic disease epidemic.\n\n\"The worry is that we're going backwards,\" he said. \"Right now, the focus should be 100% on reducing vaccine-preventable illnesses and ensuring that we can maximize uptake rates of vaccines that have been shown to be safe and effective. Instead, we seem to be questioning vaccines that have been proven to be safe and effective without any new data that has come to light.\"\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAs a summer COVID-19 surge hits Michigan and much of the U.S., there still are many unanswered questions about when updated coronavirus vaccines will be available in local pharmacies, clinics and doctors' offices, who will be eligible to get them and whether insurance plans will cover a fall booster for everyone who wants a dose.\n\n\"Everything is kind of up in the air ... with what's going to be available and what's not,\" said Farah Jalloul-Rizk, chief pharmacy officer with the Michigan Pharmacists Association.\n\nAt the center of the uncertainty is a growing rift between leading U.S. medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHe and other top Trump administration health officials changed the recommendations for who should get COVID-19 vaccines in May — saying they should no longer be given to healthy children or pregnant women — and shook up the way in which vaccines are reviewed and recommended in the U.S.\n\nThe schism could stall the arrival of newly updated COVID-19 vaccines for fall and drive more confusion about eligibility. It's led to conflicting recommendations from federal and Michigan health leaders about who should get a COVID-19 booster and might mean some people could have to pay out of pocket for the vaccines or have a co-pay this year.\n\nSome of Michigan's largest insurance companies, however, told the Detroit Free Press this past week that they will continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines for their members.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which provides health benefits to more than 4.7 million people in the state as well as to employees of Michigan-headquartered companies living outside of the state, issued a statement that said, in part: \"We want to reassure our members and customers that, at this time, there are no adjustments to our coverage for vaccines.\"\n\nMargaret Anderson, president of Health Alliance Plan of Michigan, which has 476,000 members, said in an emailed statement to the Free Press: \"Our focus is ensuring members have affordable access to preventive services. All HAP plans continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines. Members should consult their health care providers for medical advice about what’s right for them.\"\n\nPriority Health, which has 1.3 million members in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, \"currently provides coverage for the COVID-19 vaccination for people ages 6 months and older as recommended by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP),\" said Ryan Nolan, interim vice president of pharmacy for Priority Health.\n\nBut, he added: \"We continue to review the recommendations coming from the CDC’s ACIP, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, MDHHS (the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services), the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\"\n\nThose organizations aren't all in agreement about what the recommendations ought to be.\n\nWhat sparked the controversy over this year's COVID-19 boosters?\n\nThe tumult began in late May, when Kennedy Jr. announced on the social media site X that COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women would no longer be recommended because of a \"lack of clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy.\" He was joined in the videotaped announcement Drs. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Marty Makary, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe announcement was met with frustration by some medical groups, including the Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which said it would continue to \"strongly\" recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, including updated fall booster shots.\n\n\"The science has not changed,\" the association said in a statement. \"It is very clear that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants after birth.\"\n\nA couple of weeks later, Kennedy Jr. shook up traditional U.S. health policy again when he ousted all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent panel of medical and public health experts that makes vaccine recommendations to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group reviews the safety and efficacy of vaccines and helps to establish vaccine schedules to control the spread of infectious diseases.\n\n\"A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science,\" Kennedy Jr. said at the time. He then appointed eight newACIP members, including some vaccine skeptics.\n\nThose changes triggered a federal lawsuit.\n\nA pregnant physician as well as seven medical groups — including the American Academy Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Public Health Association — sued July 7 in Massachusetts, alleging that by changing U.S. COVID-19 vaccine guidelines, Kennedy Jr. and other administration officials put \"pregnant women, their unborn children, and, in fact, all children ... at grave and immediate risk of contracting a preventable disease ... with potentially irreversible long-term effects and, in some cases, death.\"\n\n\"This is not a hypothetical concern, but a pressing public health emergency that demands immediate legal action and correction,\" the complaint said.\n\nACIP, FDA clap back against medical groups\n\nBy the end of July, the newly appointed ACIP panel that Kennedy Jr. picked notified the American Medical Association and more than a half dozen other medical groups via email that they would no longer be included in reviews of scientific data about vaccines or in creating vaccine recommendations, calling the groups \"biased.\"\n\nIn response, the groups said in a joint statement they were \"deeply disappointed and alarmed that our organizations are being characterized as ‘biased’ and therefore barred from reviewing scientific data and informing the development of vaccine recommendations that have long helped ensure our nation’s vaccine program is safe, effective, and free from bias.\"\n\nThen came a concern raised by pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer, which said the FDA is considering a plan to revoke the emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, for use in healthy children younger than 5 years old.\n\nA spokesperson for Pfizer told USA TODAY: “We are currently in discussions with the agency on potential paths forward and have requested that the EUA for this age group remain in place for the 2025-2026 season. It is important to note that these deliberations are not related to the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, which continues to demonstrate a favorable profile.”\n\nThe only other COVID-19 vaccine that has been authorized for use in young children — those ages 6 months to 11 years old — in the U.S. is Moderna's Spikevax.\n\nHowever, when the FDA granted Moderna authorization for Spikevax in July, it did so with the caveat that only children with at least one underlying health condition that makes them more vulnerable to severe disease from COVID-19 should be eligible for Spikevax.\n\nIf the FDA revokes Pfizer's emergency use authorization for Comirnaty, it means there will be no COVID-19 vaccine with a greenlight for use in young, healthy American children.\n\nWhat are the current recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which has 67,000 pediatricians among its members, said the nation's infrastructure for reviewing and recommending vaccines had lost credibility. It issued its own guidelines Aug. 19 for who should get COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe group said all infants and children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years old should be vaccinated because they are at high risk for severe illness from the virus. It also recommends a single dose of vaccine for all children ages 2 to 18 who fall within the following groups:\n\nThose at high risk for severe disease with COVID-19, including those who are immunocompromised.\n\nThose who live in congregate settings, such as long-term care facilities.\n\nThose who previously have not been vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nAdditionally, children and teens whose household contacts are at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nThe most updated version of COVID-19 vaccines also should be available to children ages 2 to 18 whose parent or guardian requests it, the AAP said, even if they don't fall within the groups detailed above.\n\n“We extensively reviewed the most recently available data about COVID-19 risks in kids, as well as safety and effectiveness of available COVID-19 vaccines,\" said Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a statement. \"It's clear they are very safe for all populations. Among the reasons we decided to move to a risk-based recommendation for healthy older children is the fact that the hospitalization rate for young children and children with underlying medical conditions remains high, in line with rates for many of the other vaccine-preventable diseases for which we vaccinate.”\n\nAs of Aug. 21, CDC guidance recommends COVID-19 vaccines only for healthy people ages 65 and older and for people who are older than 6 months of age with underlying health conditions that increase their risk of severe disease from COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the agency cracked open the door to others who would like a COVID-19 vaccine, saying \"shared clinical decision-making\" should be used between a health care provider and a patient or the patient's parent/guardian to determine whether they may be vaccinated.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced in late July that its recommendation aligns with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It supports COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, and for every person 6 months and older to protect from serious illness.\n\n“There is strong evidence that supports COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and for pediatric patients,” said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, in a statement. “Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that children under 6 months of age are at the highest risk for hospitalization, and that more than 40% of those hospitalized had no underlying conditions. The COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to prevent complications of infection. We urge Michigan residents talk to their health care providers about getting vaccinated.”\n\nAre any other federal advisory panels likely to see changes?\n\nThe CDC's ACIP isn't the only advisory panel that could be in Kennedy Jr.'s crosshairs.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in late July that Kennedy Jr. also is considering a plan to replace all 16 of the members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which since 2010 has determined which types of preventive medical care — including cancer screenings, medication, counseling services and tests — must be fully covered by insurance companies.\n\nThe Journal's sources said Kennedy Jr. views the task force members as too “woke.\"\n\nIn response, the American Medical Association (AMA) sent a letter to Kennedy Jr. and expressed “deep concern.” It urged him to reconsider any plan that would remove current members from the task force.\n\n“USPSTF plays a critical, non-partisan role in guiding physicians’ efforts to prevent disease and improve the health of patients by helping to ensure access to evidence-based clinical preventive services,” the AMA said in its letter.\n\nWhat other changes are on the horizon?\n\nIn June, the newly appointed ACIP panel recommended that a preservative called thimerosal be removed from all flu vaccines in the U.S. Kennedy Jr. signed off on the recommendation in July, requiring manufacturers to change the formulation for flu vaccines to remove the organic compound, which contains mercury, and has been in use since the 1930s to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi in multiuse vaccine vials.\n\nJalloul-Rizk of the Michigan Pharmacists Association said even before ACIP voted to remove thimerosal from flu vaccines, there already was very limited use of the preservative, which has been largely phased out the U.S. supply.\n\n\"It was mostly used in the multidose vials,\" she said. \"That's because when you have a multidose vial, you're going in multiple times with a needle, and every time you go in, you can contaminate the vial. ... It is not found in single-dose vials. It's not an issue for most pharmacies.\"\n\nKennedy Jr. heralded the ACIP decision, saying: “After more than two decades of delay, this action fulfills a long-overdue promise to protect our most vulnerable populations from unnecessary mercury exposure. Injecting any amount of mercury into children when safe, mercury-free alternatives exist defies common sense and public health responsibility.\"\n\nJalloul-Rizk said she doesn't expect to see any other changes to flu vaccines this season.\n\n\"The guidance is still the same for that one,\" she said. \"We're looking for a rollout at the end of August,\" with widespread availability of the updated flu vaccine in pharmacies by mid-September.\n\n\"We encourage everyone to get the flu vaccine in September and October. The vaccine takes about two weeks to fully show efficacy, so September-October is the most ideal time for someone to come in,\" she said.\n\nBut when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccine, she said, there's still a lack of clarity about what will be available, when it will be available and whether all insurance plans will cover it for all people.\n\n\"With changes in the CDC guidelines, I have not heard of any change in coverage or in the age groups who are going to be covered,\" she said. \"We have asked, but we have not heard anything yet. ... The uncertainty of it, that has been an issue.\"\n\nFor now, she said, Michigan pharmacists are adhering to the CDC's recommendations and its \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance for anyone who is healthy, under the age of 65 and wants a dose of the vaccine.\n\n\"It can still be offered if the parent requests it, and it's agreed upon by a (medical) provider,\" Jalloul-Rizk said.\n\nWhich types of COVID-19 vaccines will be available this fall?\n\nThe FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee met in May to make recommendations on updated COVID-19 vaccines to be considered for use starting this fall.\n\nThe committee suggested vaccine manufacturers should develop formulations that target the JN.1 lineage of the virus, preferentially using the LP.8.1 strain.\n\nBut the FDA has yet to authorize any updated COVID-19 vaccine for the fall season, and it's unclear how soon that might happen or when doses will be available.\n\nStill, the following manufacturers are ramping up production of their COVID-19 vaccines, with hopes they'll win approval:\n\nModerna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax, can be used in the U.S. in people who are 65 or older and for those who are 6 months to 64 years old with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, may see its emergency use authorization revoked for use in healthy children younger than 5 years old. Last year, the FDA allowed Comirnaty to be used in Americans ages of 6 months and older.\n\nNovavax and Sanofi's COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid. It's a protein-based vaccine that does not use mRNA technology and is approved for use in Americans ages 65 and older as well as those who are between the ages of 12 and 64 who have at least one underlying medical condition, such as asthma, cancer, diabetes or obesity, that puts them at higher risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.\n\nThomas Grenier, Sanofi’s head of vaccines for North America, told the Detroit Free Press: \"We are working closely with the U.S. health authorities and our customers to make Nuvaxovid ... available nationwide this upcoming season. Pending final FDA regulatory approvals, we expect the product to become available in the early fall.

Kressly told USA TODAY: \"This attack on the integrity of pediatricians is unfortunate, but it does not change the facts.​ For nearly a century, the American Academy of Pediatrics' mission has focused on ​one thing: following the science to best protect children's health.\"\n\nAnd still, cases of the coronavirus continue to spread in the U.S.\n\nThe CDC reported that as of Aug. 12, the number of COVID-19 infections were growing or likely growing in 34 states, including Michigan.

Always making decisions based on the health and safety of our students and staff is our No. 1 priority, while recognizing that people are going to have different opinions.\"\n\nMerritt revealed that approximately 900 students had applied for the district's full-time virtual academy. A second registration window — registration information can be found on the district's website — has been opened until Aug. 16.\n\n\"Interestingly, families who registered for our virtual academy are now wanting to switch to in-person, so we're honoring their ability to look at different options.\"\n\nMerritt said the Plymouth-Canton Schools educational team has stood tall during the unpredictable days of the pandemic.\n\n\"I'm very proud of our team,\" Merritt said. \"There is no blueprint to dealing with something like this; there hasn't been a pandemic for over 100 years.

Medical societies issued their own hepatitis B vaccine guidelines.\n\nNow, 7 Michigan health systems say they'll disregard the recommendations of the CDC committee and continue to offer a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to babies in their first 24 hours of life.\n\nBoth Trinity Health Michigan and MyMichigan Health say their hospitals will join five other major health systems in the state to continue universally offering parents of newborns a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for their babies within 24 hours of birth, despite a recommendation earlier in December from a federal advisory panel to delay the immunization.\n\nThat means that in the majority of Michigan hospitals — from West Branch to Wyandotte and Grand Rapids to Gaylord — the vaccine will be available to newborns even though the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, voted Dec. 5 to reverse long-standing policy and recommended waiting at least two months to offer it to infants.\n\nThe other Michigan health systems that plan to continue offering the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine are Corewell Health, Henry Ford Health, McLaren Health Care, Munson Healthcare and University of Michigan Health. When combined with the Trinity Health Michigan and MyMichigan Health systems, they comprise 84 of the state's 129 acute-care hospitals, according to the Michigan Health and Hospital Association.\n\nDr. Caesar Gonzales II, Trinity Health Michigan’s chief clinical officer, said the Livonia-based health system isn't changing its standing practice, which is \"firmly grounded in decades of scientific evidence and supported by numerous leading medical organizations, including the Michigan Advisory (Committee) on Immunizations, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\"\n\n\"Delaying the birth dose increases health risks for newborns,\" Gonzales said in an emailed statement to the Detroit Free Press. \"It is essential to protect infants from hepatitis B, which may cause lifelong chronic infection, liver failure, and cancer. We strongly support the universal hepatitis B birth dose recommendation and encourage all parents to discuss vaccinations with their health care provider.\"\n\nFollowing two days of meetings in early December, the federal vaccine advisory panel handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recommended the initial hepatitis B dose at birth only for newborns whose mothers test positive for the hepatitis B virus. For other infants, it recommended waiting two months to administer the vaccine and to conduct blood tests to determine whether additional booster doses are needed.\n\nWith a vote of 8-3, the committee said the change would reduce unnecessary immunizations in the first few weeks of a child's life and give parents more control.\n\nKennedy Jr., who founded the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, in June fired the committee's previous 17 independent experts and replaced them with a group that largely supports his views, as part of an effort to remake U.S. vaccine policy.\n\nThe committee compared the U.S. childhood immunization schedule to policy in other wealthy countries, notably Denmark, which does not recommend a universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. It also suggested the risk is low for contracting hepatitis B in newborns whose mothers test negative for the virus during pregnancy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an order directing his administration to consider aligning immunization practices with those of \"peer, developed countries.\" On social media, he called the current U.S. vaccine schedule \"ridiculous.\"\n\nAccording to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, most European countries do not recommend a universal birth dose, but do recommend vaccinating babies at 2 or 3 months old. Only Denmark, Finland, Hungary and Iceland advise hepatitis B vaccination only for a selective group.\n\nAdam Langer, a CDC disease expert on staff for nearly 20 years, said during his presentation that the United States is not comparable to Denmark, which has a total population of 6 million, universal health care and a more thorough screening process for the virus.\n\nMany of Kennedy's committee members criticized the vaccine as unsafe, despite decades of evidence to the contrary.\n\n\"People should be very, very suspicious when people tell them that something is safe, especially a vaccine,\" said committee member Retsef Levi, a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nOverwhelmingly, however, medical associations have said no new data was presented by the committee to support the premise that the vaccine is unsafe.\n\nThe hepatitis B virus is highly contagious and can be passed to babies through contact with blood and certain body fluids not only from an infected mother during birth, but also by sharing towels, toothbrushes, nail clippers, combs or razors with an infected person. Children can get it through contact sports or exposure to contaminated medical equipment and at day care centers.\n\nDelaying the first dose of the vaccine could put many babies at risk of contracting the virus from caregivers who don't know they're infected before infants can be immunized.\n\nThe virus can cause cancer and lead to liver failure and premature death. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reports that about 90% of infants infected at birth develop chronic hepatitis B infection, with one in four of these children dying prematurely from liver disease.\n\nIt causes 22,000 infections and 2,000 deaths annually in the United States.\n\nDr. Anurag Malani, an infectious disease specialist who is the vice chief of staff at Trinity Health Ann Arbor and the medical director of the antimicrobial stewardship and health care epidemiology programs, said scientific evidence supports giving a birth dose to newborns.\n\n\"It's been part of the universal vaccine schedule since 1991,\" he told the Free Press in a Dec. 15 interview. \"We have a lot of data to support its continued use. ... It's a safe, effective vaccine.\"\n\nToo many pregnant mothers-to-be aren't getting screened for hepatitis B, and don't know their status when they deliver their babies, Malani said.\n\n\"Almost 16% of pregnant women from 2015-2019 ... didn't get screened\" for hepatitis B, Malani said. \"That's pretty alarming.\"\n\nThat, he said, puts vulnerable newborns at risk for slipping through the cracks and failing to get the birth dose when they most need protection, he said.\n\nAdditionally, delaying the vaccine by two months also means some babies also will go without immunization at all because they may miss follow-up appointments and preventive visits when the vaccine should be administered.\n\n\"This disproportionately affects those who have difficulty getting to appointments ... people who are already disadvantaged,\" Malani said. \"It will widen that gap. When you create barriers for a vaccine ... it is going to increase inequities that already exist.\"\n\nSince the United States began universally vaccinating against hepatitis B at birth in 1991, annual infections among infants and children have dropped 99% — from 16,000 to less than 20, Malani said.\n\n\"That just shows the universal hepatitis vaccine is an effective strategy,\" he said. \"It's an astonishing success. ... We're talking about a hepatitis B series at birth and throughout the first six months of life that essentially gives you lifelong protection.\n\n\"The universal hepatitis B vaccine recommendation really is making Americans healthy again.\"\n\nParents, Malani said, always have the option to decline to vaccinate their children, but the best thing for any parent to do is to talk to their child's pediatrician or family physician about it.\n\n\"There's a lot of misinformation and disinformation out there,\" he said. \"I think it's hard for the public to understand what is necessarily true.\"\n\nHistorically, the ACIP has reviewed scientific data and made recommendations to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the recommendations are accepted by the agency's director, the CDC can use it to shape national health policy.\n\nAs of Dec. 15, CDC Acting Director Jim O'Neill had not signed off on ACIP's recommended changes to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule. It doesn't officially become CDC policy until O'Neill approves it.\n\nInsurance companies look to ACIP and CDC guidelines to determine what they will cover. State governments have the final authority over vaccine policy, however, and can set mandates, such as immunization requirements for children to enroll in public schools. States also can determine whether exemptions to those vaccine requirements are allowed.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that \"science is not political,\" Malani said. \"Science helps inform medical decision making. We have trials and we have years, and years and years of data. We try to make evidence-based decisions.\n\n\"If you're ... confused with what's going on and why ACIP isn't supporting universal vaccination at birth anymore, then I think it's really important that you have these discussions with your pediatrician or your physician and talk about what's happening. There are all kinds of sources of information out there.\n\n\"Going forward, I don't know whether looking at the CDC website is going to be a trusted source. But your local health care provider is a trusted source, so we are encouraging those discussions to happen. It's a good starting point.\"\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Kennedy Jr. unilaterally changed COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, limiting recommended vaccination to those over 65 and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nThe changes bypass the usual expert panel review process and may limit insurance coverage for those outside the recommended groups.\n\nMedical experts express concern over the lack of transparency and supporting data for the changes, particularly the removal of recommendations for pregnant women and children.\n\nThe decision raises questions about vaccine access and contradicts Kennedy's prior statements on respecting individual medical choices.\n\nSeveral medical organizations urge insurers to continue covering the vaccine for all, emphasizing the importance of individual choice and protection against severe outcomes.\n\nMost Americans have decided that they're done getting vaccinated against COVID-19, but there are still reasons to consider it, and it remains an essential protection for some.\n\nThat's why many doctors and medical organizations are concerned about changes to the vaccine recommendations made single-handedly by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nUnder the changes Kennedy announced in a social media post on May 27 and others announced a week prior by two of his appointees, the only people who will be recommended for COVID-19 vaccines are those over 65 and people with existing health problems.\n\nThese changes, which bypassed the normal protocol, will likely make it harder for others who want the COVID-19 vaccine to get it, including healthcare workers and healthy people under 65 with a vulnerable family member or those who want to reduce their short-term risk of infection.\n\nKennedy specifically changed the recommendations so pregnant women and healthy children aren't included, though it's not clear if that's just for booster shots or whether it would also include a baby's first COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nInsurance coverage typically follows federal recommendations, so anyone who is healthy and under 65 is likely to have to pay out of pocket to get the shot ‒ which runs about $200 ‒ if they can get it.\n\nLimiting access in this way, several medical experts said, contradicts Kennedy's previous statements about how he'd handle vaccines. It also runs counter to the general practice of medicine, which supports people making medical decisions in collaboration with their doctor, they said.\n\n\"I think we can treat people respectfully and show them the information and let them make their own decisions,\" said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University.\n\nHe and others said they're especially concerned that these policy changes are happening without supporting data or the typical scientific review by two panels of experts.\n\n\"We haven't been presented with one shred of information to show that this step is needed at this time,\" Goodman said. \"If it is, fine, but present that publicly, use the advisory committees and let's have a transparent process.\"\n\nWho still needs a vaccine?\n\nThe federal government has stopped tracking COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths, but local data shows they are still happening in every age group, with two-thirds of hospitalizations in those 65 and up.\n\nMeanwhile, safety data on the vaccines continues to show that serious side effects are extremely rare, leading most specialists and expert organizations to conclude that it's still worthwhile to get the vaccine.\n\nWhile the vaccine is most important for people in vulnerable groups, such as those over 65 and people with health conditions, a booster remains useful for everyone, even children, several experts and disease organizations told USA TODAY.\n\n\"What is clear is that pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,\" Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement.\n\nShould children get the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nHealthy kids will no longer be recommended for COVID-19 vaccines, according to Kennedy's policy announcement.\n\nFewer than 5% of children received the COVID-19 vaccine between the fall of 2023 and the fall of 2024, data shows. Yet COVID-19 continues to lead to about as many hospitalizations in children as the flu, at about 100 hospitalizations for every 100,000 kids under 4.\n\nOn balance, the vaccine still provides a benefit, said Dr. Melissa Stockwell, division chief of child and adolescent health at Columbia University. \"The point of a booster is to give protection against whatever the current circulating variant is and shorter-term protection against infection, but what we're really looking for is protection against severe outcomes,\" said Stockwell.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine has repeatedly been found to be safe in children, though every vaccine carries some risk. Most notably with the COVID-19 vaccines, adolescent boys and young men were at somewhat higher risk for a rare heart problem known as myocarditis. But that risk has dropped dramatically since the early days of vaccination when the initial two doses were given relatively close together, Stockwell said.\n\nWhat remains unclear ‒ and of much higher concern to most pediatricians and infectious disease experts ‒ is whether Kennedy's new policy covers all shots or just boosters. Children between 6 months and 2 years are at high risk for severe COVID-19 because they've not been exposed to it before, just as everyone was at higher risk when the virus was new.\n\nAnd vaccination, including boosters, reduces the risk for long COVID, in which symptoms can linger for months or even years after a COVID-19 infection. Stockwell, who said she would get boosters for her own children, cited research showing that vaccines reduce the risk of long COVID in children by 60%.\n\nA new study in JAMA Pediatrics shows that children younger than 2 who had been infected with COVID were more likely to experience trouble sleeping, fussiness, poor appetite, a stuffy nose and cough, while preschoolers, aged 3 to 5, who had been infected were more likely to have low energy, daytime tiredness and a dry cough than children who avoided infection.\n\nThe study found that roughly 1 in 7 previously infected children meet the criteria for long COVID.\n\n\"For parents who want their children to be vaccinated, we want them to have that opportunity,\" Stockwell said.\n\nIs it risky to skip COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy?\n\nThe new policy removes the recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. This concerns a number of obstetricians, infectious disease specialists and pediatricians.\n\nPregnant women are at high risk for severe disease and studies show that the likelihood of miscarriage, stillbirth and pregnancy complications like preeclampsia, blood clots, heart and kidney damage and hypertension are much higher among women who develop COVID-19 during pregnancy.\n\nNewborns are also at very high risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. Any respiratory infection is more dangerous in newborns than in others, because their airways are so small. Plus, they have never been exposed to COVID-19 before. Vaccinating during pregnancy protects newborns until they are old enough to get their own shot, Stockwell said.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine has also been shown to be extremely safe during pregnancy and far safer than a COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, which has expertise in high-risk pregnancy, issued a statement saying the society \"strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine, the society said, \"is safe to be given at any point during pregnancy. Maternal immunization is also associated with improved infant outcomes and decreased complications, including maternal and infant hospitalizations. \"\n\nWhat's the process for changing vaccine recommendations?\n\nChanges to the vaccine schedule are typically made after federal officials solicit recommendations from two panels of experts in infectious disease, pediatrics and other relevant specialties. The heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration then review the decisions of their respective panels and issue a joint recommendation.\n\nKennedy's unilateral decision breaks with this practice. It will likely make many families wonder whether the vaccine is safe.\n\n\"It can be confusing to families, particularly when there's conflicting information about vaccination,\" Stockwell said.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also raised concerns about Kennedy's disregard for the normal procedure of changing vaccine recommendations. In his brief comments on social media on May 27, he didn't mention consulting any doctors or panels.\n\n\"This decision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall,\" Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement.\n\n\"By removing the recommendation, the decision could strip families of choice. Those who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage remain unclear,\" he said.\n\nIn the wake of Kennedy's statement, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) urged insurers to continue to cover the COVID-19 vaccine for everyone, including the groups Kennedy said the government would no longer recommend get the shot.\n\n\"IDSA strongly urges insurers to maintain coverage for COVID-19 vaccines so that all Americans can make the best decisions to protect themselves and their families against severe illness, hospitalization and death,\" society president Dr. Tina Tan said in a statement. \"IDSA also urges Congress to conduct meaningful and necessary oversight to ensure appropriate decision-making processes at the Department of Health and Human Services, which will impact people of all ages.\"\n\nContributed: Adrianna Rodriguez", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/06/21/providers-talk-how-pandemic-affected-mental-health-cape-cod/7730772002/", "title": "Providers talk about how pandemic affected mental health on Cape ...", "text": "June 21, 2021, 4:00 a.m. ET\n\nIt can be overwhelming to think about the ways in which the pandemic has changed all our lives.\n\nSomething that many have struggled with during these difficult times has been mental health.\n\nAt a forum Thursday, organized by the Cape Cod Foundation, representatives of non-profit organizations on the Cape that provide mental and behavioral health services talked about the impact the pandemic has had on their organizations as well as the communities they serve.\n\nThe presenters were Allie Anderson, chief clinical officer of Gosnold, Inc., Karen Gardner, chief executive officer of Community Health Center of Cape Cod, and Cindy Horgan, executive director of Cape Cod Children’s Place. The panel was moderated by Kristin O’Malley, president and CEO of the Cape Cod Foundation.\n\nChange in needs during pandemic\n\nSome of the major impacts of the pandemic, presenters said, included an emphasis on providing necessities, a transition to telehealth and a rise in substance abuse.\n\nOne of the most significant changes for Cape Cod Children's Place, Horgan said, was that it began to emphasize on providing “concrete needs” for families, such as food and money for early education and care.\n\nCOVID-19 mental health: Traumas to linger even as pandemic eases on Cape Cod\n\nPrior to the pandemic the Children’s Place did have a small food pantry, distributing food became more pronounced with the pandemic.\n\nHorgan said the Children's Place had recently reached $39,000 in donated Stop & Shop Grocery Store cards that it had distributed to families.\n\nGardner said her organization has had a significant increase in the number of calls. Part of that had to do with medical and health centers being closed, she said. Community Health, she said, received monthly 200 to 300 new applications from patients during the pandemic.\n\n“...One of the most striking things that we saw was the increase in disparities,” said Gardner.\n\nGardner spoke of a colleague, a complex care nurse, who said people the center treats are already “hanging by a thread.” These “most vulnerable” populations, who live in poverty, saw disparities increase.\n\nAnderson said the pandemic saw a significant increase in her organization’s substance use outpatient services. She noted that Gosnold, Inc.’s general outpatient service program also saw a 50% increase.\n\n“I think that just speaks to the isolation of people, and the fear and anxiety that this pandemic really caused,” Anderson said.\n\nDespite the radical shift to telehealth, Despite the pandemic's forced isolation, the transition to virtual medical care did have some benefits.\n\nAnderson noted that telehealth allows Gosnold to reach people that staffers wouldn’t otherwise be able to, such as people living in isolated parts of the state, or people with a lack of time.\n\nDifficulties with telehealth\n\nSome of the difficulties of telehealth.Anderson noted, were that some students who would normally receive mental health services during school hours could no longer do so. Additionally, many students were less comfortable receiving telehealth services at home, which did not provide adequate privacy.\n\nEvery presenter stated that their organization would likely continue to use a hybrid system, including telehealth.\n\nThe value of in-person connection was not understated, however, as Anderson noted that specifically those dealing with substance abuse cravea face-to-face style of treatment. Some have also talked about “zoom burnout,” or, being tired of long sessions on video chat platforms.\n\nGardner also said patients may not be receiving necessary testing if they do not come in in-person, such as diagnostic and chronic care testing, etc.\n\nOn May 18, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did release a statement that The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration would be distributing $3 billion in American Rescue Plan funding.\n\nModerator O’Malley noted that many of the specifics of state and federal relief money were unclear.\n\nHowever, she did want to know, generally, how organizations could best use the money.\n\nOne of the main ideas discussed was the desire to make sure organizations were paying their workforces adequately.

The agency manages college loans for nearly 2 million Pennsylvanians, seeks to protect students from discrimination and provides more than $1.6 billion annually to the commonwealth’s schools, much of that directed to the communities most in need.\n\n“The proposed dismantling of the department of education would be disastrous for Pennsylvania students, particularly those who are most marginalized by our education system,” said Maura McInerney, legal director for the Pennsylvania-based Education Law Center.\n\nAbolishing the agency would require an act of Congress, and experts say that's unlikely to happen. However, a think tank chaired by Trump's pick for education secretary, Linda McMahon, has proposed stripping federal officials of various roles and giving them to the states \"while Congress works to sunset the department.\"\n\nAnd Project 2025, a conservative think tank's wishlist for the Trump administration, details a plan to transfer many of the department’s responsibilities to other parts of the federal government. The Justice Department would help uphold civil rights in education, the U.S. Census Bureau would take on data collection and the Health and Human Services Department would run funding programs for low-income schools and students with disabilities.\n\nRachel Langan with the conservative-leaning Commonwealth Foundation said most concerns about abolishing the education agency seem unfounded, especially in Pennsylvania, which she said would handle most tasks better than the federal government.\n\n“Pennsylvania is going to take care of kids in Pennsylvania,” said Langan, the foundation's senior education policy analyst. “So I don’t think that we here have a lot to fear from what happens at the U.S. Department of Education.”\n\nSchool choice, prayer, student loans: What education could look like under Trump, Vance\n\nWho would investigate discrimination complaints at Pa. schools?\n\nOne leading concern among public school advocates is the education department might lose some of its power to protect student civil rights at K-12 schools and institutions of higher learning.\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights is investigating nearly 335 cases at Pennsylvania grade schools, colleges and universities, according to its website. More than a third of those involve accusations of disability discrimination, about a third are related to alleged sex discrimination and most of the remainder deal with racial discrimination claims.\n\nThe agency is reviewing allegations, for instance, that Central Bucks School District created a hostile environment for LGBTQ students. And the department in October found that Norwin School District in Westmoreland County had violated civil rights laws by failing to curb blatant acts of racism, with students wearing confederate flag shirts to an annual spirit day event and using slurs in group chats.\n\nThe department this year has also looked into numerous claims of discrimination against Jewish students, including in Philadelphia schools.\n\nProject 2025, a playbook crafted by the conservative Heritage Foundation, calls for shifting the education department's watchdog role to the U.S. Department of Justice, which would only be able to enforce anti-discrimination laws through litigation rather than conducting investigations. (Trump distanced himself from Project 2025 during the presidential campaign but has recruited a number of its authors for key roles in his administration.)\n\nWhile the Department of Justice could hypothetically handle these types of complaints, McInerney said, the civil rights wing of the education agency has specialized in a nuanced and complex part of the law.\n\n“We need this enforcement,” she said, “to combat what we’re seeing as an escalation in bullying and harassment of students, which is creating hostile learning environments for many children of color, children with disabilities, those who identify as LGBTQ youth and other underserved student populations.”\n\nWhat might happen to federal funding for Pa. schools?\n\nIt’s not clear if Trump’s administration will try to pull back or end any of the federal funding streams that go to Pennsylvania, though he did attempt to slash a number of K-12 programs during his previous term.\n\nThe Keystone State gets $762 million each year in Title I funding, money meant to serve children in underperforming public schools, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. As of the 2021-22 school year, the federal government was also providing nearly half a billion dollars in funding for Pennsylvania children with disabilities, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nHowever, conservatives, including McMahon's American First Policy Institute, have complained that federal dollars come with too many strings attached and argue that the government uses money to advance a progressive agenda in local schools.\n\nProject 2025 proposes putting the bulk of disability education money and Title I funding for low-income schools into block grants distributed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nEd Fuller, a Penn State University education professor, said the strings connected with this funding aren't aimed at smuggling so-called woke ideologies into schools and are largely there to ensure the money benefits students, he said.\n\nOffered rule-free grants, many states might divert the money away from special education or underperforming schools, he said.\n\n\"I think a lot of the very red states would very likely just enact tax cuts,\" he said.\n\nPolicymakers might also decide to split funding evenly across all schools rather than targeting impoverished areas or special education students, according to Fuller. This approach would be particularly damaging in Pennsylvania, where the education funding system has already been deemed unconstitutional for its wealth-related disparities.\n\nThe uncertainty around the fate of federal education aid is already creating anxiety for some local school officials.\n\nIn the Greater Johnstown School District, one of the poorest in Pennsylvania, this funding is a lifeline, helping make up for property tax revenues that fall far short of offering enough support for public education.\n\nFederal funding accounts for about 12% of the district’s budget and nearly a quarter of its money for special education, paying for 20 mental health professionals and 13 teachers and paraeducators, Superintendent Amy Arcurio said.\n\nShe said disabled students represent a large percentage of the district’s population, and the funding allows these children to “remain educated with their peers and friends.” Without these resources, she said, Greater Johnstown might have to send some of these students to other districts to access appropriate services.\n\nAnd teachers supported by Title I money for low-income schools work with young students on reading proficiency, a foundation for success in higher grades, she said. In a district that struggles with poverty, some kids come from homes without access to books. Some have never picked up a book in their lives and don’t know how to hold it or find the cover.\n\n“When you’re in a district like ours and over 93% of our students are growing up in poverty, we are behind the eight-ball right away,” she said. “And without those Title I funds, that would be really detrimental to us.”\n\nWhat would happen with federal student loans?\n\nMore than 1.86 million Pennsylvanians hold a collective total of $67.5 billion in federal student debt, according to the education department, so changes to the way the government handles these loans could have sweeping impacts in the commonwealth.\n\nAnd the botched rollout of the new federal student aid application earlier this year only fueled criticism of the department’s performance in running these programs.\n\n“That could potentially be shifted to the states, and the states might do a better job,” said Langan, whose own children struggled with the new form.\n\nOfficials during Trump's first term talked about moving student loan functions over to the Treasury Department.\n\nNick Hillman, an education professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the government could realize some “bureaucratic efficiencies” by handing this job over to the Treasury, which is already involved in collecting defaulted loans.\n\nWhile that’s an idea worth examining, policymakers should demand cost-benefit comparisons and other evidence that it would be advantageous, he said.\n\nAnd there are a host of other potential student loan reforms being floated on the right.\n\nThe America First Policy Institute has proposed giving universities more \"skin in the game\" in the student debt crisis by holding institutions responsible when their graduates default on loans. The system should also incentivize students not to borrow large sums when pursuing degrees that have a \"low return on investment,\" according to the institute.\n\nProject 2025 advances the idea of restoring private involvement in the student loan process, undoing Obama-era reforms that pushed commercial banks out of the federal loan process.\n\nThese changes have cost the government upward of $500 million, according to Axios, but they have given policymakers more power to extend relief to student borrowers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden sought to flex that authority by forgiving more than $400 billion in student debt, an initiative struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2023. Some of his subsequent attempts to deliver relief — such as by creating a program to make loan repayments more affordable — could fizzle out during the Trump term, even if the Republican president doesn’t succeed in shuttering the entire agency, Hillman said.\n\n“I think borrowers right now are concerned and confused about, ‘How much is my payment going to be for the next 10 years?’” he said. “That’s going to continue to change and, I think, become even more uncertain under the Trump administration.”\n\nBethany Rodgers is a USA TODAY Network Pennsylvania capital bureau investigative journalist.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/health/fda-food-safety-report", "title": "In wake of baby formula crisis, critical report recommends major food ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTo help prevent outbreaks of food-related illness and problems like the formula shortage that left many parents in the US without adequate access to food for their babies, the US Food and Drug Administration needs a clearer mission and a different kind of leadership, and it has to act with more urgency, according to a highly critical new report.\n\nAfter the agency faced serious criticism for its handling of the formula shortage, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf commissioned the review of the Human Foods Program in July from the Reagan-Udall Foundation, an independent group of experts.\n\nThe need for a review was considered so urgent that Califf asked the group to submit the report in 60 business days – lightning speed for government-focused reports. It was submitted to the FDA on Tuesday.\n\nAbout 48 million Americans get some kind of foodborne illness every year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die. Produce alone in 2019 was responsible for 46% of foodborne illness outbreaks, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe FDA oversees the safety of 78% of the US human food supply.\n\nIt enforces food safety regulations, works with local governments on food safety information, promotes dietary guidelines, and develops food safety information and education, as well as overseeing nutrition labels on most food and being responsible for promoting good nutrition practices to the US public.\n\nThe US food supply is generally recognized as safe, the Reagan-Udall Foundation’s report said, but the FDA needs to be much more proactive in dealing with foodborne pathogens in order to protect Americans.\n\n“An approach that is primarily focused on identifying and reacting to acute outbreaks of foodborne illness and death is unacceptable,” the report says.\n\nAmericans’ nutrition can also improve, the report says. Most people don’t follow the US dietary recommendations, and more than a million die of diseases that can be linked to diet such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer each year, according to the FDA\n\n“Relying solely on food labeling and consumer education to drive the needed changes in the food supply is also an unacceptable strategy for reducing diet-related chronic diseases,” the new report says.\n\nMajor changes recommended\n\nThe report suggests that the agency needs major reform in order to do a better job managing food in the US. Some of the proposed changes would require congressional approval.\n\nThe report has several suggestions for ways to reach these goals. One would create a separate Center for Nutrition within the US Department of Health and Human Services. Another would have the FDA develop a strategy to increase funding for the Human Foods Program, with help from Congress. The agency could also connect its technology systems so they better communicate with each other.\n\nThe FDA could seek to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow the disclosure of more information to local agencies. Or it could get regulatory authority to request records from food manufacturers in advance or in lieu of inspection.\n\nThe report recommends that the FDA explore applying its authority to require infant formula manufacturers, for instance, to keep microbiological testing records that are available on request so there is real-time disclosure of results.\n\nIt also suggests that the FDA use its mandatory recall authority more often and that there should be a process by which accommodations are made for products that are considered life-sustaining, like formula. At the moment, food recalls are usually voluntarily initiated by a manufacturer or food distributor.\n\nThe report also notes that the food program is run under the leadership of several managers. This “lack of a single, clearly identified person” to lead the program has led to a culture of “constant turmoil” and “indecisiveness and inaction” that has created “disincentives for collaboration,” according to the report.\n\nThat turmoil was partly to blame for the agency’s problematic handling of the formula shortage, the report says.\n\nExperts have said the agency failed to act quickly enough on sanitation complaints at an Abbott Nutrition formula manufacturing facility in Michigan, and because of a lack of communication across departments, it didn’t circumvent what became a massive shortage of formula after the plant shut down.\n\n“A review of events indicates that lack of communication and engagement across the Agency accounted, in part, for missteps,” the new report says. “There was little motivation, and apparently no requirement, to share information and interact across the Agency to facilitate critical thinking and proactive decision-making.\n\n“This is especially problematic in a crisis, where decisions should be made quickly and be vetted properly.”\n\nThe report suggests that the FDA create a new structure with clear roles and leaders. It also encourages development of a culture that is more transparent, that acts quickly and collaborates.\n\n“The current culture of the FDA Human Foods Program is inhibiting its ability to effectively accomplish this goal” of protecting public health,” the report says.\n\n‘A new vision’\n\nCaliff said Tuesday that the agency has not had the opportunity to review the report in depth but that the report provides “significant observations” and options to consider.\n\n“The work of these independent evaluators will help to inform a new vision for the FDA Human Foods Program,” Califf said in a news release.\n\nSome critics have suggested that food safety takes a back seat to the FDA’s regulations of drugs and medical devices. Califf acknowledged that food policy was important to the agency, citing the decline in life expectancy in the US largely due to chronic diseases that can be improved with good nutrition.\n\n“The Human Foods Program is a top priority for the agency. America’s food supply is as safe as it’s ever been,” he said. “That said, over the past several years, the program has been stressed by the increasing diversity and complexity of the nation’s food systems and supply chain, the ongoing impacts associated with climate change and rapid advances in the science underlying many of the foods we eat today.”\n\nThe FDA will inform the public about how it is moving forward on the panel’s suggestions by the end of January and will provide additional updates at the end of February, including on any structural or procedural changes it will make, Califf said.\n\nHe said he’s putting together a group of leaders at the FDA that will advise him on how to “operationalize these findings,” and he expects these leaders to be “bold and focused on the transformative opportunities ahead for the FDA’s food program.”\n\n‘A very encouraging first step’\n\nIn April, a coalition of 30 organizations that represent industry, local regulators and consumers sent a letter to the FDA asking for the creation of a deputy commissioner for foods with direct line authority over all the agency’s food components.\n\nOne of the organizations, Consumer Reports, has called for months for more accountability and focused leadership from the FDA.\n\n“We need strengthened leadership and accountability at the FDA to implement a culture of prevention, respond more quickly to problems as they arise, and take timely action on proposed food safety rules and initiatives,” Brian Ronholm, Consumer Reports’ director of food policy, said Tuesday.\n\nRonholm called the new report a “very encouraging first step.”\n\n“We cannot afford to tolerate the status quo and let this moment go by without adopting fundamental changes to improve the FDA’s ability to protect the public and ensure our food is safe,” he said in a statement.\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, a trade association for food manufacturers that also signed the April letter, said Tuesday that the lack of a single leader on food policy leads to “a lot of inefficiencies.”\n\n“A siloed approach across FDA makes it harder for industry to engage,” said Sarah Gallo, the organization’s vice president for product policy. “It is just really complicated when you don’t have somebody looking over the different parts of the agency that have some form of jurisdiction over all those things.\n\n“We can’t ignore what happened with the formula crisis,” Gallo added, a tangible example of what can happen when the FDA is not functioning at its best.\n\nRoberta Wagner, vice president of regulatory and technical affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, agreed that if there were one person in charge, they could make sure the inspection and policy parts of the FDA would work together.\n\nWagner added that the food industry has embraced a more prevention-oriented kind of philosophy when it comes to safety. “Quite frankly, the problem is, FDA’s inspection force has not modernized itself or its approaches to basically mirror that prevention-oriented system and philosophy,” Wagner said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe FDA food division has its work cut out for it, though, added Wagner, who worked with the agency in several capacities before joining the association.\n\n“Think about it: The FDA has to keep up with hundreds of thousands of farms and facilities,” she said. “If you have these siloed operations, you’re not having these really critical conversations about where we should be and what should we be doing out there.\n\n“We all want an FDA with a strong foods program. We want consumers not to worry about what they’re eating or whether they’re going to be able to get that certain needed food product,” Wagner added.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2026/01/09/new-cdc-vaccine-schedule-sc-health-officials/88070718007/", "title": "Vaccine schedule change could be 'tragic,' SC health researcher says", "text": "Updated Jan. 9, 2026, 8:53 a.m. ET\n\nAs a public health researcher, Anthony Alberg \"can't think of anything more tragic\" than an seeing preventable deaths become more common.\n\nBut that's what he thinks is likely to happen as a result of the Trump administration's revisions to recommendations regarding certain childhood vaccines.\n\n\"What this is going to lead to is a very tragic circumstance in which the incidence of preventable disease is increased as well as hospitalizations and deaths that could have been prevented,\" said Alberg, who serves as chair of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/09"}]}
