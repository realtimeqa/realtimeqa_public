Also known as Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, it is an important holiday in China, as you might have guessed. Tied to the Chinese lunar calendar, the holiday is a time for celebrating and feasting, along with honoring household and heavenly deities and ancestors. Inscribed oracle bones with astronomical records indicate that the calendar existed as early as 14th century B.C. Because the Lunar New Year depends on the moon, the date of Chinese New Year changes each year, but it will always fall between Jan. 21 and Feb. 20.\n\nWhile there are many stories, one fun legend tells the story of how the Chinese started keeping track of the passage of time by naming the years after different animals. Within the Chinese zodiac, there are 12 animals that gathered together for a race in the countryside. Each of the animals carried traits (both positive and negative) that helped them to advance in the race. The animals came through the finish line in this order: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.\n\n2022 is the Year of the Water Tiger. The tiger is known as the king of all beasts in China and is associated with bravery, confidence and strength. Also known to be strong-willed, opinionated and stubborn, the tiger years are 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022, 2034.\n\nJump on in with the tigers: Embrace the bandwagon fans hopping aboard, Bengals fan.\n\nAlong with celebrations with family and friends, Chinese New Year includes traditions, superstitions and food. For cultural custom, businesses will close for the day in order to focus on home and family. It’s considered important to take the day to enjoy yourself, eat well and do things you enjoy. Prior to the big day, houses and businesses are thoroughly cleaned to rid them of the previous year. It is akin to starting off with a clean slate.\n\nMany Chinese families have an altar dedicated to their ancestors. Sacrifices of food and paper “money” are offered to make the ancestors happy. Many also post printed scrolls scribed with lucky messages on front doors and entryways. Adults give out red envelopes containing money to employees and children. Sometimes, fireworks are set off throughout the holiday to mark the new year, but they are also to ward off bad spirits. In many provinces in China and select Chinatowns in the United States, celebrations last for the entire month.\n\nOn the eve of the new year, families gather for an extravagant meal that includes jiaozi, also known as dumplings. They are considered lucky because they resemble traditional coin purses in ancient times, representing wealth and abundance. Another menu item is nian gao, a rice cake that is sticky and compact, made of glutinous rice flour and can be either sweet or savory.\n\nNoodles, believed to represent long life, are also another staple for the dinner table. Typically prepared sauteed with vegetables, meat and seafood and sometimes broth, they are referred to as “longevity noodles.\" The simple most important item to serve is a whole fish as the Chinese believe that it signifies prosperity for the upcoming year. In the Mandarin dialect, the word for fish loosely translates to “surplus” or “extra leftover.\"\n\n10 Chinese New Year superstitions\n\nWhether you believe it or not, here are some superstitions to ponder.\n\nDon't sweep or take out garbage. The idea here is that if you do this on New Year’s Day, you’ll be sweeping wealth away or taking good fortune out of the house by taking out the garbage. Use your words wisely. Refrain from swear words or arguing. Speak of prosperity and good luck so that more of that will be welcome in the upcoming year. Avoid washing hair and getting a haircut. It is seen as “washing one’s fortune away” at the beginning of the year. Get a new haircut or get a new hairstyle before Chinese New Year for a new look and start in the upcoming year. Along with no hair washing, don't wash clothes. According to Chinese lore, to wash clothes is regarded as disrespect to the god of water. Wait three days after the new year to do your laundry. Avoid using scissors or knives as they are sharp and believed to “cut ties” with friends and family. When giving red envelopes containing money to children, make sure the amount is even. Chinese believe even numbers are lucky. The only exception to this rule is unlucky numbers such as 4 and 40 because the number 4 sounds like the word “death” in Chinese. Wear red because it’s vibrant and the same color as the envelopes that contain money. Avoid wearing white as it represents mourning or death. Chinese believe wearing new clothes and shoes will symbolize wealth and abundance in the upcoming year. Consequently, if purchasing a new outfit is not within your budget, avoid wearing damaged clothes as they symbolize \"rags.\" Avoid lending and borrowing money. Avoid visiting hospitals.\n\nWhile some of these superstitions sound unavoidable or “out there,” they’re based on old rites that have been passed through the ages, so proceed with a grain of salt and enjoy the new year.\n\nChinese horoscopes\n\nWhile growing up, the fun part was reading about the various traits of each animal associated with our birth year. The zodiac animal is oftentimes used to assess the future of a child born during that year. Similar to Western astrology, horoscopes also exist for the Chinese zodiac.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/01/29/taylor-swift-reputation-year-of-the-snake/77697031007/", "title": "Will Taylor Swift announce 'Reputation' during the year of the snake?", "text": "Updated Jan. 29, 2025, 10:52 a.m. ET\n\nThe Lunar New Year is underway and Taylor Swift fans are hoping the year of the snake yields an announcement of \"Reputation (Taylor's Version),\" an era and album symbolized by the slithering reptile.\n\nSwift is meticulous with her timing and announcement clues. In November 2021, she released \"Red (Taylor's Version)\" a month before 2022 because of her song \"22.\" She released \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\" and \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" the same year a Capital One commercial had those two eras interacting.\n\nSo if an album announcement was to come in 2025, the legions of fans posting theories to TikTok and Instagram would not be surprised. And they're ready for it.\n\n\"Is Taylor about to claim her Reputation throne?\" @V_Swiftie asks on TikTok pointing to the singer's black outfits at Chiefs games and recent black fingernail polish.\n\nThe year of the wooden snake happens every 60 years\n\nSeparate from Swiftie predictions is a culture that's been celebrated for more than 3,500 years, according to Wake Forest University's Timothy S. Y. Lam Museum of Anthropology.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n\"Some people believe that Chinese New Year originated in the Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BC),\" the museum's website explains, \"when people held sacrificial ceremonies in honor of gods and ancestors at the beginning or the end of each year.\"\n\nThe transition happens in late January or early February. Different from the Gregorian calendar, the date varies each year and is based on the moon cycles. Every 12 years the Lunar New Year cycles through the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.\n\nAnd every 12 years, a different element is paired with an animal: earth, wood, fire, water and metal.\n\nWednesday marks the year of the wooden snake, a combination that hasn't happened in 60 years. The last occurrence was from Feb. 2, 1965 to Jan. 20, 1966.\n\n\"The beginning of the new year is a time that people reflect on what's happened in the past year and send good wishes for the next year,\" says Shenzhan Liao, the senior vice president and head of the school of Chinese studies for the China Institute in America.\n\nWhile the snake may be a venomous, malevolent and feared animal in Western civilization, in ancient Chinese culture it is a symbol of wisdom, intelligence and intuition.\n\n\"The snake hibernates during the winter and becomes active when the temperature becomes warmer so it has wisdom,\" Liao says. \"The snake is also associated with adaptation — the ability to adapt and be flexible — observing a situation and having the ability to thrive and survive. ... Snakes also have a transformative power.\"\n\nAll three tiers of symbolism could be argued as traits pertaining to Swift's sixth era. Following public criticism in 2016, Swift disappeared for more than a year before returning to the limelight with her 15-track album. Kim Kardashian called Swift a snake on social media and the singer turned it into — at the time — a record breaking tour complete with a gigantic king cobra stage prop.\n\nWhen asked if the year of the snake could be the vehicle for a \"Getaway Car\" album, Liao says the meaning behind the Lunar New Year is bringing people together.\n\n\"It really is about celebrating with your friends and family. I also feel music has that power to connect, too.\" she says.\n\nThe China Institute plans to observe the Lunar New Year with a cultural extravaganza on Feb. 2 from 2-5 p.m. in New York City. The event will feature musical performances, interactive workshops and a spectacular lion dance.\n\nLiao says the excitement around a possible announcement is also a time for Swifties to learn about a new culture. To honor the Lunar New Year, she offers the phrase: \"恭喜发财,\" pronounced as \"gong shi fa tsai.\" The saying means, \"I wish you happiness and wealth.\"\n\nThe year of the snake: How is the Lunar New Year celebrated?\n\nBringing 'great fortune'\n\n\"Some say the snake brings great fortune,\" says Kelly Ma, the curator of learning and outreach at the Asia Society Museum in New York. \" There are a lot of very nice myths around snakes.\"\n\nMa explains a famous passage of Chinese culture, from \"Classics of Mountains and Seas,\" of the mythological fight that happens between the water god, Gonggong, and the fire god, Zhurong. During the battle, a mountain that holds up one corner of the sky is knocked down, splitting the sky. Through the cracks, a heavenly river floods Earth. The god Nüwa patches the cracks and saves the planet. Nüwa is portrayed as a supernatural creature with a human face and long serpentine body.\n\n\"Nüwa wanted to have friends, so she made her own friends, and those were humans,\" Ma says of the half-snake, half-human god, \"and she became a protector of humans as well.\"\n\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\n\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/29"}]}

The birds have become a problem for restaurants and other businesses, as well as a noise nuisance for the residential areas.\n\nWhen it comes to eating outdoors, “I’ll go inside unless I’m under an umbrella,” resident Frank Hampton told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. “Thing is, they’re not here during the day, it’s just at night.

He learned other towns with bird problems were using the same technique, since it is deemed safe by the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nThe program will start at the end of the month. City staff and residents will be armed with the lasers in hopes of success.\n\n“If the green lasers don’t work by themselves, then we start looking at the sound of crows in distress or other opportunities that present themselves, but this is the first step in trying to deal with the birds,” Klein said.\n\nHowever, not everyone is a fan of trying the technique.

That’s what you work so hard for … That’s why you play,” Rooney reminisces.\n\n“Actually, the best one was the first Premier League trophy we won,” he reveals, referring to Manchester United’s title success in the 2006/2007 season.\n\n“I was actually sat at home… and if Chelsea didn’t win, we won the league. I had my clothes ironed ready to go out, but I didn’t want to jinx anything. Anyway, Chelsea didn’t win so I just remember the phone going off and we had a great night.”\n\nThe mercurial talent made his Premier League debut for his home club Everton in 2002 at the age of 16.

Along the way, he won five league titles and played in three Champions League finals.\n\nYou might think that after such a grueling career, that a much-needed break was on the cards for Rooney. But at the age of 37, he has instead turned his attention to coaching.\n\nHe relocated to Washington in July, to manage D.C. United, a team he spent some time playing with. It won’t be an easy task considering the franchise finished bottom of the MLS Eastern Conference, but that doesn’t seem to bother Rooney.\n\nD.C.

Trying to develop players, young players, but also having that relationship with the more senior players, and trying to develop them.”\n\n“The appealing thing, obviously going back to D.C. and going in as head coach for me was if you look at all the big teams and the culture, it’s so diverse with different nationalities, different religions.”\n\nWhile Rooney is happy stateside for now, it’s clear his long-term ambitions lie closer to home.\n\n“Obviously Everton and Manchester United are the two clubs who are really close to my heart so to manage one of them two would be a dream,” he admits, the latter currently coached by his former England teammate, Frank Lampard.\n\n“I’m still gaining a lot of experience from what I’m doing. You want to learn, and I want to go into Everton or Manchester United, I want to go in there and be able to give the best version of me.\n\n“I’d be naive to say, ‘I’m going to go and manage Manchester United in the next year or so.’ For me it’s about putting the work in and developing myself and if I do that and I do it in the right way, then I feel these jobs, these opportunities will come to me eventually.”\n\nRooney’s tenure at DC United comes after a tumultuous reign at English side Derby County.\n\nThe club went into administration after debts spiraled and it failed to play players their wages. Deducted points for financial mismanagement, Derby was eventually relegated, but Rooney was praised for his efforts to keep them in the Championship, English football’s second tier.\n\nWayne Rooney gives his team instructions during a Derby County game. Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\n“I’m proud of what we achieved there … we were relegated but without the deductions we would’ve stayed in the division.\n\n“There was so many difficulties in what we were facing and obstacles for us to try and get over,” Rooney laments.\n\n“I give them [sic] players so much praise because I think it was 21 debuts from the academy … There are players who maybe didn’t even have a career in football who now have [one].”\n\nLearning from the best\n\nIf he’s looking for advice, Rooney has no shortage of mentors to draw from.\n\nDavid Moyes, now West Ham manager, handed him his debut as a 16-year-old in 2002, La Liga winner Fabio Capello coached him for a spell at England, and Rooney finished his United career under two-time Champions League champion José Mourinho.\n\nBut he says his biggest influence was the Manchester club’s most successful coach, Alex Ferguson, who signed him for the club for a then-record sum for a teenager of nearly $50 million.\n\n“He was great to play for, he’s the reason I signed for Manchester United to play for him. The best advice I got … was from Alex Ferguson, [and it] was [that] the hardest thing to do in life is to work hard every day. And that’s the best. That’s always stuck with me.\n\nThen Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson congratulates Wayne Rooney after his final Premier League title win in 2013. Alex Livesey/Getty Images\n\n“From a football point of view, coaching point of view, of course you’re going to make mistakes, you’re going to get things wrong, but there’s no excuse really to not work.”\n\nManchester United has seen scant success since Ferguson retired in 2013. The 20-time English league winner has seen derby rivals Manchester City outpace them on and off the field since the takeover of the club by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008.\n\nErik ten Hag took over the coaching reins in the summer and the Dutchman has notched a few impressive wins which have lifted the mood around Old Trafford. While Rooney was in Dubai, goals from Fred and Bruno Fernandes gave the Manchester club a dominant victory over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n“It’s the best I’ve seen Manchester United for a long time,” says Rooney. “I think you can see what he’s trying to do. High energy, high press with the team and it was very difficult for Tottenham to play against.”\n\nThe only black mark on that performance was star player Cristiano Ronaldo walking down the tunnel with several minutes left to play because he didn’t get on the pitch. Ten Haag later suspended the player, but Ronaldo’s clear desire to play, is a positive sign for a coach, according to Rooney.\n\n“Football’s emotional and you want players who want to be on the pitch. I don’t mind a player coming off and not being happy. I’ve done it myself,” says Rooney, who played with Ronaldo during his most successful period at United.\n\nIf Rooney has any regrets from his playing career, it’s his performance for England at international tournaments.\n\nAt the age of 18, Rooney became the youngest scorer in European Championship history – a record that only stood for four days after the Englishman’s landmark was taken by Switzerland’s Johan Vonlanthen at Euro 2004.\n\nRooney celebrates scoring a goal at Wembley in 2015, breaking the record for most international goals for England. Shaun Botterill/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhen he set the record, Rooney grabbed two goals in England’s second group game, a 3-0 defeat of Switzerland. He then broke a bone in his foot in the quarterfinal defeat by Portugal when England lost on penalties.\n\nTwo years later Rooney was infamously sent off at against Portugal at the 2006 World Cup for lashing out at then club teammate Ronaldo.\n\nDespite playing as part of a team containing English icons such as Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, known as the “Golden Generation,” Rooney never won a trophy with the national side.\n\n“We were unlucky a few times,” Rooney laments. “Obviously in the Euros, 2004, 2006 World Cup, getting knocked out on penalties, both at the quarterfinal stage. And, again, that’s that little bit of luck you need, if you go through there, you potentially go on to win the competition.”", "authors": ["Eoin Mcsweeney Becky Anderson", "Eoin Mcsweeney", "Becky Anderson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}]}

Why it's unlikely.", "text": "Updated Feb. 20, 2026, 4:01 p.m. ET\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, Duke of York, was arrested on Thursday, Feb. 19, his 66th birthday, for suspicion of misconduct in public life. Hours later, he was released from police custody.\n\nThe former prince allegedly leaked confidential information to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to previous USA TODAY reporting. Mountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nKing Charles III is the older brother of Mountbatten-Windsor and in response to the arrest, issued a statement via Buckingham Palace signaling support for a \"full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\"\n\n\"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,\" the king added. \"As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.\"\n\nStill, some might wonder if the king could pardon his brother, former Prince Andrew. The short answer: it's very unlikely. Here's what to know.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nLive updates: Former Prince Andrew seen in first photo since release after arrest\n\nWho is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor? Ex-prince tied to Epstein scandal\n\nCan King Charles pardon ex-Prince Andrew?\n\nKing Charles holds the \"royal prerogative of mercy,\" a power granted to the ruling British monarch that allows them to issue pardons for persons convicted of criminal offenses, according to the UK government.\n\nIf Mountbatten-Windsor is convicted of a crime, it's technically not impossible for him to receive a pardon from his brother, King Charles. However, issuing clemency would require approval from governing bodies.\n\nThe king has no direct power to ask for a pardon, Robert Hazell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, said in emailed comments to USA TODAY.\n\n\"King Charles has no discretion independently to exercise the prerogative of mercy: He can only do so on the advice of the government,\" said Hazell.\n\nExpert: An Andrew pardon could cause 'riot in the streets'\n\nAnother reason a pardon is unlikely is because the British public would likely not approve and the king could face backlash.\n\nWhen the then-prince was stripped of his royal titles in 2025 over his ties with Epstein, it came with the overwhelming support from Brits. He'd previously been removed as a senior royal in 2022.\n\nAccording to a 2025 Ipsos poll, 88% of Britons thought it was definitely or probably the right decision. Additionally, eight in 10 Britons had an unfavorable opinion of the prince at that time.\n\n\"I don't think (Charles) is going to give him a pardon,\" Andrew Lownie, author of 'Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York,' told USA TODAY.\n\n\"I think there would be a sort of riot in the streets if that happened, and that really would kill the monarchy.\"\n\nCases of previous royal pardons\n\nRoyal pardons are rarely used and typically only issued when a person is innocent of the offense and when a request has been made by someone with a vested interest, such as a family member, according to the United Kingdom's government website. Pardons can be issued without either requirement being met, as was the case with Alan Turing.\n\nTuring, considered the father of computer science, was given a posthumous royal pardon by the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2013. He was convicted in 1952 for \"gross indecency\" after being arrested following an affair with a 19-year-old man, which is no longer a crime in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter his conviction, Turing was chemically castrated.\n\nThe most recent high-profile recipient of a royal pardon was Steve Gallant, 47. The convicted murderer was on a day release from prison to attend a conference for rehabilitated prisoners when he confronted a terrorist attacker with a narwhal tusk on London Bridge. Two people died in the tragedy. Gallant's sentence began in 2005. He was released from prison in 2021. The queen reduced his sentence by 10 months.\n\nAllegations against Prince Andrew, Epstein ties\n\nSince last autumn, Mountbatten-Windsor has appeared in several pages and images released by the U.S. government in relation to Epstein. The latest cache of documents included a photo of the former prince kneeling on all fours over an unidentified woman lying on the ground.\n\nThe former prince came under intense scrutiny over his ties with the disgraced financier following a BBC interview in 2019. In the interview, he said he met Epstein in 1991 through his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, but denied ever coming into contact with the late Virginia Giuffre.\n\nOne of the Epstein victims, Giuffre, said she was 17 years old when she was allegedly trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sexual relations with the then-prince. The encounters took place between 2001 and 2002, she said.\n\nThe former prince gave the remarks despite the existence of a photograph with him and Giuffre in Maxwell's London home in 2001.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor raised issues with the photograph's authenticity, saying it might not be him in the picture because he was wearing his \"traveling clothes\" and suggested his left hand may have been photoshopped onto Giuffre's waist.\n\nGiuffre filed a sex abuse lawsuit against Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021. The former prince settled the suit the following year but continued to deny the allegations against him.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, Wendy Naugle\n\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

The UK's king later confirmed the news.\n\nThe former prince has faced intense scrutiny over his friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor, 66, has denied any wrongdoing and said he regrets the friendship. He has not responded to requests for comment following the latest Epstein files published by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThe UK's Thames Valley Police said in a statement that they arrested a man in his sixties and were carrying out searches at addresses in Norfolk and Berkshire. The statement did not name the suspect. Police said an investigation was opened. Mountbatten-Windsor recently moved to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.\n\nNeed a news break?

Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his royal titles last year over his links to Epstein.\n\nThe specific police allegations under investigation have not been released. It is not connected to alleged sex offenses. Previous reporting by the BBC and others have alleged that Mountbatten-Windsor may have shared confidential governments reports connected to investments in Afghanistan and His Majesty's Treasury department. It is not immediately clear if that information was shared directly with Epstein or other business associates.\n\nIn one photo that appeared in the files released by the Justice Dept. in relation to the U.S. investigation of Epstein, the former prince can be seen kneeling on all fours over an unidentified woman on the ground.\n\n'Be nice and behave.' How Epstein used web of power figures to his benefit\n\nKing Charles weighs in on brother's arrest\n\nHis arrest coincided with the former prince's 66th birthday.\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers and the family of his most prominent accuser, Virginia Giuffre, who alleged in her posthumous memoir that she was a victim of Epstein's sex-trafficking ring, have appealed to Mountbatten-Windsor to testify in the U.S. about his Epstein connections. The former prince reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022. Mountbatten-Windsor denied any wrongdoing in the case and he did not admit any liability.\n\nBritish police have also opened an investigation into the UK's former ambassador to the U.S, Peter Mandelson, over his Epstein connections. Mandelson, too, is being investigated on allegations of misconduct in public office. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into whether he passed on market-sensitive government information to Epstein when Mandelson was business secretary in Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government, in 2008.\n\nO’Bryan Grandison, a professor of policing at the UK's Birmingham City University, said in emailed comments that Mountbatten-Windsor is the first senior royal to be arrested in modern history.\n\nKing Charles has previously said the royal family is \"ready to support\" police in their investigations.\n\n\"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,\" the UK king said in a new statement.\n\n\"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.

Can we have that king?", "text": "Feb. 20, 2026, 4:31 a.m. ET\n\nAs a humble American citizen, I watched with envy as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, stemming from his past links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the former prince is the “first senior royal in modern history to be arrested.” Huzzah! It’s good to see somebody taking the despicable Epstein files seriously.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor’s brother, King Charles III, released a statement saying, “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.”\n\nImagine that? Here in America, our present king-ish figure, President Donald Trump, is telling Americans to move on from the Epstein files, perhaps because his name appears in them so many times and he had a well-documented friendship with the late financier, who was accused of operating a sprawling and heinous sex-trafficking operation involving myriad wealthy elites.\n\nThere are Epstein consequences overseas. Over here? Not so much.\n\nAsked about the former prince’s arrest Feb. 19, Trump told reporters, falsely: “I'm the expert in a way because I've been totally exonerated. That's very nice. I can actually speak about it very nicely. I think it's a shame.”\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nFirst, I don’t think declaring yourself an “expert” on all things Epstein is quite the flex King Trump thinks it is. Second, he has in no way been exonerated, and has been frustrating even members of his own party by slow-walking the release of and over-redacting the Epstein files he promised to expose.\n\nIn England, aside from Mountbatten-Windsor, Peter Mandelson lost his post as British ambassador to the United States and is facing a criminal investigation relating to the Epstein files. The scandal led to the resignation of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, not because McSweeney is in the files – he's not – but because he advised Starmer to appoint Mandelson as ambassador.\n\nAnd Starmer himself is facing political turmoil over the whole mess.\n\nThe British are showing Americans what Epstein accountability looks like\n\nAs Forbes noted Feb. 19: “The political firestorm over the Epstein files in the U.K. stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where President Donald Trump has downplayed his own ties to Epstein and there have been no major consequences for other members of his administration named in the files, like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick,” who has also denied any wrongdoing.\n\nRob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, explained to The Associated Press why things are different in Britain, saying, “It suggests to me we have a more functional media, we have a more functional accountability structure, that there is still a degree of shame in politics, in terms of people will say: ‘This is just not acceptable, this is just not done.' ”\n\nWell, that’s embarrassing.\n\nMaybe we need to reconsider that 'No Kings' line ...\n\nI have to be honest, the British royal family is handling the Epstein revelations a lot better than the \"American Royal Family\" wannabes.\n\nWe’re having “No Kings” protests here while the country across the pond with an actual king is making us look bad. Folks might want to amend their protest signs to read something like, “No Kings, Though If We Had To Choose, It Would Be The British One.”\n\nCome to think of it …\n\nIn the wake of Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, and given my respect for the United Kingdom’s serious investigation into the Epstein files, I hereby revoke America's independence and demand a return to the control of the more reasonable and just British monarchy.\n\nSimply put, if I have to deal with a king, at this point in history, I’d rather King Charles III than King Trump the Turd.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/19/uk-trade-leak-epstein-prince-andrew-arrest/88765259007/", "title": "Alleged UK trade info leaks to Epstein led to former Prince Andrew's ...", "text": "Feb. 19, 2026 Updated Feb. 20, 2026, 11:06 a.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – It wasn't Jeffrey Epstein's illicit past that led to the stunning arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on Feb. 19. It was the alleged leak of confidential information from the former prince to the convicted sex offender.\n\nThe charges of misconduct in office reportedly being pursued by British authorities could put former Prince Andrew in significant legal jeopardy. The charges relate to leaks of information while Andrew acted as the United Kingdom's trade envoy.\n\nThe first known modern arrest of a senior British royal raises questions about the handling of sensitive UK government information, the oversight of quasi-official royal roles and Andrew’s long relationship with Epstein.\n\nBritish media outlets say Andrew’s arrest – on his 66th birthday – stems from his time as Britain's special representative for international trade and investment from 2001 to 2011.\n\nEpstein, who was accused of overseeing a global sex-trafficking network, died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial. (He had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.) His closest associate Ghislaine Maxwell – daughter of British publisher Robert Maxwell and frequent companion of Mountbatten-Windsor – was convicted of similar charges and is serving a 20-year sentence in a U.S. federal prison.\n\nThe former prince has strenuously denied any wrongdoing on all fronts, especially related to the longstanding allegations that he was consorting with young women and even underage girls provided by Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nThe Thames Valley Police department, the agency that arrested Andrew, said it would have no comment on the ongoing investigation, including what charges Andrew might be facing, only that they arrested “a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office.”\n\nAndrew has been living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, England. Any potential case against him on official misconduct does not change his potential legal liability for sex-related crimes.\n\nAndrew was released from custody later Feb. 19 and remained “under investigation,” said the Thames Valley Police, which arrested Andrew where he was staying on King Charles' private Sandringham estate.\n\nAn international trade and investment envoy\n\nAndrew’s arrest follows the recent release of millions of Epstein-related documents by the U.S. Justice Department, including previously undisclosed communications between Andrew, Epstein and others.\n\nThose documents show that Andrew allegedly leaked sensitive information about the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Aston Martin, the luxury sports car manufacturer, as well as government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein, the BBC reported, citing the recently published files.\n\nAnother email, on Christmas Eve 2010, appeared to send Epstein a confidential brief on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand province, Afghanistan.\n\nThe email reads: “Attached is a confidential brief produced by the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand Province for International Investment Opportunities. These are not exclusive to Helmand Province but principally focused on that province. I am going to offer this elsewhere in my network (including Abu Dhabi) but would be very interested in your comments, views or ideas as to whom I could also usefully show this to attract some interest. I have sadly already found out that Gates Foundation doesn't do anything in Afghanistan.”\n\nThe email is signed, “HRH The Duke of York KG”\n\n'Air Miles Andy' traveling the world on the UK taxpayer dime\n\nIn his role as a UK trade envoy, Andrew – then the Duke of York – traveled globally, and enjoyed what the BBC said was “privileged access to senior government and business contacts around the world.”\n\nHis frequent travel, funded by UK taxpayers, earned him the title “Air Miles Andy” by the British media.\n\nSuch UK trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits, the BBC said, citing official guidance.\n\nThat prompted a fresh review by British authorities and public calls for an aggressive investigation by UK authorities.\n\nBefore his arrest, Thames Valley Police had spoken with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service, the principal public agency for conducting criminal prosecutions in England and Wales, about allegations that Mountbatten-Windsor had shared confidential reports from his role as the UK's trade envoy with Epstein and potentially others, according to the BBC and other UK media.\n\nAndrew, the younger brother to King Charles, had stepped back from his senior royal roles in 2019. He was stripped of his military and charitable associations in January 2022. And in an Oct. 30, 2025 statement, Buckingham Palace said he would be stripped of his royal style, titles and honors. He is no longer a prince and is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nA 'government investigation into how this was allowed to happen'\n\nIt does not appear from what has been disclosed in the latest Justice Department release of Epstein files that Andrew provided any classified information that could jeopardize British – or U.S. – national security.\n\nStill, Andrew’s alleged leaking of such information, especially to someone suspected of running an ongoing criminal enterprise at the time, has become a politically explosive issue in the UK.\n\nIf Andrew did indeed leak such information, it’s \"totally unacceptable,\" Sir Vince Cable told the BBC on Feb. 15 in calling for a criminal investigation.\n\n\"We need a police or DPP [director of public prosecutions] check on whether criminal corruption took place and a government investigation into how this was allowed to happen,” said Cable, the secretary of state for business and trade for some of Andrew’s time as trade envoy.\n\nU.S. legal experts also said Andrew faces potentially serious legal jeopardy.\n\n“Sharing confidential government information outside official channels is a serious national security risk,” said Jake Braun, a former senior White House and Department of Homeland Security official under President Barack Obama. “Insider threats — the misuse of authorized access — remain one of the most significant vulnerabilities governments face.”\n\n“Trade negotiations and diplomatic strategy involve sensitive economic intelligence that can shape markets, alliances, and geopolitical leverage,” said Braun, who is now the executive director of the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy Cyber Policy Initiative. “When a senior official entrusted with that information discloses it improperly, it undermines trust, weakens negotiating power, and creates potential openings for exploitation.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/19/former-prince-andrew-photos-emails-epstein-files/88755270007/", "title": "Where does former Prince Andrew appear in the Epstein files?", "text": "Feb. 19, 2026 Updated Feb. 20, 2026, 8:47 a.m. ET\n\nAmong the many mentions of the former Prince Andrew, now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, in the Epstein files, a few jump to the top of the pile. They include photos of King Charles III's younger brother with young women whose faces have been redacted by federal prosecutors, emails demonstrating his lengthy friendship with the disgraced financier and concerns from law enforcement that he wasn't cooperating with ongoing investigations.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor, 66, as he's known since he was stripped of his titles and most of his royal duties last fall, has faced intense scrutiny over his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He has denied any wrongdoing and said he regrets the friendship.\n\nThe more than 3 million pages of documents released by the Justice Department, in the wake of a nearly unanimous transparency mandate by Congress, show the former prince maintained regular contact with the wealth manager for more than two years after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to sex crimes. The DOJ has acknowledged that it has another 3 million pages of documents that it does not intend to make public.\n\nBritish police arrested the former prince on Feb. 19 on suspicion of misconduct in public life, according to multiple news outlets in the United Kingdom. British police said earlier this month that officers were considering allegations that the king's brother passed confidential government documents to Epstein.\n\nWhat images of former Prince Andrew appear in the Epstein files?\n\nIn photos released by the DOJ on Jan. 30, Mountbatten-Windsor is bending over and touching the waist and stomach of a fully clothed woman lying on her back on the floor. In a second photograph, he is on his hands and knees, crouching over the woman, whose face has been redacted.\n\nAmong a previous batch of files produced by the Justice Department on Dec. 19 is one of the former royal with Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. The image shows a suited Mountbatten-Windsor lying on his side across the laps of five women, whose faces have been obscured by DOJ staffers. Maxwell stands behind them, smiling down.\n\nLike other items in the document release, the DOJ did not provide context for the photos, including when and where they were taken.\n\nThe 'Invisible Man' seeking 'new inappropriate friends'\n\nAmong the thousands of pages of documents released on Dec. 23, 2025, is a 2001 email exchange from a person using the alias \"The Invisible Man,\" who signs off as \"A\" while writing to Epstein associate Maxwell that \"I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family.\"\n\nBalmoral was the beloved summer residence of Queen Elizabeth II in Scotland, and a gathering place for the royal family retreats.\n\n\"How's LA?\" the email reads. \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends? Let me know when you are coming over as I am free from 25th August until 2nd Sept. and want to go somewhere hot and sunny with some fun people before having to put my nose firmly to the grindstone for the Fall. Any ideas gratefully received!\"\n\n\"See ya A xxx,\" the email concludes. The files did not confirm whether \"The Invisible Man\" was Mountbatten-Windsor. Other emails forwarded to \"The Invisible Man\" refer to him as \"Andrew.\"\n\nAnother 2002 email shows \"Gx,\" which is how Maxwell often signed emails in the files, writing to another person that \"I just gave Andrew your\" phone number and asking this person to set him up on a trip to Peru. \"Gx\" says to expect a call from a \"very English sounding gentleman\" and asks the person to \"show him a wonderful time\" and \"only introduce him to friends that you can trust and rely on to be friendly and discreet and fun.\" This email was forwarded by \"Gx\" to \"The Invisible Man,\" who replied, \"Got it I will ring him today if I can.\"\n\nLaw enforcement communication\n\nA document dated April 2020 in the Dec. 23, 2025 release shows that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI sought to interview Mountbatten-Windsor because an ongoing Epstein investigation \"revealed that Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation.\"\n\nThe document notes, though, that he \"is not presently a target of the investigation, and U.S. authorities have not, to date, gathered evidence that he has committed any crime under U.S. law.\"\n\nAnother series of emails shows U.S. diplomatic and law enforcement officials were troubled in August 2021 when Mountbatten-Windsor continued to refuse to cooperate with their criminal investigation of Maxwell. British authorities wanted to know if he had become a suspect as opposed to a witness.\n\nIn a series of Aug. 24, 2021 emails, also released on Jan. 30, officials in the U.S. embassy in London discussed with counterparts in Washington how to respond to British government inquiries. Mountbatten-Windsor had been publicly accused in a civil lawsuit of consorting with at least one girl who alleges she had been trafficked by Epstein.\n\nAt the time of the 2021 embassy emails, Maxwell had been charged with sex trafficking, and Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre had just filed a civil lawsuit against Mountbatten-Windsor. Her civil case was settled in February 2022 for an undisclosed amount, with the then-prince making a substantial donation to her charity.\n\n“We are aware that a civil case has been filed in New York concerning the Epstein investigation with the material witness as the defendant,” someone from the UK government said in an inquiry to the U.S. embassy, shared by the embassy official. “Please can you let us know what impact this has on the material witness's current status, as a witness, in the criminal investigation and in relation to the MLA request.”\n\n“I think they are asking whether, in light of the recent allegations, that Andrew 'is now a suspect instead of a witness (in British parlance)',” said the unidentified U.S. embassy official, apparently the Justice Department attache in London. “I was going to respond with one word ‘none’ but thought I should check first. … The earlier the better because the Amb is keen to sort this out.”\n\n\"The Amb\" refers to the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom at the time. An MLA is a request under the U.S.-UK Mutual Legal Assistance treaty to gather evidence, exchange information and serve documents in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution.\n\nContributing: Brendan Morrow, Josh Meyer, Taijuan Moorman and Anthony Robledo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/us/uvalde-911-classroom-call-delay", "title": "First on CNN: 10-year-old trapped with the Uvalde school shooter ...", "text": "CNN —\n\n“I’m in classroom 112,” the little girl tells the police dispatcher. “Please hurry. There is a lot of dead bodies.”\n\nThe clear plea comes in a 12:10 p.m. call from Khloie Torres, then 10 years old and trapped at Robb Elementary School with a gunman who has slaughtered her friends and a teacher. Khloie, now 11, survived.\n\nKhloie Torres, photographed by her mom, did all she could to keep her friends calm and get help. Courtesy Jamie Torres\n\n“Please get help. I don’t wanna die. My teacher is dead. Oh, my God.”\n\nThe dispatcher sends out the message to the dozens, soon to be hundreds of law enforcement officers swarming to the school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nIt’s more than 30 minutes since the teenager entered the school and shot his way into classrooms 111 and 112.\n\nAnd it takes 40 more minutes from Khloie giving details to authorities until a strike team burst into the room, challenging the gunman at 12:50 p.m.\n\nCNN has heard this 911 call, and others made by the same girl and classmates, whispering information and pleading for help. It’s the call that should have ended any doubt or hesitation that the teenage gunman was active, roaming between the two connected classrooms, that children were trapped, injured and needed to be saved.\n\nThe entire law enforcement response has been condemned, almost from start to finish. And agencies have blamed each other in changing narratives since the massacre on May 24, for not following up on the initial attempt to go into the classroom when the gunman fired back, to treating the suspect as barricaded but not an active threat, and long waits for equipment and specialist personnel.\n\nNineteen children and two teachers were killed that day, though at least one adult and one child did not die immediately. Texas’ top cop, director of the Department of Public Safety Col. Steven McCraw, has acknowledged failures, most recently to bereaved families last week, but insisted his department as a whole did not fail the community.\n\nCNN obtained the calls from a source and is using excerpts with the approval of Khloie’s parents. CNN also informed families who lost people in the massacre that this story was coming.\n\nKhloie’s father, Ruben Torres, a former Marine, said he knew how hard it was to give good information when under fire. “That day, the things that she did were absolutely incredible,” he said of his daughter. Of the adults who responded, he said: “None of them had courage that day.”\n\nHer mother, Jamie Torres, said it hurt to know Khloie called and still waited that long for help. “All the kids didn’t have backup in there. Nobody had armor in there,” she told “CNN This Morning” on Wednesday. “They went through a lot, and they had absolutely no help from police.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Girl calls 911 during Uvalde shooting.

Have y’all captured the person?” the fourth grader asks at 12:12 p.m. And a few minutes later, “You want me to open the door now?”\n\nTime and again Khloie is told by the dispatcher to stay quiet, to keep her terrified and injured friends quiet, and to wait.\n\n“I’m telling everyone to be quiet but nobody is listening to me,” she tells the operator. “I understand what to do in these situations. My dad taught me when I was a little girl. Send help.”\n\nShe tells the 911 operator that her teacher – Eva Mireles – is alive but has been shot and asks for an ambulance at 12:15 p.m.\n\nOutside, a final total of 376 armed law enforcement personnel are gathering.\n\nAt 12:12 p.m. the radio call goes out: “Uvalde to any units: Be advised we do have a child on the line … room 12 [sic]. Is anybody inside of the building at this time?”\n\n“Go ahead with that child’s information,” an answer comes back.\n\n“The child is advising he [sic] is in in the room full of victims, full of victims at this moment.”\n\n“10-4,” comes the confirmation.\n\nThe announcement can clearly be heard on audio captured by body cameras worn by officers inside the school.\n\nThere was plenty of confusion at the start of the massive response to the school shooting, which came after the gunman shot his grandmother in the head and crashed a truck near the school, both of which triggered emergency calls.\n\nOnce in the school, it wasn’t immediately known whether the shooter went to an office or a classroom, or whether he had victims with him.\n\nBut the call from Khloie and some of her classmates who came on the line or made their own attempts to call for help were clear. And known.\n\nThe news spreads beyond those who heard the initial transmission.\n\n“Supposedly one kid called as it was underway. He’s been in that room for an hour now,” an officer tells a newly arrived responder, apparently referring to the shooter.\n\n“We don’t know if he has anybody in the room with him, do we?” asks an officer in the hallway outside the classrooms. “He does,” comes the reply. “Eight or nine children.”\n\nEMT: ‘We’re taking too long’\n\nWhile some are talking about gas masks and shields and a command post, an emergency medic from Border Patrol arrives. He, too, knows about the children.\n\n“EMT! EMT!” he shouts as he asks how to get to the victims in “Room 12.” One officer shrugs. Another who’s been on the scene for more than 20 minutes says, “No, we hadn’t heard that,” apparently referring to injured children.\n\nThe medic tells them: “They just had a kid in room 12, multiple victims, room 12.” He goes inside the hallway to where more officers are huddling. “They said kids, room 12.”\n\nThere’s talk of finding a master key.\n\nThen more gunshots.\n\nOfficers with long guns, helmets and body armor move a little closer, and stop.\n\n“F**k. We’re taking too long,” the medic says.\n\nInside the classroom, Khloie starts her third call to 911.\n\n“Can you tell the police to come to my room?” she asks. And again, minutes later, “Can you send a policeman in now, please?”\n\nShe is told to stay quiet, to keep her classmates – some apparently moaning in pain – quiet, and wait.\n\nShe said to the dispatcher she thought she heard police in the hallway and was again advised to stay quiet.\n\nLater, Khloie tells police how she was using her teacher’s phone, how she knew how to make the emergency call without having to unlock the phone as it was like her dad’s.\n\nShe also told of how she had time to try to help her friends while the gunman was in the adjoining classroom, where he killed all the students and wounded the teacher.\n\n“I stood up to look for Band-Aids ‘cause my friend had a big cut.”\n\nThen, fearing the shooter might come back to her room, she hid again, under a table.\n\nThe girl is on the call as officers finally force their way in to the room next door. Loud, prolonged bursts of gunfire can be heard as the dispatcher tells her: “Stay down. Do not get up. Stay down. Do not, do not move.”\n\nThe girl survives. She is taken to the hospital on a school bus with other injured classmates where she’s able to speak face to face with one of the responders, saying she was on the phone.\n\n“I was trying not to cry,” she said.", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Matthew J.

Supporters of the Phoenix Mercury player have called for her release over fears she is being used as a political pawn amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGriner’s lawyers expect the court to take into account the 31-year-old athlete’s guilty plea and hope for leniency, Alexander Boykov and Maria Blagovolina told journalists Thursday.\n\nSamples taken from Griner did not show any traces of drugs, Boykov added. “She was clean, and she was tested,” the lawyer said.\n\nIt was her decision to plead guilty, Griner’s Russian legal team said in a statement, adding that she “sets an example of being brave.”\n\n“She decided to take full responsibility for her actions as she knows that she is a role model for many people,” their statement read.\n\n“Considering the nature of her case, the insignificant amount of the substance and BG’s personality and history of positive contributions to global and Russian sport, the defense hopes that the plea will be considered by the court as a mitigating factor and there will be no severe sentence.”\n\nHer lawyers said they expect the trial to end around the beginning of the August.\n\nGriner left the courtroom Thursday without giving any comment to reporters. Her next hearing is set for July 14.\n\nGriner was arrested in February at a Moscow airport after Russian officials say they found cannabis oil in her luggage. The basketball star, who plays in Russia during the WNBA’s offseason, has been held since then on drug smuggling charges. Her trial began last week.\n\nGriner told the court Thursday she had not intended to commit a crime, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Griner had not meant to carry drugs in her luggage, she said through an interpreter, and it was the result of her packing in a hurry, the report said.\n\nThe decision to plead guilty was made by Griner alone, a source close to her said. But in recent weeks, Griner, her family, lawyers and experts had discussed this decision extensively. Given the 99% reported conviction rate in Russian criminal cases, Griner was urged to weigh all the factors, including a plea that could ultimately result in a shorter sentence.\n\nSome have speculated Griner could be released and returned to the US in a prisoner swap, as was Trevor Reed, an American veteran detained in Russia for three years before his release in April.\n\nThere is no indication such a swap is imminent in Griner’s case.\n\nStill, before any potential prisoner swap, it was expected Griner would have to be convicted and also admit fault, a senior US official told CNN. Reed had to sign a document saying he was guilty – something he had resisted for almost the entirety of his detention – just days before he was let out, the official said.\n\n“It is part of the show and the document has no legal force or effect in the US. It is effectively meaningless,” said Reed family spokesperson Jonathan Franks.\n\nGriner’s plea came on the second day of her trial, at which a prosecutor accused her of smuggling less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. Prosecutors argue Griner intended to import the drugs into Russia’s territory and put the prohibited substances into a backpack and a suitcase, according to TASS, another state news agency.\n\nGriner appreciates letter from Biden, lawyer says\n\nAt Thursday’s hearing, a senior US diplomat gave Griner a letter US President Joe Biden wrote her in reply to her July 4 letter in which she pleaded for Biden’s help. The US Embassy in Moscow shared Biden’s letter with Griner during her trial, Charge d’affaires Elizabeth Rood said Thursday.\n\nGriner appreciated Biden’s letter “like every citizen of every country would appreciate a personal letter from the President,” Boykov said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House announced Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had spoken by phone with Griner’s wife. Cherelle Griner was “grateful” for the call, she said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n“While I will remain concerned and outspoken until (Brittney Griner) is back home, I am hopeful in knowing that the President read my wife’s letter and took the time to respond,” she said. “I know BG will be able to find comfort in knowing she has not been forgotten.”\n\nMeantime, the US government should “continue doing what they are doing and exhaust every measure possible to help bring BG home,” Griner’s Mercury head coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN on Thursday following her plea.\n\nWhile the focus must be on bringing Griner home safely, Nygaard also called out a perceived double standard in the “lack of coverage and the value of women’s sports.”\n\n“The question is, would Tom Brady be home?” the coach said. “But Tom Brady wouldn’t be there, right, because he doesn’t have to go to a foreign country to supplement his income from the WNBA.”\n\nA rally Wednesday for Griner held by the Mercury and the office of US Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona was “really, really wonderful,” Nygaard said, adding she still was concerned about Griner’s safety in Russia.\n\n“In her letter (to Biden), she said that she was scared,” the coach said. “This is not just a regular American in another country, but this is a person who is represented our country well. She’s also a gay woman. She’s also a black woman in Russia. And we need to pay attention to that and help to bring her home.”", "authors": ["Anna Chernova Abphillip Dakin Andone Alaa Elassar", "Anna Chernova", "Dakin Andone", "Alaa Elassar"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/09/us/vicky-casey-white-alabama-manhunt-monday", "title": "Vicky White, Alabama corrections officer who escaped with ... - CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer Alabama corrections officer Vicky White has died from injuries after she and escaped inmate Casey White were arrested in Indiana earlier Monday, Sheriff Dave Wedding of Vanderburgh County told CNN.\n\nShe was hospitalized earlier with self-inflicted gunshot wounds after being taken into custody following a car chase in Evansville, Indiana, US Marshals previously told CNN. Her wounds were “very serious,” Wedding said at the time.\n\nNo law enforcement officers fired shots, according to Sheriff Rick Singleton of Lauderdale County, Alambama, where the pair – who are not related – fled on April 29.\n\nBefore the chase ensued, officers conducting surveillance spotted Vicky White exiting a hotel with a wig on, according to US Marshal Marty Keely. Then, she and Casey White got into a car and drove away.\n\nAuthorities continued to watch them until a vehicle pursuit began, ending when a US Marshals task force member drove a vehicle into the Cadillac the pair were in. The car wrecked and rolled over, he said. Casey White was driving the car, according to the US Marshals, though Wedding had earlier told reporters Vicky White was the driver.\n\nOfficers were able to remove the inmate from the wrecked car, but Vicky White was pinned inside with a gunshot wound to her head, Keely said.\n\nCasey White reportedly told officers to help “his wife” who had shot herself in the head, according to Keely, and told them he didn’t do it. Keely said to their knowledge Casey White and Vicky White are not married.\n\nThe scene at the end of the police chase in Evansville, Indiana.

The inmate faces previous murder charges. Vicky White, 56, was first charged with permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree and was later facing additional forgery and identity theft charges.\n\n“He will be in a cell by himself,” Singleton said. “He will stay in handcuffs and shackles while he’s in that cell and if he wants to sue me for violating his civil rights, so be it. He’s not getting out of this jail again. I’ll assure you that.”\n\nSingleton said, “I’ve always expected this outcome. I knew we would catch them. It was just a matter of time.”\n\nMost escapes from a county jail are spontaneous, he said.\n\n“This escape was obviously well planned and calculated,” Singleton said. “A lot of preparation went into this. They had plenty of resources, had cash, had vehicles, had everything they needed to pull this off, and that’s what made this last week and a half so challenging. We were starting from ground zero, and not only that, we started – they got a six-hour head start on us.”\n\nPhotos from Indiana car wash released\n\nEarlier Monday, US Marshals released photos of who they believe was Casey White caught on a surveillance camera at an Evansville car wash.\n\nIt was the first time since he escaped a Lauderdale County detention center with Vicky White that he was reported seen.\n\nVicky White was not seen in the photos.\n\nUS Marshals released photos of who they believe is fugitive Casey White at an Indiana car wash. US Marshals Service\n\nInvestigators were notified Sunday night that a 2006 Ford F-150 had been discovered at a car wash in Evansville, about 175 miles north of Williamson County, Tennessee, where the 2007 Ford Edge the pair had been traveling in was found abandoned.\n\nThe owner provided the images from a security camera, US Marshals said in a release.\n\nMarshals went to Indiana following up on the tip, the agency said.\n\nUS Marshals Service said it believes the person in the photo is Casey White. US Marshals Service\n\nA reward of up to $15,000 was offered for information leading to his capture, and $10,000 for information leading to Vicky White’s capture.\n\nVicky White was facing multiple charges\n\nBefore she died, Vicky White was facing new forgery and identity theft charges in Alabama, in addition to the charge of permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree that was filed last week.\n\nThe new charges were announced Monday and stemmed from the officer using an alias to purchase the vehicle used in the escape, a 2007 Ford Edge, officials said.\n\nVicky White, who was an assistant director of corrections for Lauderdale County, took Casey White from the county jail on April 29, saying she was taking him for a mental health evaluation, which authorities learned later had never been scheduled. She then said she was going to get medical care after dropping the inmate off because she wasn’t feeling well.\n\nVicky White’s use of aliases may have complicated the search, Singleton said Monday.\n\n“If she was using her own identity, that would make it fairly easy for us to maybe find her,” Singleton told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga. “We do know she used a false identification to purchase a car here locally.”.\n\nBefore Vicky White’s death, Singleton said he hoped she would survive her injuries.\n\n“We don’t wish any ill will on Vicky, but she has some answers to give us,” he said. “I have every bit of trust in (her). She had been an exemplary employee. I don’t know if we’ll ever know” what happened to change that.\n\nSurveillance video footage of Vicky White taken before the getaway showed the level of preparation that went into the escape, Singleton said.\n\nInvestigators found footage of White shopping for men’s clothes at a department store and at an “adult store,” Singleton said, adding she “obviously had a change of clothes” for the inmate.\n\n“It just tells us that it was very well planned and calculated,” Singleton said. “Obviously she well-planned this escape down to a T.”\n\nInvestigators earlier released video footage showing Vicky White at a Quality Inn in Florence, where she stayed the night before the escape more than a week ago.\n\nThe patrol car the officer and inmate took from the jail was found abandoned in a shopping center parking lot. Vicky White’s jail keys, radio and handcuffs were found inside. Authorities believe the pair left the lot in a different vehicle: Vicky White’s 2007 Ford SUV she parked in the lot the night before.\n\nThe vehicle was spotted on May 6 at a Tennessee tow lot. The car had been abandoned in the woods without any identifying information on the same day the duo escaped, indicating they drove about two hours north from the jail in Florence to Williamson County, Tennessee.\n\nAuthorities believe the vehicle may have had mechanical problems that prompted the abrupt stop in the area.\n\nVicky White and Casey White had known each other since at least 2020, the sheriff told CNN earlier this week.\n\nPrior to their disappearance, Vicky White had announced plans to retire and sold her home for a price well below market value.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's how Casey White's criminal history led him to Vicky White 02:32 • Source: CNN Here's how Casey White's criminal history led him to Vicky White 02:32\n\nThe sheriff’s office had announced on May 4 that she was no longer employed by them, adding that while April 29 was her last day of work, her retirement papers were never finalized.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had the wrong first name for US Marshal Marty Keely.", "authors": ["Theresa Waldrop Elizabeth Wolfe Jaide Timm-Garcia", "Theresa Waldrop", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Jaide Timm-Garcia"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/europe/joseph-ratzinger-pope-benedict-xvi-obituary-intl", "title": "Benedict shaped Catholic doctrine but faced criticism for ... - CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nPope Emeritus Benedict XVI, whose death at 95 was announced Saturday, was a powerful intellectual force who shaped the Catholic Church’s theology for more than a quarter century before shocking the world by resigning in 2013.\n\nWhile not quite unprecedented, Benedict’s resignation was highly unusual. Popes typically hold office until death, and the last pope to step down was Gregory XII, who quit in 1415 to end a civil war within the church.\n\nBookended by globally popular and charismatic popes – St. John Paul II and Pope Francis – Benedict cut a different figure. Friends and biographers described him as quiet and scholarly, more at home among theological tomes than adoring crowds.\n\nIn typical fashion, Benedict announced his unexpected resignation in Latin. He was 85 at the time and cited his advanced age as ill-suited for the demands of running the Catholic Church.\n\nThe German-born Benedict saw himself, and the church, as a bulwark against secular trends in Western society, particularly what he called the “dictatorship of relativism.” He often insisted that Catholics maintain a fortress mentality, saying perhaps a smaller, “purer” church would best maintain Catholicism’s traditions and teachings.\n\nAs Pope, Benedict was a polarizing figure. He was hailed by conservatives who admired his erudite writings and careful theology. But critics, particularly in the postmodern West, called him “God’s Rottweiler” for his staunch insistence on fidelity to church’s doctrine and his willingness to silence dissent.\n\n“He policed the boundaries of the faith,” said David Gibson, author of “The Rule of Benedict,” a biography of the former pope. “He was brilliant and brutally effective.”\n\nBenedict also came under fire for his handling of the sexual abuse crisis that engulfed the Catholic church during his years as a senior cleric. A damning report published in January 2022 found that he knew about priests who abused children but failed to act when he was archbishop of Munich from 1977 to 1982.\n\nThe son of a policeman\n\nJoseph Ratzinger was born and raised in Bavaria, where he briefly served in the Hitler Youth, despite his objections, and the German military during World War II. His father, a policeman, loathed the Nazis, according to biographers.\n\nRatzinger, like his elder brother Georg, saw their future in the Catholic Church, entering a German seminary in 1945. Once ordained, Ratzinger rose quickly through the church, establishing himself as a leading theologian. Originally a liberal thinker, he turned conservative in 1968 in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which upended a number of Catholic teachings.\n\nIn 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising. Later that year, former Pope Paul VI made the German scholar a cardinal, a sign of his growing reputation within the church.\n\nFrom 1981 to 2005, Ratzinger ran the Vatican’s influential Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), the office responsible for stating and policing church doctrine. He was, in effect, Catholicism’s chief theologian during this time, said Gibson, Benedict’s biographer.\n\n“His twenty-four years at the CDF were far more influential than his tenure as pope,” Gibson said.\n\nHis influence was certainly felt in the United States. In 1984, Ratzinger told the Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominicans, to investigate one of its monks, Matthew Fox, for heresy. The Vatican expelled Fox from the order in 1993.\n\nIn 1999, Ratzinger effectively silenced an American nun and priest engaged in LGBTQ ministry because they would not affirm the “Church’s teaching regarding the intrinsic evil of homosexual acts.” The nun and priest were “permanently prohibited from any pastoral work involving homosexual persons.”\n\nBut Ratzinger eventually tired of the job, reportedly asking Pope John Paul II to appoint him as a librarian at the Vatican’s library. John Paul refused.\n\n‘Please don’t do this to me’\n\nRatzinger was dean of the College of Cardinals in 2005 when he became the sixth German to be picked as pope, the first since the 11th century. At the time, the church was facing several pressing issues, including declining popularity in parts of the world and a growing crisis over its role in handling sexual abuse accusations against priests.\n\nAs the conclave to appoint Pope John Paul II’s successor went on, Ratzinger said he quickly realized that he would be elected as the new Pope – though he was reluctant to assume the mantel of St. Peter.\n\n“At a certain point, I prayed to God, ‘Please don’t do this to me,’” he told a German audience in 2005. “Evidently, this time he didn’t listen to me.”\n\nUpon his election, Ratzinger took the name Benedict XVI as a nod to church history, he said. He chose the name to honor Benedict XV, who pursued peace during World War I, and the original St. Benedict, a monk “whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe,” Ratzinger said.\n\nAt 78, he was the oldest person to have been elected pope since Pope Clement XII in 1730. Given his age, Benedict XVI was widely seen as a caretaker pope, a bridge to the next generation after the long tenure of John Paul II, a globe-trotting pontiff whose early youth and vigor gave way to such frailty in later years that he required help walking and was often hard to hear during public addresses.\n\nIn his tone, demeanor and actions, Benedict was notably different from his predecessor. Where John Paul wowed crowds around the world with his mastery of numerous languages, Benedict’s influence was felt through his erudite writings and theological rigor.\n\n“In a world which he considered relativist and secular, his main thrust was to re-establish a sense of Catholic identity for Catholics themselves,” said Delia Gallagher, CNN’s Vatican correspondent.\n\nAs Pope, Benedict often championed a back-to-basics approach. Three of his encyclicals – letters from the Pope to Catholics around the world – were based on the theological virtues of faith, hope and love.\n\nBill Donohue, of the conservative US Catholic League, credited Benedict for working to reduce friction among adherents of various faiths, something that was a key part of John Paul’s mission as well.\n\nBut critics say Benedict didn’t always choose his words wisely. During a speech in Regensburg, Germany in 2006, he quoted a 14th century Byzantine emperor who criticized Islam, calling it violent, “evil and inhuman.”\n\nHis remarks were sharply criticized by heads of states in the Middle East and Muslim groups throughout the world. Effigies of Benedict were burnt in Basra, Iraq, and elsewhere in predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nBenedict later apologized, saying he was “deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address.”\n\nCriticism over sexual abuse crisis\n\nBenedict became pope at the height of the molestation scandal involving Catholic priests, as complaints of sexual abuse and related lawsuits tore at the church and threatened its moral standing around the world.\n\nIn 2002, he asked Pope John Paul II to route all accusations of sexual abuse to his office, where he instituted changes meant to deal swiftly with accused priests. From 2004-2014, the Vatican defrocked 848 priests who raped or molested children and sanctioned another 2,572 with lesser penalties, according to the church. During that time, his office had received 3,400 accusations, according to the church.\n\nThe flood of accusations worldwide has waned at times but has never stopped.\n\nIn 2008, Benedict acknowledged “the shame which we have all felt” over abuse reports and said those responsible for the “evils” should face justice. Two years later he said abusive priests “disfigured their ministry” and brought “profound shame and regret” on the church.\n\nThat same year, 2010, he issued new rules aimed at stopping abuse. These included allowing church prosecution of suspected abusers for 20 years after the incidents occurred, up from 10 years previously. The rules also made it a church crime to download child pornography and allowed the pope to remove a priest without a formal Vatican trial.\n\nIn some cases, Benedict acted swiftly, as when he removed Marcial Maciel, a powerful Mexican priest who founded the conservative Legion of Christ, after years of allegations that he had sexually abused children.\n\n“No one did more to successfully address the problem of priestly sexual abuse than Joseph Ratzinger,” Donohue said.\n\nBut others such as the late Barbara Blaine, the former president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said the opposite was true.\n\n“I would hate for him to be remembered as someone who did the right thing because from our perspective, Pope Benedict’s record has been abysmal,” said Blaine, who died in 2017.\n\nIn 2010, The New York Times reported that church officials, including Ratzinger, had failed to act in the case of a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting up to 200 boys. The Times reported that church officials stopped proceedings against the priest after he wrote Ratzinger.\n\nAlso in 2010, the Times reported that the future pope – while serving as the archbishop in Munich – had been copied on a memo informing him that a priest accused of molesting children was being returned to pastoral work. At the time, a spokesman for the archdiocese said Ratzinger received hundreds of memos a year, and it was highly unlikely that he had read it.\n\nTwelve years later, a Church-commissioned report into abuse by Catholic clergy in the diocese found that Ratzinger had as archbishop been informed of four cases of sexual abuse involving minors – including two that had taken place while he was in office – but failed to act. In a letter published by the Vatican in February 2022, Benedict issued a general apology to survivors of abuse, writing: “Once again I can only express to all the victims of sexual abuse my profound shame, my deep sorrow and my heartfelt request for forgiveness.”\n\nOver the years, victims’ groups pressed the International Criminal Court to prosecute Benedict in the sex abuse scandal.\n\nDavid Gibson, Benedict’s biographer, said that, like many in the Vatican, the former pope was initially slow to recognize the magnitude of the church’s abuse crisis.\n\n“Like so many in the church, he was part of the learning curve,” Gibson said.\n\nThe anti-Francis\n\nUltimately, however, Benedict showed little skill or interest in governing the vast and complex world of the Catholic Church, Gibson said.\n\nIn 2012, his butler was convicted of theft for leaking confidential papal documents to fight what he saw as deep corruption within the Holy See.\n\nA year later, Benedict announced his resignation.\n\nSince then, Benedict, who chose the name Pope Emeritus and continued to wear the traditional papal white, rarely left his monastery high on a hill in Vatican City, where he promised to live a “hidden life.”\n\nStill, conservative Catholics tried to draw Benedict out, or at least use him as counterweight to the more liberal papacy of Francis. Some Catholics looked to him as an anti-Pope, or at least an anti-Francis.\n\nThe contrast between the two men was dramatized in a 2019 Netflix film, “The Two Popes,” which earned Anthony Hopkins an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Benedict.\n\nThe Rev. Joseph Fessio, an American Jesuit who studied under Benedict and has published his works at Ignatius Press, said the former Pope likely knew that conservatives were trying to pit him against Francis.\n\n“In some ways, he has become the face of ‘the Resistance,’” Fessio said, “even though he hasn’t done anything to be a resistor.”\n\nBenedict preferred to be called something more modest.\n\nBefore he left Rome in 2013, a crowd of 10,000 people gathered to bid him an emotional farewell.\n\n“I am no longer the Pope but I am still in the church,” Benedict said. “I’m just a pilgrim who is starting the last part of his pilgrimage on this earth.”", "authors": ["Daniel Burke Hada Messia", "Daniel Burke", "Hada Messia"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/us/iowa-fatal-shooting-church", "title": "Ames, Iowa church shooting: 2 dead, plus suspected shooter | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nTwo college students were shot to death Thursday evening in a church parking lot in Ames, Iowa, police said, before the shooter fatally turned his gun on himself.\n\nThe shooting at the Cornerstone Church was the result of a “domestic situation” between the shooter, a 33-year-old man from the city of Boone, and one of the women, said Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald at a news conference Friday.\n\nBoth women, ages 22 and 21, were students at nearby Iowa State University, he said.\n\nA third woman escaped unharmed, he said, adding the shooter used a 9mm handgun.\n\n“This is a very tragic event for our community but I think also nationwide as we experience violent incidents nationwide, and it only seems to increase,” said Capt.

Gun massacres have left the country shaken and prompted new discussions about how to prevent them.

The Christmas storm that dumped many feet of snow across most of America was mostly over by Monday. Still, Southwest Airlines canceled another 2,300 flights today, long after its rivals had resumed normal service.\n\nThe airline said it is set to resume normal schedules on Friday. Why did Southwest take so long to get its operations back on track?\n\nSouthwest got unlucky with the location of the storm and its timing. The company also has a unique operations model, focused on smaller planes going to smaller cities, that failed spectacularly when America went into a deep freeze and was blanketed with snow. And outdated scheduling technology left Southwest scrambling to match crew with planes.\n\nThe airline purposefully reduced its flight schedule by two thirds this week to reset its operations, which CEO Bob Jordan likened to re-assembling a giant puzzle. Southwest aims to to resume normal service by the end of the week.\n\nAre you stranded in an airport because of Southwest? Share your story.\n\nBad luck\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport. And the so-called “tripledemic” has been surging across America, leaving people and their families – including workers at Southwest and their families – sick with Covid, the flu and RSV.\n\nSouthwest said that prior to the storm last week, staff levels at the Denver airport became so low that it enacted “operational emergency” staffing procedures. Denver quickly developed into one of the nation’s biggest problem spots for cancellations.\n\nAlthough Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nOperations snafu\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which caused some of the problems during the storm. Unlike its rivals, which operate with a “hub-and-spoke” model, Southwest prides itself with a “point-to-point” business strategy that allows passengers to travel directly between smaller markets.\n\n“We don’t have the normal hub like the other major airlines do,” Capt. Mike Santoro, vice president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, told CNN Tuesday. “We fly a point-to-point network, which can put our crews in the wrong places, without airplanes.”\n\nUnited, American and Delta typically fly from smaller markets to hubs, requiring passengers flying between small cities to change planes. But that model has the operational advantage of quickly flying crews and planes out of the hub to where they’re needed.\n\nSouthwest’s “point-to-point” model involves planes flying consecutive routes and picking up crews at those locations.\n\n“When they have cancellations in one area, it really ripples through, because they don’t necessarily have their crews and their pilots in the right positions,” said Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst of equity research for Edward Jones. “They just kind of build on from city to city to city, and when that gets disrupted, it’s very difficult to get the operations flowing smoothly again.”\n\nSantoro said Southwest’s meltdown was the worst disruption he’d experienced in 16 years at the airline.\n\nBad tech\n\nSouthwest’s outdated scheduling software couldn’t keep up with the constant changes, and quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of a call Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson conducted with employees that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nWatterson explained that Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nSouthwest says it is confident it will soon resume normal operations. It has just 39 cancellations planned Friday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\nMike Santoro told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Wednesday that pilots have been told the airline is planning for a “mostly full schedule come Friday.”\n\nBut now the company faces an investigation by the Department of Transportation and the Denver airport.\n\nWall Street expressed concern that the debacle could cost Southwest. Investors sold off the stock, erasing $2 billion in market value from the company’s shares over the course of a week. The airline’s stock price bounced back nearly 3% Thursday, but remains down about 9% since the closing price on December 23, just before the mass cancellations.\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt, Greg Wallace and Alicia Wallace contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/11/06/list-airports-flight-reductions/87112549007/", "title": "Which 40 airports are facing flight reductions?

No one was injured in the incident and the flight made a safe emergency landing back at Portland International Airport.\n\nIn a statement on Boeing's website, the aircraft company says: \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers. We agree with and fully support the FAA's decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane. In addition, a Boeing technical team is supporting the NTSB's investigation into last night's event. We will remain in close contact with our regulator and customers.\"\n\nBut the involvement of the 737 Max airplane — previous safety concerns about the aircraft led to it being grounded for nearly two years — suggests there could be repercussions for the already troubled airplane fleet.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has sent investigators to Portland to investigate the incident involving the 737 MAX 9, Flight 1282 bound for Ontario, California.\n\nFAA grounding: FAA temporarily grounds some Boeing planes after Alaska Airlines jet returns with big hole\n\nBoeing 737 Max 9 aircrafts grounded by FAA, Alaska Airlines\n\nThe FAA said its Emergency Airworthiness Directive, affecting about 171 airplanes worldwide, would require inspections taking four to eight hours. \"Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB's investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282,\" the agency said.\n\nBefore the FAA made their decision, Alaska Airlines had announced that it would be grounding its fleet of 65 Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes. But on Saturday, shortly before the FAA statement, Alaska Airlines said in a post on X that inspections had been done on more than a quarter of its 737 MAX 9 aircraft with \"no concerning findings.\" Flights on the fleet will return to service after successful inspections.\n\nSince the aircraft is used by other airlines including United Airlines, Copa Airlines, Aeromexico and Turkish Airlines — according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics company — other international agencies will be interested in any findings, too.\n\nUnited Airlines released a statement to USA Today saying: \"United has temporarily suspended service on select Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft to conduct an inspection required by the FAA. We are working directly with impacted customers to find them alternative travel options.:\n\nUSA Today spoke with Shem Malmquist, instructor at college of aeronautics at the Florida Institute of Technology about the Alaska Airlines grounding.\n\n\"To the extent that they need to do anything, the question is do they need to ground all the airplanes and look at other ones or can they look at this and say, this was just this particular configuration?\" said Malmquist, a current Boeing 777 captain and experienced accident and safety investigator. \"Until they've looked at it nobody is going to be able to give you a truthful answer.\"\n\nWhat happened to the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet on Alaska Airlines?\n\nAlaska Airlines Flight 1282 was at about 16,000 feet shortly after takeoff when the window and a chunk of the fuselage blew out as the plane. The crew reported a \"pressurization issue,\" according to the Federal Aviation Administration. One of the pilots declared an emergency and asked for clearance to descend to 10,000 feet (3 kilometers), the altitude where the air would have enough oxygen to breathe safely.\n\n\"We need to turn back to Portland,” the pilot told controllers in a calm voice that she maintained throughout the landing process.\n\nPassenger Kyle Rinker described to CNN how \"it was really abrupt. Just got to altitude, and the window/wall just popped off and didn’t notice it until the oxygen masks came off.” He posted a picture on X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe Alaska Airlines plane apparently had \"plugged\" a section of the plane that could be used as an exit door, with another cabin piece without a door, Malmquist said. The number of exit doors needed on a plane is based on the seating configuration, with more exits required as the number of passengers accommodated rises.\n\nWithout an exit door there \"it's a bit lighter ... and it is a pretty big advantage to do that,\" Malmquist said. If it's determined that this configuration caused the incident, other airlines may not have to cancel any other flights, he said.\n\nWhat could the Alaska Airlines incident mean for other airlines?\n\nAlaska Airlines and investigators will look at whether the incident was caused by \"that configuration or is it a general, larger problem,\" Malmquist said. \"If it's a larger problem it's a big mess because that means it could open other doors or other windows. If it's just the plug windows, that greatly narrows the scope.\"\n\nAny other airline that uses a similar configuration – plugging that exit door – \"is probably going to be proactive,\" he said. \"Airlines that are operating a different configuration may take more of a 'wait and see' (approach). They are going to be watching it closely.\"\n\nWhat is the history of the Boeing 737 Max?\n\nThe aircraft involved in Friday's incident is a new addition to the Alaska Airlines fleet, having received its certification just two months ago, The Associated Press reported. It had flown 145 flights since entering commercial service on Nov. 11, according to FlightRadar24, another tracking service. The flight from Portland was the aircraft’s third of the day.\n\nThe Max is the newest version of Boeing’s venerable 737, a twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on U.S. domestic flights.\n\nThe plane, which went into service in May 2017, has had controversy. Two Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people, resulting in a near two-year worldwide grounding of all Max 8 and Max 9 planes. The planes returned to service only after Boeing made changes to an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.\n\nLast year, the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane.\n\nAnd in December, the company told airlines to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.\n\nMalmquist is concerned these continued issues come as a result of Boeing's concern for costs over safety, as the company has offered senior engineers and other employees to retire. \"In the entire process, there's a strong incentive to reduce costs and I thin that although people who are in management realize that experience matters in management they don't necessarily realize that also equally applies to all the other various areas,\" he said.\n\nWhat rights do passengers have when an airline grounds its fleets?\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation's air consumer website, Alaska Airlines has committed to several remedies for passengers affected by \"controllable\" cancellations.\n\nThose commitments include rebooking travelers on the airline or a partner airline at no additional cost.\n\nPassengers can be given meal, meal cash or vouchers by Alaska Airlines when a cancellation forces them to wait more than three hours for a new flight. They can also receive hotel accommodations, and transportation to and from the hotel, from Alaska Airlines if affected by an overnight cancellation.\n\nPassengers can receive credit, travel vouchers or frequent flyer miles if the canceled flight results in them waiting three hours or more from the scheduled departure time.\n\nBut, according to the DOT website, passengers cannot receive compensation from Alaska Airlines if a cancellation causes a person to wait more than three hours from the departure time.\n\nWhat should travelers learn from the incident?\n\nIn the near-term, if you are traveling soon, check to see if you are traveling on this type of airplane. \"I would consider seeing if you can switch,\" Malmquist said. \"I would see what I can do to take a slightly later flight. That seems to me the logical thing.\"\n\nAnd anytime, travelers should learn to fasten their seatbelts when on a flight. \"I don't ever sit down without my seatbelt buckled,\" Malmquist said. \"More likely, you will hit some turbulence for whatever reason that's not expected and you go flying into the ceiling.

It warned that the planes require a software update. An issue with the flight control software was identified and airlines will be required to correct the problem before their planes are permitted to fly again.\n\nAccording to Airbus, approximately 6,000 planes worldwide were affected, and as of Monday morning in Europe, less than 100 remained to be modified.\n\n\"The vast majority have now received the necessary modifications,\" the company's statement said. \"Airbus apologises for any challenges and delays caused to passengers and airlines by this event.\"\n\nBecause Airbus planes are manufactured by a European company, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued the initial order. The Federal Aviation Administration subsequently issued an immediate emergency order requiring airlines to update or replace faulty elevator-aileron control software on about 545 Airbus aircraft — banning further use of the affected software — and mandating the fixes before the planes can fly again with a deadline of midnight on Sunday, Nov. 30.\n\nNeed a news break?

The autopilot remained engaged throughout the event, with a brief and limited loss of altitude, and the rest of the flight was uneventful,\" EASA's Emergency Airworthiness Directive said.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued its own order, requiring U.S. airlines to complete the necessary work by 12:01 a.m. on Nov. 30.\n\nThis type of radiation can temporarily corrupt the data used by the plane’s flight-control computers, which help pilots steer and keep the aircraft stable.\n\n\"This condition, if not corrected, could lead in the worst-case scenario to an uncommanded elevator movement that may result in exceeding the aircraft’s structural capability,\" the directive continued.\n\nThe agency's order requires airlines to implement it before the next flight, which could lead to disruptions as airlines work to update the software in their aircraft or replace onboard equipment.\n\nAirbus acknowledged the situation in a statement.\n\n\"Airbus has worked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an Alert Operators Transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly,\" the statement said.\n\nHow are US airlines responding?\n\nU.S. airlines largely completed the necessary work without significant operational disruptions over the Thanksgiving weekend. Severe weather was a major driver of air travel headaches as people returned from their holiday plans.\n\nStatements from Airbus and airlines during the initial phase of the issue emphasized safety and said passengers shouldn't feel they need to switch flights if they are scheduled to fly on an A320-family aircraft. The issue is being handled proactively and transparently, and airlines are making sure their planes are airworthy before releasing them for departure.\n\n(This story was updated to refresh headlines and add new information.)\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter and writes the Cruising Altitude column for USA TODAY.

Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency for all of New York. \"We are prepared to deploy resources to areas affected by the severe weather caused by the remnants of Debby,\" she posted on X. \"Please stay safe, monitor your local forecasts, and keep off the roads.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the National Weather Service had issued flash flood emergencies in multiple counties and towns near the New York-Pennsylvania border, reporting that neighborhoods had been inundated by life-threatening flash flooding, which cut off access to roads and homes and triggered water rescues.\n\nThe rare alerts, urging people to seek higher ground, were issued for New York's Steuben County, as well as neighboring Allegany County, where 4 and 4.5 inches of rain had fallen by the afternoon. Another flood emergency alert was issued for the town of Westfield in north-central Pennsylvania, while officials in Binghamton, New York, reported impassable roadways. Meanwhile, water rescues were underway in Greene County, Virginia.\n\nThe major flooding was not limited to the Northeast. Rescue operations were also ongoing in South Carolina as rivers and streams continued overflowing. In Savannah, Georgia, the city closed roadways on Friday citing the continued swelling and flooding of the Ogeechee River, according to a post on X from Mayor Van Johnson.\n\nWeather alerts via text: Sign-up to get updates about current storms and weather events by location.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the city's metro experienced delays because of reported flooding. Flights at airports in the capital city and New York were temporarily grounded, and average delay times exceeded one hour, frustrating travelers.\n\nSince Monday, when Debby made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida, the storm has plunged entire communities under water, spawned tornadoes and led to the deaths of at least eight people across North Carolina, Georgia and Florida.\n\nWhere is Tropical Storm Debby? Maps track path, flooding, rain, where it already hit\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ A flash flood warning had been issued for Washington, D.C. Friday morning, but had expired by early afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. \"Turn around, don't drown! If you're walking or driving toward a flooded road, find another route,\" said the district's Homeland Security and Emergency Management.\n\n◾ Overnight, the weather service received reports of at least three possible tornadoes in the Mid-Atlantic region: one in New Castle, Delaware, and the others in Caroline and Stafford, Virginia. Crews with the weather service will inspect the damage to determine whether tornadoes had touched down.\n\n◾ In New York City, the state's Department of Emergency Management issued a travel advisory, warning of 1 to 2 inches of rain as well as potential flash flooding, damaging winds and \"brief tornadoes.\"\n\nDebby was early, researcher says\n\nDebby was the second hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, following in the footsteps of deadly and devastating Hurricane Beryl. Debby, which formed Aug. 2, was also quite early: On average, the second Atlantic hurricane usually forms on Aug. 26, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nIn addition, Debby, which smashed into Steinhatchee, Florida, on Monday, was the 4th hurricane to make landfall in Florida in August since 2000. The other three were: Charley (2004), Katrina (2005) and Idalia (2023).\n\nWhere is Debby?\n\nDebby was 160 miles northeast of Pittsburgh and 215 miles south-southwest of Albany, according to the National Hurricane Center's 11 a.m. update.\n\nThe storm was moving northeast at 37 mph and had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, according to the hurricane center. Through most of the week, the storm moved at a slow pace in the single digits, dropping as low as 4 and 5 mph while it dumped over a foot of rain from Florida to North Carolina.\n\nThrough Friday night, bands of rain are expected to lash a swath of the Northeast while threats of tornadoes and winds capable of toppling trees and utility poles remain, the weather service said.\n\nHeat wave follows Debby\n\nIn the wake of Debby, a sweltering heat wave was forecast for Florida and the Deep South on Friday. Temperatures were expected to reach well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit across the region. Calling the heat \"dangerous,\" the National Weather Service in New Orleans advised residents \"to stay safe, take breaks in the shade or air conditioning, drink plenty of water, check on the elderly, and bring pets indoors!\"\n\nAuthorities continue rescue operations in South Carolina\n\nWhile Debby’s most intense conditions began bearing down on the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Friday, the Carolinas still faced rounds of heavy rain as rivers continued to crest, triggering additional water rescues.\n\nIn Berkeley County, just north of Charleston, South Carolina, “rescue operations have been ongoing throughout the early morning hours on Friday,” the county said in a statement on Facebook.\n\nThe rescue came as flooding continued “worsening along several creeks and streams across portions of Dorchester and Berkeley Counties,” the weather service in Charleston said. The high water cut off access to several main roads, forcing officials to close county offices and urge residents to avoid traveling in some areas.\n\nIn Berkeley County, as much as 14 inches has fallen this week, while Charleston recorded rainfall totals as high as 15 inches, according to the weather service.\n\nDebby's death toll climbs to at least 8\n\nOfficials in North Carolina's Rockingham County said a woman's body was discovered on Thursday in a mobile home that had been partially crushed by a tree – the latest death authorities have connected to Debby.\n\nThe Rockingham Sheriff's Office identified the woman as 78-year-old Hilda Windsor Jones. She, according to the sheriff's office, lived at home alone and was in her bathroom when the tree toppled over \"due to weather from the remnants of Hurricane Debby.\"\n\nIn Wilson County, about 150 miles northeast of Rockingham, a search and rescue team discovered the body of an adult male inside a home that was damaged by a tornado that ripped through the town of Lucama, Stephen Mann, director of communication for Wilson County, previously told USA TODAY. The twister damaged at least four homes as well as a church and a middle school.\n\nOfficials have tied Debby to at least six other deaths, five in Florida and one in Georgia. In the southern Georgia city of Moultrie, a tree fell onto a home, killing a 19-year-old. In Florida, two adults and a 12-year-old girl were killed in fatal vehicle accidents; also, a 13-year-old boy died after a tree landed on a mobile home; and officials on Tuesday found the body of a boater who had been missing near the city of Gulfport.\n\nEmergency crews begin water rescues in Virginia amid downpour\n\nOfficials in Greene County, Virginia, said water rescues began early Friday as remnants of Debby continued its deluge, soaking roads and bridges under several inches of floodwater.\n\n“Please refrain from travel if possible – specifically in the Stanardsville District – where flooded roadways and bridges are an issue,” said a statement released at 6 a.m. by officials in Greene County, 90 miles northwest of Richmond.\n\nRoads across the state were closed as low-lying and coastal areas flooded and rivers crested. Torrential downpours continued across Virginia on Friday after starting up a day earlier, when Debby inched up from North Carolina. Within the last 24 hours, up to 8 inches of rain fell across parts of Virginia, according to the weather service.\n\nFlights temporarily grounded at major airports in NYC, Washington\n\nFlights at multiple major airports across the Northeast were temporarily grounded as the remnants of Debby moved over the region, causing a slew of delays and travel disruptions.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said ground stops were issued at New York City’s LaGuardia International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nAfter the ground stops were lifted, those airports as well as John F. Kennedy Airport, Newark International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport reported average departure delays between 30 minutes and an hour, according to the FAA.\n\nOver 100,000 without power in the East; Ohio has nearly 200,000 outages\n\nIn the eastern U.S., more than 100,000 homes and businesses were in the dark Friday afternoon as Debby barreled across the Mid-Atlantic region and officials struggled to restore power across Ohio, where nearly 200,000 utility customers remain without power.\n\nThe most outages in the eastern U.S. were in Pennsylvania, where some 78,000 utility customers were without power, according to Poweroutage.us. Virginia reported 15,000 and Maryland 18,000.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ohio, more than 189,000 homes and businesses were without power after storms broke out across the state on Tuesday, spawning tornadoes, damaging property and, at its peak, over 300,000 outages.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2024/01/12/wisconsin-live-snow-updates-forecast-radar-totals-road-conditions/72194282007/", "title": "Wisconsin live snow updates: snow totals, road conditions, outages", "text": "Jan. 12, 2024 Updated Jan. 13, 2024, 9:05 p.m. ET\n\nIt turned out to be a snowy Friday in Wisconsin.\n\nAfter two rounds of snow this week — Tuesday and overnight Wednesday — the state got hit again. And thousands of We Energies customers - primarily in Milwaukee and Waukesha counties - are without power.\n\n7 p.m.: Milwaukee declares a snow emergency\n\nThe City of Milwaukee has declared a snow emergency from 10 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Monday. The declaration largely impacts parking regulations so plows can tend to city streets.\n\nThere is no parking on main streets (arterials) from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. and alternate side parking is required on side streets from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Posted street signs take precedence.\n\nAll vehicles parked on side streets must be on the odd-numbered side of the street by 10 p.m.\n\nTo look up arterials visit milwaukee.gov/parkingregulations.\n\nDesignated Milwaukee Public Schools lots will be available for off-street parking.

The warming shelters include Milwaukee County's Hillview, Greater Galilee Baptist Church, Guest House Milwaukee, Repairers of the Breach, The Milwaukee Rescue Mission and St. Ben's.\n\nSince Friday's initial outages, We Energies has restored the power of over 160,000 customers. Over 68,000 customers still await power restoration.\n\nPublic Works Commissioner Jerrel Kruschke said that his department is working to address 17 water main breaks throughout the area, threats to tree canopy due to heavy snow and icy roadways.\n\nAcross the state, 30 to 40 mph winds will intensify cold conditions. Wet and heavy snowfall and dropping temperatures have heightened concerns about \"deep freeze\" conditions on Sunday, according to Kruschke. The sub-zero temperatures can cause shoveled snow mounds to harden and become icy blockage points for drivers. The extreme weather also slows down road cleaning and electric crews.\n\nResidents are instructed to contact 211 in emergency weather situations.\n\n12 p.m.: We Energies says its working to restore power\n\nEarly Saturday afternoon, We Energies tweeted that power has been restored to 130,000 customers that experienced outages. About 73,500 customers - including about 33,000 in Milwaukee County -- remain without power in the utility's service area.\n\nThe company expects more outages throughout the day but has enlisted hundreds of employees to monitor and address outages across the state.\n\nWe Energies recommends assembling safety kits in case of lost power. These include, flashlights, extra batteries, bottled water, first-aid kit, portable charging pack for cell phones and mobile devices and specialty items for infants, seniors or disabled family members.\n\nWe Energies customers can report outages to law enforcement, on the We Energies website or app, and by calling their outage hotline 800-662-4797.\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\n11:30 a.m.: National Weather Service issues cold weather warnings through the weekend\n\nThe National Weather Service issued high wind and cold weather warnings on Saturday, predicting that temperatures will drop by 20 degrees on Saturday evening and remain under 10 degrees through Tuesday.\n\nA NWS wind chill advisory warns of of 20 to 30 mph wind gusts through Monday.\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\n9:30 a.m.: Power outages impact over 90,000 customers\n\nOn Saturday morning, WE Energies reported that 92,086 Wisconsin residents were impacted by power outages following Friday's snow storm.\n\nThe outages are largely concentrated to We Energies customers in southeastern Wisconsin. According to statements made on We Energies website, many downed power lines came as a consequence of heavy snow, fallen tree branches and vehicle collisions with power poles.\n\nMore than 60,000 customers power was restored by Friday evening but worsening conditions have continued to impact neighborhoods across the state.\n\nIf customers see any downed wires, stay at least 25 feet away and report it to We Energies or law enforcement.\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nTake a look at Wisconsin's weather radar\n\n10:35 p.m.: Dozens of crashes on Milwaukee County freeways\n\nMilwaukee County sheriff's deputies were dispatched to 121 calls for service on area highways Friday, as of 10 p.m.\n\nThe sheriff's office said 35 crashes were reported, including four that resulted in injuries.

Of those, 15,432 of those are in Milwaukee.\n\nAnother 4,033 We Energies customers are without power in Waukesha County, the map said.\n\nStatewide, there are more than 23,523 We Energies customers without power and 215 outages, according to the map.\n\n8 a.m.: Crash closes northbound lanes along I-43; driving conditions are poor and slippery\n\nAnother snowy morning commute for drivers in the Milwaukee metro area has already resulted in at least one major incident. A full highway closure is underway of the northbound lanes on Interstate 43 due to a crash. Traffic is being diverted onto Highway 57.\n\nThere is also a disabled vehicle that has closed the ramp from Interstate 94 West to Interstate 41/894 South.\n\nThere are other reports of disabled vehicles and slippery conditions, so be sure to take it slow this morning. Snow is expected to fall throughout the day and accumulate several inches. The National Weather Service recommends that you only drive if you have to, and if you do, go slow and give yourself more time to get to your destination.\n\nYou can find the most up-to-date road conditions on 511 Wisconsin’s website.\n\n— Drew Dawson\n\n7:50 a.m.: Milwaukee got 2 inches of snow before 7 a.m.; latest forecast predicts strong winds, poor driving conditions\n\nSnow is quickly accumulating Friday morning as two inches fell before 7 a.m. in the Milwaukee area, causing issues on area roadways, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn Milwaukee and southeastern Wisconsin, snow will continue into Friday with estimated totals between three to six inches. At the lakefront, temperatures hovering around freezing could mean that there will be a mixture of rain and snow.\n\nIn Milwaukee, wind gusts are at 20 miles per hour and are expected to pick up to upward of 40 miles per hour as the day goes on.\n\nGreater snow totals and stronger winds are expected in Green Bay and Door County with upwards of a foot of snow.\n\n— Alex Groth\n\n7:45 a.m.: Many airlines flying out of Milwaukee are allowing passengers to change their travel plans for free\n\n“Due to this weekend's winter storm, many of our airlines are allowing passengers to change their travel plans for free,” Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport tweeted Thursday. “Some airlines may delay or cancel flights on Friday or Saturday. Be sure to check with your airline for the latest flight status or to change your itinerary.”\n\nSeveral Friday flights have been marked as canceled on the airport website's “Departures” page.

And, all available salt and plow trucks will be actively working.\n\n“This is expected to be a long duration, challenging event,” the email said. “Staff will work as quickly as possible to manage heavy snowfall with high winds and blowing snow before temperatures plummet. Please be patient.”\n\nWith snow expected to be falling during the morning commute, DPW asked that:\n\nDrivers be safe and drive for conditions.\n\nGive space to salt and plow trucks when you encounter them.\n\nThe department also shared these other tips to be helpful during a snow operation:\n\nBe patient and understanding as snow and ice operations take time. All streets will be cleared.\n\nDrive carefully and stay on main transportation routes as much as possible.\n\nOnly travel if “absolutely necessary.”\n\nSlow down and provide more space for braking.\n\nPark legally and follow alternate side parking rules. Parking farther away from driveways, alleys and intersections allows DPW’s equipment to get through.\n\nDon’t shovel, blow or plow snow back into the streets.\n\nShovel your sidewalk and corners within 24 hours after the snow has stopped falling. And, assist neighbors who need help.\n\nClear fire hydrant near your property of snow and ice.\n\nClear snow and ice around and on top of your garbage and recycling carts.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\n6:35 a.m.: Milwaukee County, Franklin issue snow emergencies\n\nMilwaukee County and Franklin have both declared a snow emergency ahead of the impending snowfall.\n\nWorking with the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management, County Executive David Crowley declared a snow emergency for Friday, according to an email from his office.\n\nThat means all non-essential departments will be closed Friday, which include several county facilities, such as the Milwaukee County Courthouse, Vel Phillips Detention Center and the Marcia P. Coggs Building (except for the Behavioral Health Mobile Crisis Teams).\n\nAccording to the email, certain departments and positions are essential to performing duties during the snow emergency, and will resume work as usual. Non-essential “Telework Able” employees should telework.\n\nUnsheltered residents are to call 211 for info on the closest warming center and for help accessing a shelter through a coordinated intake process, the email said.\n\nFranklin’s snow emergency, which began shortly before 5:30 a.m. Friday, will go through 6 p.m. Saturday, according to an email from Franklin Police. No street parking is allowed during this period, the email said.\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nHow much snow is the Friday storm expected to bring to the Milwaukee area?\n\n\"It's gonna be another tricky storm,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Ben Miller said Thursday. \"Not similar to the last one, but given the warm Lake Michigan temperatures and the warm December we had, it could impact snow totals again near the lakeshore.\"\n\nWith temperatures around freezing during the day, the lakeshore communities, especially to the south, could see a wintry mix or even rain during the day.\n\nAreas along the lakeshore, though, should still see 3 to 6 inches on the ground.\n\nWe'll update this file with the latest on the winter storm and the situation around Wisconsin with snowfall totals, school closings, road conditions and any power outages.\n\nFor those farther away from the lake, even by just a few miles, temperatures also around freezing could create wintry-mix conditions during the day, but they should see snow even into the afternoon. He said any wintry mix will change back to snow quickly. The inland communities are forecasted to get 5 to 10 inches with some pockets getting 10 to 12, Miller said.\n\nHow much snow will the rest of Wisconsin get?\n\nEastern, northeastern and central Wisconsin are expected to get between 6 and 12 inches of snow from the storm, according to the National Weather Service in Green Bay.\n\nThe areas along the Lake Michigan shoreline are expected to get the most snow, closer to 8 inches.\n\nFurther north and in north central Wisconsin, the snowfall amount tapers off.\n\nSome of the biggest snow totals in the state are expected in south central and southwest Wisconsin. The National Weather Service in La Crosse projects much of the area, including Madison, to get between 11 and 18 inches. La Cross is expected to get 9 to 15 inches.\n\nThe snow Friday will bring an arctic blast and below zero temperatures\n\nThe snow will bring with it the first arctic blast and below-zero temperatures of the season. That weather comes into the area Friday night and into Saturday. Temperatures will slowly drop on Saturday and into Sunday when they fall below zero, Miller said.\n\nSunday, Monday and Tuesday will see highs in the single digits and lows below zero. That could be the case on Wednesday and Thursday. Regardless, temperatures are expected to be in the high teens or lower single digits or below zero the rest of the week.\n\n\"It's going to come in and stick around for a while,\" Miller said. \"The longer we go into the season with above-normal temperatures, the bigger the shock it's going to feel like when it finally decides to dip.\"\n\nWhere can I find the latest Wisconsin winter weather road conditions?\n\nCheck out the the 511 WI website for the latest traffic updates and any road closures across Wisconsin.

The Department of Labor said it is ending in-person service at the Crump Senior Center because of health and safety concerns related to the coronavirus. The last dates for such service will be Monday and Tuesday. Appointments for those days will be available on the ADOL website www.labor.alabama.gov. Claimants can call (800) 361-4524 beginning Sunday after 5 p.m. until midnight on Sundays through Thursday to schedule a call-back for the next day to set up an appointment. Claimants are encouraged to keep their phones near them for their scheduled call-back, the department said. The calls will come from a Montgomery number. State officials have struggled to keep pace with a staggering number of unemployment claims spurred by the pandemic.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: A remote village has received its first delivery of the coronavirus vaccine by boat after it traveled through choppy waters during a storm that prevented air travel. The journey allowed first responders in the village of Seldovia (population 430) to receive the Pfizer vaccine for the virus, The Homer News reported. Usually, nurses and nurse practitioners from the SVT Health & Wellness Center in Homer travel weekly by air to Seldovia to help with health care in the village. But on Dec. 17, poor visibility meant a small boat was needed to transfer a crew of four medical personnel and the vaccines to the village about 250 miles south of Anchorage. Capt. Curtis Jackson, owner and operator of the boat, said conditions were rough with up to 4-foot waves and “pretty poor” visibility. The crew, which included a nurse, two nurse practitioners and a medical assistant, traveled for about an hour across Kachemak Bay, usually a 30-minute trip, said Jackson, a captain for Mako’s Water Taxi. “That little blue box was the best Christmas present a tired boat captain could ask for, my friends,” Jackson said in a post on Facebook. “This might be the start of what’s getting to be better and better news. It’s pretty emotional.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Arizona residents should show empathy and kindness to help ease each other’s burdens in the face of the pandemic and other troubles, the state’s top education official said. Economic and social hardships encountered by many people in 2020 left them exhausted, isolated and frustrated, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman wrote in a commentary published Saturday by the Arizona Republic. “Act as if the person you are speaking with just lost a job, a home, a loved one, a future. Act as if they are scared, or lonely, or tired to their bones,” Hoffman wrote. In education, teachers faced challenges getting the internet to work for their students and their own children, and school board members were worn down by painful decisions amid concerns about the well-being of students, Hoffman wrote. Meanwhile, she wrote, Arizona’s pandemic death toll has topped 8,000 people. “Each loss represents a valued member of our communities, and in some cases, our schools,” she wrote. Hoffman shared that the pandemic has affected her personal life, including when COVID-19 mitigation strategies meant she couldn’t be with her father when he was hospitalized for acute heart failure and then had a successful heart transplant. Also because of virus mitigation measures, her husband couldn’t be at her side when she heard that news, “I became one of the many Americans who learned to cope with loss in isolation, sharing our heartbreak over text messages and calls instead,” she said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Arkansas fell Saturday but remained near their recent record high as state health officials reported more than 700 news cases and three more deaths linked to the disease. The Department of Health said there were 1,059 Arkansas residents hospitalized Saturday, a drop of three from the day before. The state record was set Wednesday, when there were 1,110 patients hospitalized with the disease. There were 660 newly confirmed coronavirus cases and 42 more probable cases Saturday, according to the department. Health officials have warned holiday gatherings and travel are likely to further spread the virus. Over the last seven days, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in Arkansas have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Health inspectors and authorities stepped up enforcement at restaurants and shopping malls over the post-Christmas weekend as they seek to curb a coronavirus surge that has filled some hospitals in California well beyond normal capacity. Crowding at Los Angeles County shopping malls came under scrutiny before the holiday. Several of them were cited and fined up to $500 for violating COVID-19 measures, which could include not keeping occupancy below 20% capacity and not prohibiting eating and drinking, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Health officials were waiting to see whether people followed their pleas and avoided Christmas and New Year’s festivities that could lead to a new round of infections and threaten to extend stay-at-home orders in several regions of the state. Beverly Hills police halted a plan for a secret New Year’s Eve dinner at La Scala after the Italian restaurant circulated invitations to a “discreet” meal that would violate the county’s ban on indoor dining. In Sonoma County in California’s wine country, a Native American casino announced it was canceling a planned private New Year’s Eve indoor event that could have drawn as many as 4,000 people. The Graton Resort and Casino is on sovereign native land that isn’t subject to state or county health orders, but it had come under scrutiny for the event.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: About 120 black-footed ferrets, among the most endangered mammals in North America, were injected with an experimental coronavirus vaccine aimed at protecting the small, weasel-like creatures rescued from the brink of extinction four decades ago. The effort came months before U.S. Department of Agriculture officials began accepting applications from veterinary drug makers for a commercial vaccine for minks, a close cousin of the ferrets. Farmed minks, raised for their valuable fur, have died by the tens of thousands in the U.S. and been culled by the millions in Europe after catching the coronavirus from infected humans. Vaccinating such vulnerable species against the disease is important not only for the animals’ sake, experts said, but potentially for the protection of people. Some of the most pernicious human diseases have originated in animals, including the new coronavirus, which is believed to have spread from bats to an intermediary species before jumping to humans and sparking the pandemic. For the newly vaccinated ferrets, the main risk is to the animals themselves. They’re part of a captive population at the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center outside Fort Collins, where there have been no cases of COVID-19 to date. But the slender, furry creatures – known for their distinctive black eye mask, legs and feet – are feared to be highly vulnerable to the ravages of the disease, said Tonie Rocke, a research scientist at the National Wildlife Health Center who is testing the ferret vaccine. They’re all genetically similar, having come from a narrow breeding pool, which weakens their immune systems. And they likely share many of the features that have made the disease so deadly to minks. “We don’t have direct evidence that black-footed ferrets are susceptible to COVID-19, but given their close relationship to minks, we wouldn’t want to find out,” Rocke said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Residents, businesses and landlords are getting a three-month grace period on taxes because of the COVID-19 pandemic – but how much they will end up paying will depend on where they live. In some towns, the tax deferment will be interest-free and in others it will come with a lowered interest rate. Whether taxpayers need to apply for the deferment also varies from town to town, the Hartford Courant reported. The tax deferments apply to real estate, motor vehicle and personal property taxes. Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order in the spring instructing towns to defer July tax payments for three months at zero interest or lower the interest to 0.25% monthly. He recently extended the order to cover tax payments due Friday. Taxpayers applying for the deferment must show their household had an income loss of at least 20% because of the pandemic. Businesses must show their expected revenue will decrease at least 30% during the deferment period. Hartford and numerous towns in Hartford County are offering interest-free deferment, the newspaper reported, while Berlin and Enfield are offering a lowered interest rate. Windsor will give the deferment automatically, town tax collector Cathleen Eliot told the Courant, and South Windsor will require an application. The state Office of Policy Management website contains a list of towns and their policies.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:For the first time in three months, the daily number of people hospitalized because of complications of COVID-19 in Delaware has dropped for three straight days – a welcomed development as officials in Delaware and elsewhere brace for what could come next following the end-of-year holidays. As of Friday night, 400 people statewide were being treated in a hospital for their coronavirus symptoms. That’s down from 454 on Dec. 22; 426 on Dec. 23; and 404 on Dec. 24 – an overall drop of 12% over three days. It’s the first time the daily number has dropped for three straight days since a four-day stretch ending on Sept. 24, when just 53 people in Delaware were hospitalized. The dip in hospitalizations comes while thousands might have spent the Christmas holiday traveling and at family gatherings and religious services. “Although we would like to be encouraged with the downward trend of hospitalizations, we are concerned that a similar increase after Thanksgiving can be seen with Christmas/New Year’s,” Division of Public Health spokeswoman Jen Brestel said in an email Saturday. “Hospitalization is also a lagging indicator, so we may see a change weeks after any trends in new positive cases.” Cases in Delaware were mounting before Thanksgiving, but the post-Thanksgiving surge saw the average seven-day daily case count climb from 469 cases on Thanksgiving to a peak of 823.7 three weeks later on Dec. 16. That number has decreased to 621.4 through Friday, a day when the state reported 798 new cases.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Because of the pandemic, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception was forced to use tickets and advanced registration for the first time for its Mass on Christmas Day, WUSA-TV reported. The purpose of the ticketed admission was to limit the number of people attending. Attending Mass on Christmas is a tradition for many families in the D.C. area, and also acted as a tool for others to help fill a void this year. “My sons weren’t able – I asked them not to come out of safety. So, I came here to sort of fill myself up,” Trish Earnest told WUSA9. Parishioners believed it was necessary to be in church as they near the end of a trying year. “The spiritual part of it, it was really special because we could, even throughout everything, we were really grateful that we could still come out and to celebrate Jesus and Christmas,” Eve Muir said. With capacity limits and other COVID-19 restrictions, the ceremony was not one would typically expect. “They made sure everyone was far away from each other, and using hand sanitizer, and keeping their masks on,” Earnest said. “But it was a beautiful service.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Some South Florida counties have put into place a short-term curfew over the holidays to discourage the spread of the coronavirus. Broward County officials said last week that businesses would have to shut down from midnight to 5 a.m. over the holidays – with the exception of Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, when the curfew starts an hour later. “Christmas and New Year’s holidays are known for large gatherings,” Broward Mayor Steve Geller told mayors during a conference call. “We are expecting a spike in cases here.” The temporary curfew, from Christmas to Jan. 4, is meant to stop people from moving around and gathering for parties. Midnight Mass and travel to and from work are exempt, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. Miami-Dade County already has a curfew from midnight to 6 a.m. Key West, home to one of the nation’s most high-profile New Year’s Eve celebrations with its drop of a drag queen in a super-sized red high heel shoe, also has implemented a holiday curfew. Visitors and locals who are not working at an essential business must be home or in their hotel rooms or vacation rentals by 10:30 p.m. starting Thursday and ending at 6 a.m. Sunday. All nonessential businesses must close from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., according to the Miami Herald.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: With coronavirus infections spiking across the Sunbelt, the latest White House Coronavirus Task Force report warned that Georgia will soon see more fatalities as cases and hospitalizations climb. “This surge must be met with aggressive public mitigation inclusive of safe public options, like outdoor dining,” said the most recent report, dated Dec. 20. “And clear personal behavior change messages to ensure as many Americans as possible can survive to be immunized and protected from severe disease and fatalities over the ensuing weeks.” More than nine out of 10 Georgia counties have moderate to high rates of spread, and 83% of the state’s counties are in the red zone. The task force said Georgia ranked 26th, or in the middle nationally, for new cases, and 18th for test positivity. Two weeks ago, Georgia ranked 47th, or fifth-best out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, for new cases. In the previous week’s report, the state ranked 41st in new cases. Georgia’s worsening ranking appears to reflect not only a rise in infections but also the addition of cases detected by rapid antigen tests. The recent inclusion of antigen cases provides a clearer picture of Georgia’s status as more states add these “probable” cases to their official counts. But it’s unknown how many states still do not report antigen cases.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Roughly 20% of Honolulu’s 4,500 first responders have received the Moderna coronavirus vaccine, city officials said. Hiro Toiya, the city’s emergency management director, said that 936 first responders received their shots Tuesday and Wednesday. Honolulu Police Department officers represented 649 of the vaccines, 173 vaccines were given to firefighters with the Honolulu Fire Department and 114 vaccines were distributed to paramedics, emergency medical technicians and lifeguards with the Department of Emergency Services. Between 60% to 70% of first responders are expected to receive the voluntary coronavirus vaccine, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. “It’s the best Christmas present we could give to ourselves, to our island, to our state, to our country and to the world and this planet,” Mayor Kirk Caldwell said. “And the City and County of Honolulu has made a commitment to get all of its first responders vaccinated, if they want to be vaccinated.” Caldwell said he would not receive the vaccine with the state’s first responders. The mayor said he would wait his turn and stand in line with other seniors after his term runs out in a few weeks. Police Chief Susan Ballard, Fire Chief Manuel Neves and Emergency Services Director Jim Howe were were vaccinated last week.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Vaccinations for about 10,200 residents and staff at 75 Idaho long-term care facilities will begin Monday, officials said. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokeswoman Niki Forbing-Orr told the Idaho Press that most of Idaho’s 315 long-term care facilities will receive the vaccine from CVS Health Care and Walgreens through the Pharmacy Partnership organized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “What we have been hearing from residents is, ‘We just want our life back, we want our families to visit, to play cards with our friends,’ ” said Zendi Meharry, the director of clinical operations at Cascadia Healthcare, a group that runs several skilled nursing facilities in Idaho. Residents and workers at long-term care facilities are in the first group scheduled to get vaccines. That group also includes front-line health care workers. About 130,000 people are in that group.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new proposal filed earlier this month would allow state lawmakers to meet and vote remotely in emergency situations. Chicago Rep. Ann Williams and Sen. Robert Martwick, both Democrats, call it a launching point for discussions on how to meet going into 2021 amid the ongoing pandemic, according to a joint statement. The Legislature last met in person in May to approve a budget, taking social distancing measures. However, Martwick said he has a preexisting condition which puts his health at risk. Under the bill, members of the General Assembly could meet remotely for session and committees if a joint proclamation is made by the House speaker and Senate president. The plan calls for members of the public to be able to watch sessions and committee meetings in real time. “The intent of the legislation is to provide for the very rare circumstances where it is extremely dangerous or impossible to meet,” Williams said in a statement. “It’s clear that the Legislature operates most effectively in person, when we can all meet and interact with each other more easily.” Earlier this year, the Senate adopted rules that allowed lawmakers to participate remotely if there’s a quorum present. A similar plan failed in the House.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:A federal judge has denied a request from more than a dozen Indianapolis bars and nightclubs to overturn coronavirus restrictions they said disproportionately impact bars and other age-regulated establishments. In her ruling, U.S. Southern Indiana District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson acknowledged the difficulties bars are facing during the pandemic but said the bars involved in the lawsuit \"have not presented a legal basis\" to overturn the orders restricting business. Bar owners in their complaint filed in September alleged Marion County's public health orders unfairly restrict bars because of the age of their patrons and the products they sell. The complaint said the county has imposed stringent closure times despite capacity restrictions, adding that Marion County's coronavirus regulations are stricter than elsewhere in the state. Bar owners involved in the suit called the court's decision a \"disappointing setback\" but said they plan to file an appeal Monday.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: Commercial flights will resume at the Dubuque airport next month. Airport officials recently announced that American Airlines plans to restore service to the airport on Jan. 6. The airline suspended flights out of Dubuque in October after cutting its flight schedule there several times in the spring as airline traffic plummeted because of the coronavirus pandemic. “The return of air service marks a significant milestone in the continued recovery from COVID-19,” said Molly Grover, CEO of the Dubuque Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A northeast Kansas county is moving jury trials to a building on its fairgrounds to allow for better social distancing amid the pandemic. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that the plan is for jury trials in Douglas County to resume Jan. 11 at the Flory Meeting Hall. Chief Judge James McCabria said the jury selection room can safely seat up to 30 people at a time in addition to the judge, parties and court staff. Trials that need larger jury pools will bring in panels at staged intervals. Because court proceedings will be livestreamed on YouTube for public access for the time being, prospective jurors will not be addressed by name, but by number. Trials will be held on the other side of the collapsible wall that divides the meeting hall in half. The space is large enough that the 14 chairs of the jury box can be distanced from one another. Witnesses who testify will wear plastic face shields instead of masks so that jurors can see their faces. “We believe anyone who participates in the process should feel safe with the distancing and other protocols that are in place,” said George Diepenbrock, a spokesperson for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Kentucky reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 14,999 new cases. That's down 24.6% from the previous week's total of 19,904. Kentucky ranked 24th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. In the latest week, the U.S. added 1,327,043 reported cases of coronavirus, a decrease of -12.3% from the week before. Across Kentucky, cases fell in 91 counties, with the best declines in Pulaski, Jefferson and Boone counties.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: Mayor Friday Ellis has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to city spokesperson Michelli Martin. In a statement, Martin said Ellis self-quarantined at the onset of symptoms late Tuesday night. His rapid test came back positive Wednesday afternoon. Ellis described his symptoms as mild, and close contacts have been notified. The mayor was at the Tuesday meeting of the City Council, and people considered close contacts at the meeting were also notified. Social distancing guidelines were adhered to Tuesday night and have been practiced by the City Council throughout the pandemic. Ellis urged citizens to continue mitigation efforts and thanked front-line workers for their “unwavering efforts to help residents fight this virus.” Council Chair Doug Harvey previously tested positive for the coronavirus and returned to council meetings Tuesday. Harvey expressed appreciation for everyone who checked on him while he was sick.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Schools across Maine are reporting dips in academic performance during the coronavirus pandemic. Standardized test scores in Gorham dropped by 10 percentage points or more in some subjects, and Biddeford High School reported a nine-point increase in course failure rate in year’s first quarter, the Portland Press Herald reported. The lower scores in Maine schools reflect broader trends across the country. Maine educators are looking for strategies to help get students back on track during a difficult time for learning. “It doesn’t come as a shock,” Biddeford High School Principal Martha Jacques said. “Obviously we’re disappointed and we want all kids to succeed, but we’ve also had a group of students that have been out of traditional education for six-plus months by the time they came back to school this fall and the nature of a hybrid model is very different than what they’re used to with an in-classroom model.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: With the pandemic aggravating mental health concerns, Sean Driscoll, a peer support specialist at the University of Maryland Medical Center’s Department of Psychiatry, said he focuses on steering people to resources that can help. “It’s OK to talk about your problems,” said Driscoll, who also writes songs to raise awareness about mental health issues under his stage name, Driscoe. “It’s OK to confide in people and to trust, and it’s OK to feel.” With COVID-19 cases surging and a difficult winter expected, state and local officials as well as health care professionals are taking steps to raise awareness about getting help during a time of rising mental health concerns, particularly during the holiday season when the problem can become more acute. Dr. David Marcozzi, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who is a senior medical advisor for COVID-19 to Gov. Larry Hogan, heightened attention on mental health during the pandemic when he spoke about the suicide of a longtime friend during a news conference last month. “Let’s make sure we reach out,” he said. “Let’s make sure we support each other and talk to a professional if helpful.” Maryland has seen a 30% increase in calls so far this year to the state’s 211 crisis hotline, said Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, who chairs a state commission on mental health. The lieutenant governor has been leading the panel since early last year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: New restrictions designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus took effect in the state on Saturday. The new rules state that most industries in Massachusetts are now subject to a 25% capacity limit. The new restrictions apply to restaurants, casinos, office spaces, houses of worship, retail businesses, libraries and many other kinds of businesses and public spaces. Indoor gatherings are also now limited to 10 people at private homes, public places and events. The administration of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker also said all hospitals are directed to postpone or cancel all nonessential inpatient elective invasive procedures. That restriction is intended to increase capacity at the hospitals.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Bridget McCormack wants judges and other court staff to be among the second wave of people to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the state, saying vaccinating them quickly would keep courts open and slow the spread of the virus. McCormack made the request in a Dec. 8 letter to Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief deputy director of the Department of Health and Human Services. McCormack asked that judges and court workers who are still performing work in person at Michigan’s courthouses be among the “essential workers” to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the second tier of vaccinations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has identified “workers supporting the operations of the judicial system, including judges, lawyers, and others providing legal assistance” as essential critical infrastructure workers, she noted. Michigan health officials expect to receive 120,900 doses of COVID-19 vaccines during each of the next two weeks. The FDA has authorized vaccines from pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna for emergency use.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Minnesota reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 11,910 new cases. That's down 38.1% from the previous week's total of 19,237. Minnesota ranked 43rd among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. Sunday's report included 2,335 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 40 new deaths, including one in the tri-county area. Stearns County added 57 new cases Sunday and reported one death of a resident in their late 80s, Benton County added 16 cases and Sherburne County added 47 cases. Across Minnesota, cases fell in 83 counties, with the largest declines in Hennepin, Ramsey and Dakota counties.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Mayor Andrew “Fofo” Gilich told WLOX-TV this week that he’s “about 80%” sure he will cancel Mardi Gras parades in Biloxi in 2021 because of concerns about the coronavirus. “Right now, it’s not looking too promising,” he said. Gilich said he will make a call on the event before the new year. “We aren’t going to do another super-spreader event,” he said, noting that health professionals have attributed some of the current increase in cases to larger gatherings around Thanksgiving. One of the Mississippi Gulf Coast’s largest Mardi Gras parades is hosted by the St. Paul Carnival Association and is among those that have cancel for 2021. Also canceled is the North Bay Mardi Gras parade, which usually takes place in St. Martin and D’Iberville. The Krewe of Nereids and the cities of Bay St. Louis and Waveland announced earlier this month they were canceling the Nereids’ Parade. Biloxi’s Second Liners Marching Club also announced it would not hold its annual parade. “You’ve got until the 16th, and that’s when the parades will roll, and I just don’t see a trend where we’re below 1,000 hospitalizations in that number of days,” Gilich told WLOX. “I don’t think it’s going to break anyone’s heart that we would rather be safe than sorry.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Missouri set a record for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on Christmas Day as the pandemic surges. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that there were 2,862 patients hospitalized statewide, eclipsing the record of 2,851 set on Nov. 18. Hospitalizations have remained high in the past month. Meanwhile, the seven-day average for new cases is 2,213 each day, according to data posted Saturday on the state health department website. With the virus present at such elevated levels, county officials are urging caution. “It is here, it is spread in the community, and we’ve got to make sure that that spread slows,” said St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern. “Our fates are in our own hands, and really, it’s not difficult to wear that mask.”\n\nMontana\n\nWolf Point: In a typical year, Native American youth die by suicide at nearly twice the rate of their white peers in the U.S. Mental health experts worry that the isolation and shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could make things worse. “It has put a really heavy spirit on them, being isolated and depressed and at home with nothing to do,” said Carrie Manning, a project coordinator at the Fort Peck Tribes’ Spotted Bull Recovery Resource Center. It’s not known what connection the pandemic has to the youth suicides on the Fort Peck reservation. Tribal members typically lean on one another in times of crisis, but this time is different. The reservation is a COVID-19 hot spot. In remote Roosevelt County, which encompasses most of the reservation, more than 10% of the population has been infected with the coronavirus. The resulting social distancing has led tribal officials to worry the community will fail to see warning signs among at-risk youth. So tribal officials are focusing their suicide prevention efforts on finding ways to help those youth remotely. “Our people have been through hardships and they’re still here, and they’ll still be here after this one as well,” said Don Wetzel, tribal liaison for the Montana Office of Public Instruction and a member of the Blackfeet Nation. “I think if you want to look at resiliency in this country, you look at our Native Americans.”\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Officials in central Nebraska are worried that next spring’s sandhill crane viewing season will be disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic just like this year’s was and hurt the area’s economy. The annual migration of sandhill cranes across central Nebraska usually draws thousands of visitors to the area who want to see the birds gather along the Platte River in the midst of their annual migration. Kearney Visitor Bureau Executive Director Roger Jasnoch told the Kearney Hub that there is little demand for the hotel rooms in the area that visitors usually fill. And the conferences, weddings and other events that help generate business for hotels and event centers have also disappeared. Jasnoch said the area is “still losing events as far out as next June. The first quarter (of 2021 business) has evaporated.” The pandemic has taken a toll on tourism in the area. Jasnoch said that revenue from lodging and occupation taxes is down 30% from July 1 to December, reflecting the drop in demand. Before the pandemic began, the 2019 crane viewing season was disrupted by significant flooding in the area, so next year could be the third year in a row of problems during the crane migration.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Unemployed Nevada residents were bracing for the end of some federal coronavirus relief benefits on Saturday. The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs were set to expire after President Donald Trump held off on signing a stimulus package presented to him by Congress. The new package would have extended the benefits for at least 11 more weeks for gig workers, self-employed people and those who have exhausted their regular unemployment claims.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Most of the recent confirmed cases of the coronavirus in New Hampshire are in Rockingham and Hillsborough counties, the state Department of Health and Human Services said. The department reported more than 1,000 new positive test results for the coronavirus on Saturday. “Community-based transmission continues to occur in the State and has been identified in all counties,” the department said in a statement. “Of those with complete risk information, most of the cases are either associated with an outbreak setting or have had close contact with a person with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Beginning this week, United Airlines travelers to Newark Liberty International Airport from the United Kingdom will have to show a negative coronavirus test. Gov. Phil Murphy and United Airlines announced Thursday that the restriction take effect Monday. United travelers with flights originating in the U.K. will have to present proof of a negative test obtained within 72 hours of departure. The restriction doesn’t apply to travelers originating from outside the U.K. who connect to a Newark-bound flight at London's Heathrow Airport. Passengers can take a same-day, rapid test at Heathrow. The measure is being taken to curb the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus that has surfaced in the U.K. “As we continue to experience a second wave of COVID-19 cases, it’s critical that we take any and all precautions to mitigate the potential for further transmission,” Murphy said in a statement. United said it is operating four daily flights this month from Heathrow to Chicago, Newark, Washington and San Francisco. Next month, it will operate two daily flights to Newark and Chicago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico has begun providing COVID-19 vaccinations to 15,000 people who work or live at long-term care facilities, state officials said. Beginning Sunday, the CVS and Walgreens pharmacy chains and Vida Pharmacy in Albuquerque administered doses of the Moderna vaccine at nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the state, officials said. “Sunday marks a monumental day in our fight with this deadly pandemic. It signifies a step toward protecting our seniors and securing their safety,” said Katrina Hotrum-Lopez, cabinet secretary of the Aging and Long-Term Services Department. The statement noted that people receiving vaccinations will need two doses from the same manufacturer administered several weeks apart. The pharmacies will send staff to facilities three times over the coming months to administer the vaccines. Dr. Tracie Collins, Department of Health cabinet secretary, said people who have been vaccinated can still carry and transmit COVID-19, so it’s important that they continue to wear masks and take other precautions such as washing their hands and distancing.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State police and health officials were investigating Saturday whether an Orange County health care provider violated state guidelines in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a statement that his office and state police were investigating Parcare Community Health Network in Orange County. Zucker said he received reports that Parcare might have fraudulently obtained the vaccine and diverted it to other facilities to be given to members of the public. The state has prioritized front-line health care workers, long-term care residents and staffers to receive the vaccine first. The first vaccine in the state was given to a critical care nurse in Queens on Dec. 14. “We take this very seriously and DOH will be assisting State Police in a criminal investigation into this matter,” Zucker said. “Anyone found to have knowingly participated in this scheme will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Parcare lists four locations in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and one in Monroe, Orange County on its website. In an emailed statement, the company said it would cooperate with the investigation and that it “has a long history of partnering with the city of New York to provide vital healthcare services to New Yorkers who need them most – including providing COVID-19 testing – especially for New Yorkers in medically underserved communities who’ve been hardest hit by COVID-19.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A North Carolina health care system said it is delaying COVID-19 vaccinations scheduled for next month after a controversy arose over who would get the initial round of doses. Atrium Health said up to 97 vaccination appointments set for January have been canceled, The Charlotte Observer reported. The action followed a report by several Charlotte television stations which cited a tweet by Atrium social media manager Katie McKiever saying she had scheduled her first vaccine appointment for early January. According to guidance published in October, health care workers and medical first responders should get the vaccine first. “The key is to get those most at risk and those who are on the frontlines risking their lives for the community. We get the vaccine to them so they can care for those who need it as others are waiting,” said Dr. Scott Rissmiller, Atrium’s executive vice president and chief physician executive. Atrium also said it has revised its internal plan for vaccine distribution to exclude nonfront-line health care workers from the first phase.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The North Dakota Army National Guard on Saturday began providing rapid coronavirus testing to people arriving at Hector International Airport in Fargo. The tests were being offered for free to people on arriving flights to catch new infections from spreading in the community. The tests are expected to take 15 minutes to give a result. Over the last two weeks, North Dakota has seen a 68% decline in the average number of new cases reported each day. An average of about 199 new cases was reported each day over the last week. The Department of Health reported 133 people had tested positive during testing completed Friday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Another 5,857 Ohioans have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Ohio Department of Health data recorded Sunday. That number is well below the three-week average of 9,310 cases a day, but weekend numbers generally fall off. Sunday's cases bring the statewide total to 670,525 since the pandemic began. Another 33 deaths were recorded on Sunday, also below the three-week daily average of 74. Total deaths in Ohio stand at 8,509. The number of hospitalizations rose by 273 on Sunday, which is less than the three-week average of 360. Total hospitalizations have reached 36,786. The state reported 30 additional intensive-care admissions on Sunday; the latest three-week average for ICU admissions is 39 people a day.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health authorities have reported more than 2,600 news cases of COVID-19 over the last two days as well as 13 more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The State Department of Health said the new counts from Saturday and Sunday bring the state totals to 279,139 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,370 fatalities. There were 2,458 new cases Saturday and 173 cases Sunday, according to the department. The 13 new deaths were reported Sunday. Over the last seven days, more than 15% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland:The Department of Agriculture said among animals captured during wildlife surveillance recent tests confirmed mink at a farm that tested positive for the coronavirus in late November are now clear of the virus. KOIN reported the department conducted two rounds of follow-up tests, 14 days apart, to document the animals’ recovery. The first follow-up testing occurred on Dec. 7, with only one of 62 animals testing positive for barely detectable levels of the virus. With the second round of testing on Dec. 21, there were no signs of the virus among all 62 tested, indicating the mink population on the farm had recovered. One more round of testing will be conducted before releasing the quarantine, per federal guidelines. Scientists with USDA Wildlife Services, under the direction of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, are continuing to conduct wildlife surveillance near the farm, which entails trapping and testing animals.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWashington Crossing: Washington Crossing Historic Park said it filmed an annual reenactment of George Washington’s crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas morning earlier this month because of the pandemic. A video of the reenactment is available online at YouTube. The Park said the reenactment provided a “close-up view” of the event it called “a beloved community tradition that will continue for years to come.” Crowd-size restrictions barred holding the Revolutionary War reenactment in the “traditional, in-person manner,” organizers said. Usually, thousands gather every Christmas morning on the banks of the river in Washington Crossing and Titusville, New Jersey, to watch historical reenactors set out in boats to retrace the daring 1776 voyage of Washington and his troops. Last year, the crossing was completed for the first time in three years with what the Friends of Washington Crossing Park said was probably a record crowd of 4,500 to 5,000 looking on. The crossing had been scuttled during the previous two years, first by high wind and then by high water levels. Other activities at the annual event include Washington’s address to his troops, historical speeches and processions, and staff in period clothing providing public interpretation. In the original crossing, boats ferried 2,400 soldiers, 200 horses and 18 cannons across the river. Washington’s troops marched 8 miles downriver before battling Hessian mercenaries in the streets of Trenton. Thirty Hessians were killed, and two Continental soldiers froze to death on the march.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has awarded the Rhode Island Department of Health more than $3 million to help with expenses that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic. The federal agency said the money was provided “for various supplies which included personal protective equipment, mortuary-related supplies for the state’s five refrigerated trucks and supplies for contracted personnel to assist with staging and relocation of hospitalized COVID-positive elderly patients statewide.” Regional administrator and federal coordinating officer Capt. Russ Webster said FEMA plans to keep helping Rhode Island “meet its long-term goals to recover stronger, safer and smarter.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Teacher vacancies in South Carolina are up 26% compared to last year, according to a new study. The findings lead teacher advocates and public education officials to say the coronavirus pandemic is worsening the state’s teacher shortage. The State newspaper reported that school districts counted 699 teaching and service position vacancies at the start of this school year compared to 555 at the beginning of the prior academic year. The findings come from an annual report by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention and Advancement. Education officials said vacancies can lead to larger class sizes, more classes taught by long-term substitutes, and some specialized classes not being offered. Advocates also said the teacher exodus could mean problems for the state’s long-term recruitment and retention of teachers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Wildlife officials said South Dakota’s outdoor recreation economy boomed in 2020, providing much-needed sales in several business sectors, as well as hopes of reversing a long-term decline in the number of licensed hunters and anglers. The state waived entry fees and did not collect visitor information for almost two months at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Even so, state park visitation in 2020 has been roughly 31% higher than it was in 2019, said Al Nedved, deputy director of the South Dakota Game Fish and Parks Department’s parks division. “It was pretty evident early on that the outdoors were going to be a place where people could exercise or just relax or whatever they like to do and do it safely,” Nedved said. For the first time in several years, hunting and fishing license sales to state residents increased in South Dakota. Together, resident hunting and fishing license sales rose 6.7%, and roughly one-quarter of 2020 licenses were sold to hunters or anglers who had not bought a license since at least 2017, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported. Meanwhile, classes on everything from archery to plant identification have been filling up quickly when staff at the Game, Fish & Parks Department Outdoor Campus in Sioux Falls post them online, said campus director David Parker.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The Tennessee Department of Health reported two days worth of coronavirus data on Saturday after not releasing data on Christmas. In those 48 hours, there were 14,395 cases, 9,230 of which were attributed to Friday's case count and 5,165 for Saturday's. To date, there have been 560,892 cases of the coronavirus reported in the state. So far, 5.48 million tests have been given. Tennessee confirmed 12 new deaths, five of which were attributed to Friday's case count and seven for Saturday's. In all, 6,443 people have died as a result of the virus.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Dennis Bonnen, the outgoing speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, said Sunday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus following his wife becoming sick last week. Bonnen wrote on his Facebook page that he was diagnosed over the weekend. The Republican said his symptoms have so far been mild and that his family is in quarantine. Bonnen said his family celebrated Christmas alone out of concern of spreading the virus and that it’s unknown how they were initially exposed. Bonnen’s positive test comes as coronavirus hospitalizations are hovering near their summer peak in Texas, even amid holiday gatherings and travel that health officials have warned are likely to further spread the virus. “This disease is no joke in its unpredictability and severity, so please continue to keep your guard up and your loved ones protected,” Bonnen wrote.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Utah reported fewer new coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 15,108 new cases. That's down 11.9% from the previous week's total of 17,149. Testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. Labs and testing sites closed. People traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. Some counties and states didn't report data as quickly. Across Utah, cases fell in six counties, with the best declines in Salt Lake, Utah and Davis counties.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermonters can now follow the progress of the state’s efforts to vaccinate the population against the virus that causes COVID-19 on a new dashboard on the website of the Health Department. The dashboard, which went live Wednesday, will provide information on the number of people who have been vaccinated and how many people have completed the two-shot series of vaccines needed to have immunity against the virus. It will also show the rates of vaccination by age, sex, race and ethnicity. As of Thursday, just under 4,400 people had received the first dose of one of the two vaccines being administered in Vermont. The state expects to receive a total of about 34,000 doses of vaccine by the new year. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said that initially, the dashboard will be updated weekly, on Wednesdays, but as progress is made in the state’s vaccination campaign, it could be updated more frequently.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: New figures from the Department of Corrections showed that two inmates and one staff member who tested positive for the coronavirus have died in recent days. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the figures posted Friday showed that overall, 41 inmates and two staff members who had tested positive have died. That’s up from Dec. 21, when the department said were 39 inmates and one staff member who had died. The department did not immediately release details about the recent deaths. There are about 25,000 inmates in Virginia and the department has about 11,000 staff members. About 7,000 inmates have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said last week he will extend a state ban on evictions to March 31. Inslee’s office did not offer more details on the moratorium extension, saying that more information would be available this week. “COVID-19 has had a significant financial impact on Washingtonians over the last nine months,” Inslee said in a statement. “I know this moratorium has been critical for many families and individuals as they cope with the impacts of this virus. People need certainty about whether the moratorium will be extended, and it is important that I provide that certainty today while we work out the final details of the moratorium.” Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan also extended the city’s eviction moratorium through March 31.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice reported that nearly half of his state’s stock of COVID-19 vaccines has been administered. But the promising news was tempered by the governor’s announcement on Christmas Day that 55 more West Virginians had died from the disease. During a press briefing Friday, the governor described, one by one, the latest people who had succumbed to the pandemic. “Not good, not good,” he said. By Saturday, that number had climbed further – with deaths now surpassing 1,250, according to state health officials. Earlier in the week, Justice said he expects West Virginia to complete within three weeks all vaccinations at hospitals, health departments and long-term care facilities. During his Christmas Day announcement, the governor reported that the state’s vaccination rate, about 47%, was the highest of any state. He said 28,623 of the 60,875 total doses delivered to West Virginia to date have been administered.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Officials said Dane County has secured a six-month extension of a program linking local growers with food pantries that was set to expire at the end of this year. The program began in April with the help of about $8 million of the county’s federal coronavirus relief funding. More than 4,000 hours of service have been logged to help those experiencing hardship and hunger, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. County Executive Joe Parisi said last week that a $5 million agreement has been reached with Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin to continue the program through at least the end of July. Many people facing job losses have turned to food pantries for meals. Requests for food from Second Harvest has increased more than 50% since last year, the nonprofit’s leader said last month.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Health care workers at Cody Regional Health have been challenged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been struggles with obtaining masks and other protective equipment, workers getting sick, and rising numbers and longer stays in the intensive care unit. They have pushed through them all. “The things the employees have done here and the department leaders to care for the patients of this community, everybody has just gone above and beyond,” chief clinical officer Keith Ungrund told The Cody Enterprise. Ungrund said the hospital has had 10 to 15 people out per week because they contracted the virus or were in close contact with another person who did. That crunch on staffing has led to occasional cancellations of elective surgeries – those procedures that aren’t immediately life-threatening but must still be done. The staffing challenges have also meant some health care workers are being cross-trained to ensure there is coverage in the ICU. It has been a total team effort, Ungrund said. And despite a recent push for longer hours and more overtime to have the people they need in the building, morale isn’t lacking. “They are a strong team of caregivers that take care of each other very well,” said Barbara Mullaney, a nurse and the head of the acute and critical care units. “We ensure that we are rounding on them routinely to ensure they are getting breaks and they have what they need. We are so proud of our team and they are doing their best to stay upbeat and positive.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/new-jersey/2024/12/15/nj-drones-news-updates/76989082007/", "title": "Drones over New Jersey have locals on alert. See all info we gathered", "text": "NorthJersey.com\n\nDec. 15, 2024 Updated Dec. 17, 2024, 12:46 a.m. ET\n\nPeople are seeing things. Blinking lights. Alone, in groups. Moving fast, moving around. In the night skies over New Jersey. For nearly a month now. Sometimes, the lights go off. At least, that what some people think they see.\n\nAre they drones, as many residents suspect? Are they manned commercial aircraft mistaken for drones, as federal officials say? New Jersey does have some of the busiest air space in the country. There’s Newark Liberty, JFK, LaGuardia. Dozens of small private jets zoom in and out of Teterboro and Morristown airports daily.\n\nOr are they drones being released from an Iranian mothership off the Jersey Shore — as one New Jersey congressman suggested?\n\nStory continues below photo gallery\n\nThe sightings occur only at night. And they haven’t dissipated. The mystery has understandably rattled some residents, sparked a Facebook page of folks who want to solve the case, prompted a North Jersey brewery to issue a new amber ale named Drone’s Ascent, and forced the FBI to investigate, the Pentagon to weigh in, Congress to hold a hearing and the White House to issue a statement.\n\nIt sounds like the plot of some wild Netflix series.\n\nNorthJersey.com and the Daily Record have covered the mystery’s every twist and turn, talked to experts, explored the impact of social media and optical illusions, as well as the types of drones commercially available and how they are used, not to mention the long history of strange occurrences in the Garden State.\n\nWe’ve posted dozens of stories since Nov. 19, and now, we’ve brought them all here in one place for you. Here's our complete coverage of North Jersey's drone saga, including a timeline and interactive map.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy confirmed Monday afternoon that three systems have made their way to the Garden State to monitor any nighttime activity in the airspace.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, who canceled a trip to Morris County, said: \"The government knows what is happening. Our military knows where they took off from. If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage. They know where it came from and where it went, and for some reason they don't want to comment.\"\n\nReports of drones flying over New Jersey at night have sparked safety and privacy concerns, but experts suggest that many sightings may not involve drones at all. To help reduce confusion, several apps allow users to identify aircraft in real time. The apps use a combination of data from aircraft transmissions, satellites and ground stations to display a map of air traffic in a given area.\n\nIntroduced in the 1990s by Canadian journalist Serge Monast, Project Blue Beam claims global elites will destabilize society by staging and unleashing massive supernatural events — alien invasions, holographic displays of cultural and religious figures, mind-control and faked crises — and capitalize on the hysteria to implement a new world order.\n\nThe FBI said it has compared the flight patterns of the region's three major commercial airports — Newark Liberty, JFK and LaGuardia — to the locations of reported drone sightings, and they match up in most cases. So most sightings of aircraft were mistaken for drones.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump pushed for the government to release information about the reported drone sightings in a post on Truth Social early Friday evening. \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!,\" Trump posted.\n\nThe Pequannock Township Police Department, Morris County Sheriff’s Office, and Morris County Prosecutor’s Office responded to the scene to assess the situation. Investigators determined the device was a hobby or toy drone, not a commercial or military-grade model.\n\nIn recent years, drones have become increasingly popular amongst the general public across various hobbies and industries from filmmaking and photography to real estate, construction, emergency response, disaster relief and more.\n\nThe ongoing reports of alleged drones flying over New Jersey nightly earned the bizarre phenomenon a spot on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" Thursday night.\n\nHere's NorthJersey.com's timeline of purported drone-related events from the initial sightings and county investigations to the most recent statements released by law enforcement, state and federal officials.\n\nHow do you tell the difference between a drone and a plane? Or, this weekend are you seeing one of the strongest, brightest and most active meteor showers of the year: the Geminid? Here's everything you need to know and watch for.\n\nIt appears that statements from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House have done little to dissuade New Jersey residents from taking to social media to report and discuss the alleged drones that have been reportedly hovering in the night sky in recent weeks.\n\nA drone was used by first responders to look through brush under high tension electrical towers for reported remnants of a drone that supposedly crashed last night, adjacent to a Lowe’s parking lot on Rt 206 in Hillsborough.\n\nNJ has hosted steered flying objects in its skies since 1863. For generations, New Jersey has played host to stories of the strange and the surreal, including Martian invasions and ghostly treasure guardians.\n\n\"This is not the work of a backyard hobbyist,\" Congressman Jeff Van Drew (R-District 2) said in an over four-minute video posted to his YouTube account. He said his information comes from \"high-level, credible sources.\" \"Drones are flying into the United State air space. Coming in and out of international waters,\" said Van Drew, claiming that drones are avoiding our radar and being \"expertly piloted.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that reported drone sightings in New Jersey pose a national security or public safety threat, White House national security communications advisor John Kirby said on Thursday.\n\nIn addition to spooking people who spotted them buzzing and blinking through the New Jersey night sky over the past month, supposed sightings of mysterious unmanned drones have made the state’s political leaders edgy. They find themselves in the last place they want to be: unable to provide a reassuring answer to a perplexed public.\n\nGov. Murphy, enough is enough. It’s time to come clean on the drones. Rightly or wrongly, speculation has reached a fever pitch in New Jersey. Social media and cable news are aflame with reports of drones over military bases and sightings over reservoirs, car-sized drones, truck-sized drones, “Iranian motherships” full of drones. It's time to take a page from your early COVID days and hold a televised news conference with the experts\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), who represents much of the county where New Jersey's drone mystery began, has joined a chorus of Congress members demanding federal intervention to ground the unidentified evening flights that have caused anxiety, panic and rampant speculation.\n\nWeeks of alleged drone sightings in New Jersey has seemingly left residents with more questions than answers. That includes a lack of answers provided by the FBI, who are currently investigating the drone sighting and assisting local law enforcement in their investigation as well.\n\nOn Fox News Wednesday morning, Congressman Jeff Van Drew said, \"Iran launched a mothership probably about a month ago that contains these drones. That mothership, I'm going to tell you the deal, it's off the East Coast of the United States of America. They've launched drones.\"\n\nTens of thousands of online amateur sleuths have set social media ablaze as they race to find the source of mysterious drones that have reportedly amassed New Jersey skies in recent weeks. The Facebook group \"New Jersey Drones — let's solve it.\" has quickly garnered membership.\n\n\"Drone\" is a loaded word. It has unsettling associations with the military, with the insect kingdom, with some bad human traits. If it hasn't added to the present tension, it certainly hasn't helped to ease it.\n\nPolice in Morris County dispelled rumors of an alleged drone sighting in the area Tuesday night, saying the scene was the result of damage from a car crash.\n\nDiamond Spring Brewing Company in Denville officially announced its newest beer, Drone's Descent, in social media posts. The amber ale was inspired by what the brewery cheekily called \"recent events.\"\n\nMine Hill Mayor Sam Morris shot video of what he believes to be drones above his Morris County town on Dec. 4. Take a look.\n\nPicatinny, where some of the initial reports of unusual drone activity began last month, has recorded 11 confirmed sightings over the facility since Nov. 13 and seven reports that either could not confirmed or turned out to be airplanes, Lt. Col. Craig Bonham II said in a news release. \"While the source and cause of these aircraft operating in our area remain unknown, we can confirm that they are not the result of any Picatinny Arsenal-related activities,” he said.\n\nHow many of these sightings are mistakes? Could some of the drone-mania that has gripped the state over the last few weeks be due to simple errors of vision, mistaken identity, optical illusion? And if this is all some kind of vast, clandestine surveillance operation — as some suggested — why do these things fly only at night? And why would they make themselves so easily seen with those flashing lights?\n\nIn the midst of mysterious drone sightings that have blanketed New Jersey in recent weeks, Rep. Josh Gottheimer has introduced federal legislation to allow state and local law enforcement to monitor and be \"regularly on top of\" drone use in the future.\n\nAt a hearing, U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzalez (R-Texas), asked, \"You're telling me we don't know what the hell these drones in New Jersey are?\" Robert Wheeler Jr., assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group for the FBI, replied, \"That's correct.\" Gonzalez said, \"That's crazy. That's madness.\"\n\nSen. Doug Steinhardt sent a letter to state Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Senate President Nicholas Scutari on Friday, calling on them to take action by convening a bipartisan panel to address the situation. And Assemblymen John DiMaio and Erik Peterson sent a letter to Gov. Phil Murphy, calling on him to \"take immediate action and address growing concerns over unexplained drone activity.\"\n\nMysterious drones that have taken to New Jersey skies for weeks are sophisticated enough to \"go dark\" once they are spotted, Gov. Phil Murphy said. \"This is something we're taking deadly seriously,\" Murphy said over the rising fears among some residents, adding that while there has been \"good cooperation out of the feds,\" he is pleading for more.\n\nMorris County mayors and other local elected officials are demanding answers and action by authorities concerning the multiple sightings of drones in North Jersey. A letter signed by 19 elected officials says agencies have taken “a reactive instead of proactive approach” to the issue.\n\nWhere's the frenzy coming from? Many North Jersey residents are looking at the sky and seeing lights that sincerely unnerve them. But psychologists and social scientists say there are other factors that have to be taken into account: our human tendencies to follow a crowd and social media's ability to amplify fears and narratives.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy convened a briefing with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, and New Jersey State Police to discuss the situation. Members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation also participated.\n\nReported sightings of the unusual activity have been seen as far west as High Point Monument in Sussex County and across North Jersey toward Garfield in Bergen County. In Central Jersey, many residents have reported suspicious activity in the skies from as far south as Delaware Township in Hunterdon County and west across Somerset County.\n\nFrom the everyday flying toy to a hobbyist's $300 drone or a professional's $10,000 quadcopter to the military's own remotely piloted aircraft drones, worth well over $56 million each, let's take a look at what may just be those bright, \"car-sized\" objects that appear to rise in the skies as the sun sets.\n\nThe latest reports are emerging out of Sussex County, with multiple users in a Sparta Facebook group alleging they saw drones flying through the town. The FBI reported that it was investigating a \"possible fixed-wing aircraft\" flying along the Raritan River.\n\nNorthJersey.com asked two of its own multimedia journalists, both with extensive experience piloting drones, what they think of the situation. Contrary to the prevailing opinions across social media, they are skeptical that what they are seeing are, in fact, drones.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued temporary flight restrictions last month prohibiting drone flights over Trump National and the Picatinny Arsenal military research and manufacturing facility in Morris County. The move came \"at the request of federal security partners,\" the FAA said.\n\n\"I could see five of them\" on Sunday night from the backyard, said Jonelle Ferentinos, who lives less than a mile west of the reservoir in the Lake Intervale section of Parsippany. \"It was dark, so I really couldn't see where they were coming from or going to. They just seemed to be flying around.\"\n\nRecent drone sightings have also been reported in Warren County, according to Warren County Community College President William Austin, who also teaches drone piloting at the school. Austin, who has been flying drones for a decade, said he believes that because most drones contain a GPS identification chip, \"It's just a matter of time before someone figures out who it is. It's like flying with LoJack.\"\n\nVarious law enforcement agencies in Morris County are investigating reports of drones seen in the area that prompted rumors on social media. The county prosecutor's office confirmed that officers on patrol observed drone activity, but there is no known threat to the public as a result of the sightings.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/02/21/coronavirus-preparations-new-jersey/4824089002/", "title": "Coronavirus: What NJ health officials have prepared if it spreads", "text": "Feb. 21, 2020 Updated Feb. 28, 2020, 5:10 p.m. ET\n\nA century ago, hundreds of acres in Bergen County — the site of a World War I embarkation camp — were declared a quarantine zone.

See his response 01:28 • Source: CNN Gorbachev was asked on Larry King how he wants history to judge him. See his response 01:28\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, wrote on Twitter that Gorbachev’s role in ending the Cold War “opened the way for a free Europe. This legacy is one we will not forget.”\n\nWith his outgoing, charismatic nature, Gorbachev broke the mold for Soviet leaders who until then had mostly been remote, icy figures. Almost from the start of his leadership, he strove for significant reforms, so the system would work more efficiently and more democratically. Hence the two key phrases of the Gorbachev era: “glasnost” (openness) and “perestroika” (restructuring).\n\n“I began these reforms and my guiding stars were freedom and democracy, without bloodshed. So the people would cease to be a herd led by a shepherd. They would become citizens,” he later said.\n\nHe will be buried next to his wife at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, RIA Novosti reported citing the Gorbachev Foundation.\n\nFrom farm labor to party’s rising star\n\nGorbachev had humble beginnings: He was born into a peasant family on March 2, 1931 near Stavropol, and as a boy, he did farm labor along with his studies, working with his father who was a combine harvester operator. In later life, Gorbachev said he was “particularly proud of my ability to detect a fault in the combine instantly, just by the sound of it.”\n\nHe became a member of the Communist Party in 1952 and completed a law degree at Moscow University in 1955. It was here that he met – and married – fellow student Raisa Titarenko.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Gorbachev became head of the agriculture department for the Stavropol region. By the end of the decade he had risen to the top of the party hierarchy in the region. He came to the attention of Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov, members of the Politburo, the principal policy-setting body of the Communist Part of the Soviet Union, who got him elected to the Central Committee in 1971 and arranged foreign trips for their rising star.\n\nIn 1978, Gorbachev was back in Moscow, and the next year he was chosen as a candidate member of the Politburo. His stewardship of Soviet agriculture was not a success. As he came to realize, the collective system was fundamentally flawed in more than one way.\n\nA full Politburo member since 1980, Gorbachev became more influential in 1982 when his mentor, Andropov, succeeded Leonid Brezhnev as general secretary of the party. He built a reputation as an enemy of corruption and inefficiency, finally rising to the top party spot in March 1985.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev, seen in 1984, when he was a Russian Politburo member and second in line at the Kremlin. Bryn Colton/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\n‘A man one can do business with’\n\nHoping to shift resources to the civilian sector of the Soviet economy, Gorbachev began to argue in favor of an end to the arms race with the West.\n\nHowever, throughout his six years in office, Gorbachev always seemed to be moving too fast for the party establishment – which saw its privileges threatened – and too slow for more radical reformers, who hoped to do away with the one-party state and the command economy.\n\nDesperately trying to stay in control of the reform process, he seemed to have underestimated the depth of the economic crisis. He also seemed to have had a blind spot for the power of the nationality issue: Glasnost created ever-louder calls for independence from the Baltics and other Soviet republics in the late 1980s.\n\nHe was successful in foreign policy, but primarily from an international perspective, with other world leaders taking note. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called him “a man one can do business with.”\n\nIn 1986, face to face with American President Ronald Reagan at a summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, Gorbachev made a stunning proposal: eliminate all long-range missiles held by the United States and the Soviet Union. It was the beginning of the end of the Cold War.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 “for his leading role in the peace process which today characterizes important parts of the international community.”\n\nThe pact that resulted, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, endured as a pillar of arms control for three decades until, in 2019, the United States formally withdrew and the Russian government said it had been consigned to the trash can.\n\nGorbachev speaks during a visit to Ottawa, Canada in 1990. Wojtek Laski/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nHard-liners revolt\n\nWhile Gorbachev’s arms control agreements with the US could be seen as also being in the Soviet interest, the breakaway of some of the countries of Eastern Europe, followed by German unification and NATO membership for the new unified Germany (West Germany had previously been in NATO), angered old-school Communists.\n\nIn August 1991, hard-liners had had enough. With Gorbachev on vacation in the Crimea, they staged a revolt. Boris Yeltsin, the president of the biggest Soviet republic – Russia – and a fierce critic of what he considered Gorbachev’s halfway reforms, nevertheless came to his rescue, facing down and defeating the coup plotters.\n\nBut across the Soviet Union, republics – one after another – were declaring independence and on December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president. As he read his resignation speech, Gorbachev defined what likely will be his legacy: “The country received freedom, was liberated politically and spiritually, and that was the most important achievement.”\n\nThe red flag that flew over the Kremlin, symbol of the USSR, was lowered. The Soviet Union – was over and Yeltsin was in control. “We are living in a new world,” Gorbachev said.\n\nIn April 2012, CNN’s Christiane Amanpour asked Gorbachev whether he had engineered the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nGorbachev said there had been nothing in his speeches “until the very end” that had supported its disintegration: “The breakup of the union was the result of betrayal by the Soviet nomenklatura, by the bureaucracy, and also Yeltsin’s betrayal. He spoke about cooperating with me, working with me on a new union treaty, he signed the draft union treaty, initialed that treaty. But at the same time, he was working behind my back.”\n\nIn 1996 Gorbachev ran against Yeltsin for the Russian presidency but got less than 1% of the vote.\n\nSpeaking out post-presidency\n\nThree years later, Gorbachev lost the love of his life – his wife of 46 years, Raisa – to cancer. The couple had one daughter, Irina. “In the worst moments I was always very calm and balanced. But now that she’s gone – I don’t want to live. The central point in our lives is gone,” he said.\n\nBut Gorbachev did go on, speaking out on nuclear disarmament, the environment, poverty – and in his wife’s memory, set up with the family the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation to fight children’s cancer.\n\nPreviously, he had established the Green Cross – to deal with ecological issues – and the International Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies, or Gorbachev Foundation. In 2011, Gorbachev also launched the annual “Gorbachev Awards” to celebrate “those who have changed the world for the better.”\n\nGorbachev’s involvement in Russian politics continued as well. He was head of the Social Democratic Party of Russia from 2001 until his resignation in 2004 over conflicts with party direction and leadership.\n\nIn 2007, he became head of a new Russian political movement – the Union of Social Democrats, which in turn set up the opposition Independent Democratic Party of Russia.\n\nHe told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in 2012 that he agreed Russian democracy was “alive” but added: “That it is ‘well’… not so. I am alive, but I can’t say that I’m fine.” He explained that the “institutions of democracy are not working efficiently in Russia, because ultimately they are not free.”\n\nMixed legacy\n\nIn an interview with CNN in 2019, Gorbachev said the US and Russia must strive to avoid a “New Cold War” developing despite worsening tensions. “This might turn out to be a hot war that could mean the destruction of our entire civilization. This must not be allowed,” he said.\n\nAnd asked about the demise of the 1987 treaty he signed with Reagan, Gorbachev expressed a hope that such arms control agreements could be revived.\n\n“All the agreements that are there are preserved and not destroyed,” he said. “But these are the first steps towards destruction of [that which] must not be destroyed in any case.” The ultimate goal of arms control, he added, must be to get rid of nuclear weapons completely.\n\nGorbachev’s legacy in the Baltics is also tarnished by his anti-Independence stance there. In 1991, as the push towards independence grew in the region, he ordered Soviet troops to crush demonstrations. A crackdown in January that year killed 14 people in Lithuania and five in Latvia.\n\nHis post-USSR life also included some surprises as he worked to raise money for his causes with appearances in advertisements for Pizza Hut and Louis Vuitton. In 2004 Gorbachev won a Grammy Award for best spoken word album for children for “Prokofiev: Peter and the Wolf / Beintus: Wolf Tracks,” which he recorded with former US President Bill Clinton and actress Sophia Loren.\n\nOther awards included the 2008 Liberty Medal from the US National Constitution Center and Russia’s highest honor, the Order of St. Andrew, which was given to him on his 80th birthday in 2011 by then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nBut to the end, Gorbachev was a leader more respected in other countries than at home. In Russia, he was reviled by some for destroying the Soviet empire and by others for moving too slowly in freeing his nation from the grip of communism. In the West, however, he remains the Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the Cold War.\n\nCorrection:\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that Gorbachev died at 91.", "authors": ["Susannah Cullinane Laura Smith-Spark", "Susannah Cullinane", "Laura Smith-Spark"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/entertainment/gallery/people-we-lost-2022", "title": "People we've lost in 2022 | CNN", "text": "1.

So, that eliminates all y’all leaving that hotel.\n\n“Because it ain’t happening until I give you further notice. So, whatever her name is, whoever she is, parents, everybody – they gonna come to the hotel and visit you because y’all ain’t leaving.”\n\nTakeoff was shot and killed early Tuesday in Houston.

And even looked up a little bit to try and get the lay of the land … I’m saying, ‘How did all that happen in just those few seconds?’ It didn’t make any sense. Like, I just don’t understand it.”\n\nHarris died just days before the 50th anniversary of the catch, and the Steelers had planned to retire his No. 32 jersey during halftime of their game against the Raiders on Saturday.\n\nThe NFL Network in 2019 named the Immaculate Reception the top play in the 100 years of the league.\n\nThe play was not without controversy: There were no convincing replays to determine who deflected the ball when two opposing players collided and whether the ball actually hit the ground when Harris caught it.\n\nIn the interview, Russo said some believe that the nose of the football hit the turf, “But you’re saying that’s not the case, correct?”\n\n“I have no idea, I have no idea,” Harris said. “I remember nothing. That’s what baffles me…”\n\nRusso noted Harris was “a long way away from where the ball ricocheted.” If another Steeler had touched the ball, Harris’ catch would not have been legal.\n\n“I have no recollection of seeing the ball at all,” Harris said. “I have no visual of the ball. I have no recollection. But look at … how fast it came back.”\n\nHarry Cabluck/AP\n\n‘You don’t practice stuff like this’\n\nLooking at the film, Harris says, “I’m thinking that it could only have been” Raiders defender Jack Tatum “that the ball bounced off of” before Harris made the shoestring catch. Tatum had collided with Steelers fullback Frenchy Fuqua.\n\nIn explaining how he made the play, Harris noted that he “always had great reflexes but you don’t practice stuff like this. … So it kind of blows my mind.”\n\nThe Steelers won the game 13-7 for the team’s first-ever playoff victory but lost their next game. Still, the team went on to dominate the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls.\n\nRusso, the host, opened the interview by asking, “How are you today, OK pal?” It was likely the last interview Harris did before his death was announced on Wednesday. His cause of death was not provided.\n\n“Doing great. Fantastic,” Harris said, though he was coughing here and there. “And, like as you said, 50 years ago, and, and it still feels brand new.”\n\nHarris then went on to talk about the game-winning drive, how it started off poorly and left the Steelers in a desperate spot.\n\n“So, things didn’t go too well on those first three plays, as you know. And then it gets down to fourth down. A long way to go. 22 seconds.\n\nAnd I go into the huddle and I tell myself, ‘Franco, this will probably be the last play of the season. It was a good season. Just play it till the end.’\n\nAnd (the coach) called that 66 halfback option.”\n\nHarris’ assignment was to stay in and block.\n\nHe recalled that “there wasn’t much … adrenaline” in the huddle.\n\nWe were winning the whole game and right at the end (the Raiders) scored. It seemed more of a letdown than anything.”\n\nHarris joined the Seattle Seahawks in 1984. Barry Sweet/AP\n\nRusso noted that Harris “did block well” on the play and noticed that quarterback Terry Bradshaw was scrambling under pressure from the defense.\n\n“My thought was to release to be an outlet pass,” Harris said. “And Bradshaw, being as, you know, big and as strong as he is, you know, guys trying to bring him down, he’s able to fight them off and get the ball into the air.”\n\nHarris said when the ball was in the air, “I tell myself, right, I tell myself ‘Go to the ball, go to the ball.’”\n\nHarris said that was his instinct because that was what he was taught as a running back in college, under Joe Paterno at Penn State University.\n\n“That’s what Joe preached to us all four years at Penn State. You know, always go to the ball … And so I start taking some steps to the ball and I remember nothing after that… which blows my mind, that I have no visual, no recollection of anything until I am stiff arming (Raiders defender) Jimmy Warren, going into the end zone.”\n\nSome old-time Raiders still salty\n\nHarris noted how important it was that he didn’t dive for the ball. In those days when a player hits the ground while possessing the ball, he was officially down and could not advance it.\n\n“How lucky am I that I was conscious that, you know, catch it that low without diving for it,” Harris said.\n\nHarris said that after the players collided and the ball deflected into the air, some of the Raiders started to clap and celebrate.\n\n“And the Raiders stop, just for a few seconds, and that few seconds that they stopped gave me the head start to get into the end zone.”\n\nAll these years later, when some old-time Raiders still assert that the catch wasn’t a legal catch, Harris says he pays it no mind.\n\n“As a matter of fact,” Harris said, “I feel good that they’re still sulking about that.”", "authors": ["David J.

You could argue that it is the very essence of the Memphis experience.\n\nWith the city celebrating its bicentennial, we decided to scan the history books and The Commercial Appeal archives to offer survey of some musical moments that are fondly remembered or meaningful in ways both large or small.\n\nThis is by no means a definitive list or a linear history of Memphis music, but rather a selection of important dates, events, songs, records, people and places that helped shape that story.\n\nHere are our 200 Memphis music moments:\n\n1. W.C. Handy, the father of “The Memphis Blues,” is born Nov. 16, 1873, in Florence, Alabama.\n\n2. 1877: Estimated birth year of Frank Stokes, regarded as the father of the \"Memphis blues\" guitar style. He started playing on Beale Street at the turn of the 20th century and his recordings with partner Dan Sane, as the Beale Street Sheiks, were among the most influential of the 1920s and '30s. With Sane, and on his own, Stokes cut nearly 40 sides for the Paramount and Victor labels. Stokes' work had a major impact on the era's biggest musical star, \"The Singing Brakeman\" Jimmie Rodgers.\n\n3. A pioneering figure in the world of gospel music, Lucie E. Campbell is born on April 30, 1885. A singer and composer, Campbell's songs would become staples of African American churches and were covered by country stars like Hank Snow, Johnny Cash and Ernest Tubb.\n\n4. The original Orpheum was built as the Hopkins Grand Opera House in 1890 and was renamed the Orpheum after it became part of that vaudeville circuit in 1907. It burned to the ground in 1923, and today's Orpheum was built on its footprint five years later. It was purchased and operated by Malco as a movie house until 1977, and reopened in its current incarnation in 1984.\n\n5. Born on March 6, 1893, guitarist and songwriter Furry Lewis was a famed blues storyteller. After recording a series of influential sides in the 1920s, Lewis fell into obscurity, working as a street sweeper in Memphis. He was “rediscovered” 40 years later, his career reinvigorated by the blues revival of the 1960s.\n\n6. Jazz pianist, composer and bandleader Lil Hardin is born in Memphis on Feb. 3, 1898. Hardin would go on to exert a profound influence in shaping the music and career of her husband, Louis Armstrong. Her songs would be covered by everyone from Ray Charles to Ringo Starr.\n\n7. Jazz saxophonist, swing-era bandleader and Memphis musical innovator Jimmie Lunceford is born in June 6, 1902.\n\n8. Born on Beale Street on Oct. 19, 1907, Nat D. Williams would become a major Memphis music figure without playing or singing a note. Williams was an influential figure as host of the Palace Theater’s famed Beale Street Amateur Night, as director of Booker T. Washington High School’s talent show, and as the first African American disc jockey in Memphis and a nationally renowned writer and journalist.\n\n9. One of the world's great pianists, John “Peter” Chatman — better known as Memphis Slim — is born in Memphis on Sept. 3, 1915.\n\n10. Sam Phillips — founder of the Memphis Recording Service and Sun Studio — is born Jan. 5, 1923, in Florence, Alabama.\n\n11. Led by Will Shade, the Memphis Jug Band forms in 1925. The group — in various iterations — will make some 60-plus recordings for Victor Records between 1927 and 1932. Their recordings would influence later generations of artists, including Bob Dylan, The Lovin' Spoonful and the Grateful Dead.\n\n12. Riley B. King is born Sept. 16, 1925, in Berclair, Mississippi, between Itta Bena and Indianola. The man who would become B.B. King is the great-grandson of a slave, and his childhood is filled with heartbreak. His younger brother died as an infant, his parents then separated and his mother died when he was 9. He was raised by his grandmother, who died during his teens.\n\n13. Influential radio disc jockey \"Daddy-O\" Dewey Phillips is born May 13, 1926, in Crump, Tennessee.\n\n14. Willie Mitchell — trumpeter, bandleader, record producer and architect of Hi Records — is born March 1, 1928, in Ashland, Mississippi.\n\n15. Koko Taylor was a Shelby County sharecropper's daughter whose regal bearing and powerful voice earned her the sobriquet \"Queen of the Blues.\" Born Cora Walton on Sept. 28, 1928, just outside Memphis, Taylor said her dream to become a blues singer was nurtured in the cotton fields outside her family's sharecropper shack. During her more than 40-year career, Taylor was nominated seven times for Grammy awards and won in 1984.\n\n16. Jim Stewart — founder of Satellite and Stax Records — is born July 29, 1929, in Middleton, Tennessee.\n\n17. Sonny Burgess is born in Newport, Arkansas, on May 28, 1929. Among the many greats who came through the doors of Sun Records in the 1950s, Burgess was universally regarded for both his musical skills and showmanship on stage. Burgess and his band The Pacers achieved rockabilly immortality with their earliest efforts for Sun — notably their 1956 debut single \"Red-Headed Woman\" backed with \"We Wanna Boogie,\" which remains one of the rawest and most electrifying releases in the label's history.\n\n18. In 1930 “The Singing Brakeman,” Jimmie Rodgers, releases “Blue Yodel #9,” a bit of bluesy braggadocio announcing his arrival in Memphis, as he strides the corner of Beale and Main streets.\n\n19. Born Robert Calvin Brooks on Jan. 27, 1930, in tiny Rosemark, Tennessee, the singer who would come to be known as Bobby \"Blue\" Bland moved to Memphis as a teenager with his mother. It was in the Bluff City that Bland began a career that would ultimately see him honored and enshrined in the halls of multiple musical institutions: the Blues Hall of Fame in 1981, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\n20. April 5, 1931: The birthday of “Cowboy\" Jack Clement in Memphis. Clement first made his mark as Sam Phillips' right-hand man at Sun Records. He would record Jerry Lee Lewis' biggest hits and pen several others for Johnny Cash, before becoming a major figure in country music.\n\n21. Musician, radio deejay and station owner, cult TV star, wrestling promoter, nightclub impresario and record label head Eddie Bond is born in South Memphis on July 1, 1933. A rockabilly star in the '50s, Bond gave early career boosts to everyone from guitar great Reggie Young — who began as a member of Bond's backing group the Stompers — to Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, who got their start as the house band at Bond's Diplomat Club. Bond earned his nickname as the \"Tennessee Legend Maker\" bringing the story of McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser to light and launching the career of wrestling royal Jerry \"The King\" Lawler.\n\n22. In tiny Brookings, Arkansas, guitarist and producer Roland Janes is born on Aug. 20, 1933. Janes was at Jerry Lee Lewis’ side during the Killer’s greatest triumphs in the ’50s, he served as the linchpin for the Sun house band, and he played a crucial role in the growth of garage music in the ’60s with his own Sonic studio. For the last 30 years of his life, until his death in 2012, he was resident engineer and producer at Sam Phillips Recording Service.\n\n23. His given name was John Henry Cannon, but the world knew him as Ace. One of Memphis' great instrumental hitmakers, a session man at Sun and a pillar of Hi Records, saxophonist Ace Cannon was born on May 5, 1934. Hailed as \"The Godfather of the Sax,\" Cannon cut 38 singles and 27 albums for South Memphis' Hi label during the 1960s and 1970s.

King, eventually becoming one of the leading saxophonists in jazz, working with Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock and others.\n\n26. In 1936, a concert venue in Overton Park was opened. The Orchestra Shell, as it was then known, was funded through a partnership between the federal Works Progress Administration, the Memphis Park Commission and the city of Memphis. As the opening day program noted, \"This Orchestra Shell, a pledge to the future of music in Memphis, will long repay the city for its construction in the pleasure its facilities will produce to the half million visitors who enjoy Overton Park each year.” The renamed and refurbished Levitt Shell at Overton Park continues to provide great music to Memphians in 2019.\n\n27. Lincoln “Chips” Moman is born on June 12, 1937, in Georgia. A gifted rockabilly guitarist and band leader in the 1950s, Moman went on to become one of the architects of Stax Records and author of some of the most enduring songs in the history of rhythm-and-blues and country music — from “Dark End of the Street” to “Luckenbach Texas (Back to the Basics of Love).” In addition to midwifing Elvis’ creative rebirth in 1969, Moman shaped Memphis’ American Sound Studios and its house band, generating the most prolific run of chart hits in history.\n\n28. On March 15, 1938, world-renowned jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd is born in South Memphis.

King to the Beach Boys.\n\n29. Born Alvertis Isbell on March 15, 1940, in Brinkley, Arkansas, Al Bell started his career as a disc jockey in high school, spinning records at sock hops.

On Dec. 19, 1941, Maurice White is born in South Memphis. He would ultimately move to Los Angeles, founding Earth, Wind & Fire, who became superstars in the 1970s, selling more than 90 million albums and creating classic hits like \"September,\" \"Shining Star\" and \"Boogie Wonderland.\" White died in 2016.\n\n33. Carla Thomas — the Queen of Stax Records and one of the pillars of the South Memphis soul label — is born Dec. 21, 1942.\n\n34. Elvis Presley makes his first public appearance, competing in a singing contest at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show in fall 1945.\n\n35. In November 1948, the teenage Elvis Presley moves to Memphis with his parents Vernon and Gladys Presley, eventually settling in the Lauderdale Courts housing project.\n\n36. In 1948, famed country duo The Louvin Brothers move to Memphis, where they perform regularly and appear on the radio. Among the Louvins' many ardent local fans are Gladys Presley and her young son, Elvis. Presley would later open shows for the Louvins in the mid-'50s.\n\n37. In 1949, Dewey Phillips will become the host of a radio show on WHBQ called \"Red, Hot and Blue.\" His willfully eclectic show — which mixed blues, country, R&B and dance records seamlessly — helped prepare Southern audiences for the coming wave of rock 'n' roll, a revolution that Phillips helped usher in.\n\n38. Guitarist Reggie Young moves with his family to Memphis in 1950 at the age of 14. A relative prodigy, Young was gigging professionally at age 15. He would go on to back local rockabilly singer Eddie Bond — putting his signature lick on Bond's hit \"Rockin' Daddy\" — before being hired away by country star Johnny Horton. In the late '50s Young would land as the house guitarist at South Memphis' fledgling Royal Studios/Hi Records, making hits with Bill Black's Combo, before going on to become part of the hit-making machine at American Sound Studios, and later the most in-demand session guitarist in Nashville.\n\n39. On March 27, 1952, Sam Phillips officially launches Sun Records in Memphis, where he will go on to discover and record Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins and other pivotal rock 'n' roll stars.\n\n40. In 1952, B.B. King scores his first hit record, the chart-topping R&B number “3 O’Clock Blues.” Over the next decade, King would release a steady stream of hit singles, helping him rise from the chitlin’ circuit to the pinnacle of black entertainment.\n\n41. In June 1953, Elvis Presley graduates from Humes High School.\n\n42. That summer Presley stops by the Memphis Recording Service, to record a demo of \"My Happiness\" and \"That’s When Your Heartaches Begin.\" Presley paid $4 for an acetate, intending the recording as a birthday present for his mother, Gladys.\n\n43. On July 5, 1954, the trio of Bill Black, Scotty Moore and Elvis Presley played for Sam Phillips in the studio of Memphis Recording Service. They played Bing Crosby's \"Harbor Lights\" and Leon Payne's \"I Love You Because.\" Later, Elvis started fooling around and singing the Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup song \"That's All Right (Mama).\" Phillips loved what he heard. They worked on the song over and over late into the night until Phillips had a hit.\n\n44. The sensation Elvis Presley caused with his spark-of-the-new 1954 milestone \"That's All Right\" heralded to many the arrival of rock 'n' roll. Clocking in under 2 minutes, the song hit the evening airwaves of Dewey Phillips' WHBQ-AM radio show \"Red, Hot & Blue,\" as the disc jockey spun the tune a reported seven times the week after its July 5 recording.\n\n45. On July 19, 1954, Elvis Presley’s \"That's All Right\" was released as Sun single 209.\n\n46. The flipside of the “That’s All Right” single is \"Blue Moon of Kentucky.” Originally recorded as a waltz in 1947 by bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe, the song was a familiar hit in the South. Seven years later, at the suggestion of bassist Bill Black, Elvis would cut it himself, tarting up the tune with a hiccupy blues-pop reading during his famed July 1954 session at Sun, thus earning his sobriquet as the \"Hillbilly Cat.\"\n\n47. In January 1955, Elvis Presley meets “Colonel” Tom Parker, a promoter and manager who has worked with country stars Hank Snow and Eddy Arnold. Parker will sign on to manage Presley later that summer and oversee his career for the next 22 years until Presley's death.\n\n48.

Elvis signs with RCA Records in November 1955. Colonel Parker negotiates the sale of Presley’s Sun contract to RCA for $35,000. This includes a $5,000 bonus for Presley.\n\n51. Recorded in late 1955, Carl Perkins’ second single for Sun Records, “Blue Suede Shoes,\" was written in his bathroom on a brown paper bag at 3 a.m. Just a few months after its release in 1956, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" became the first song to simultaneously top the three major Billboard charts: Country, Rhythm and Blues, and Pop.\n\n52. Signed to Decca, Elvis Presley peers Johnny and Dorsey Burnette team with guitarist Paul Burlison as the Rock and Roll Trio. Their influential version of jazz man Tiny Bradshaw’s “The Train Kept a-Rollin' is cited as the first use of distorted guitar. Before dying in a 1964 boating accident, Johnny Burnette mellowed into the pop idol singer of “You're Sixteen” and “Dreamin'”.\n\n53. In 1956, Ferriday, Louisiana, piano phenom Jerry Lee Lewis auditions for Sun Records, where he records his rendition of “Crazy Arms” and his original \"End of The Road.”\n\n54.

Also, that month Presley signs a movie contract with Hal Wallis and Paramount Pictures.\n\n56. In 1956, budding singer-songwriter Jesse Winchester arrives in Memphis as a teen. The mellifluously voiced author of “The Brand New Tennessee Waltz,” “Mississippi, You’re on My Mind” and “Biloxi,” Winchester will become a favorite of critics and fellow musicians in the 1970s and be covered by a wide array of artists from Wilson Pickett to Reba McEntire. Bob Dylan once comments that, “You can’t talk about the best songwriters and not include him.”\n\n57. Sept. 9, 1956: Elvis makes the first of three appearances on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” attracting the highest ratings ever for any variety show, securing a whopping 80% of TV watchers.\n\n58. On Dec. 4, 1956, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash convene at Sam Phillips' Memphis Recording Service for a somewhat impromptu jam session and intermittent epistemological debate that came to be regarded as a milestone moment in popular music lore. The so-called \"Million Dollar Quartet\" would eventually come to be celebrated on record, in books and on Broadway.\n\n59. In 1957, Royal Studio, the home of Hi Records, opens in a former movie theater in South Memphis, with an Ampex 350 mono recorder installed by chief engineer Bill Cantrell, a co-founder of Hi.\n\n60. Elvis buys Graceland for $102,500 in March 1957. He moves into the home later that summer.\n\n61. In May 1957, Elvis begins work on his third motion picture, “Jailhouse Rock,” for MGM.\n\n62. A banker by day and country fiddle player by night, Jim Stewart forms Satellite Records, cutting the label’s first side in October 1957 with “Blue Roses.\"\n\n63.

Written in Memphis, it’s the story of a heartsick man chasing his lover along the twisting route of the Mississippi River from St. Paul to the Bluff City.\n\n64. Elvis Presley is inducted into the U.S. Army at the Memphis Draft Board. The King of Rock and Roll is assigned the serial number 53310761.\n\n65. In 1959, Arkansas-born Charlie Rich releases “Lonely Weekends” on Sun, considered one of the most important records in the evolution of '50s rockabilly into '60s country-pop. Nicknamed ''the Silver Fox,'' after his mane of prematurely white hair, Rich would go on to score hit after hit on the country charts the '70s, including “Behind Closed Doors\" and “The Most Beautiful Girl.” Sun’s Sam Phillips often described Rich as the most talented musician he’d ever worked with.\n\n66. In 1960, Stax Records — now based in South Memphis’ old Capitol Theatre — releases a duet between Rufus and Carla Thomas titled “Cause I Love You,” which becomes a hit and draws the attention of Atlantic Records’ Jerry Wexler. Atlantic signs a distribution deal with Stax soon after.\n\n67. Neighborhood musicians begin hanging around Stax's 926 E. McLemore Ave. studio, among them organist Booker T. Jones, guitarist Steve Cropper and eventually bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson Jr., who will form Booker T. and the MG's.\n\n68. Elvis is officially discharged from active duty in the U.S. Army on March 5, 1960. He returns home to Memphis three days later.\n\n69. In February 1961, Sam Phillips opens a state-of-the-art facility just a few blocks away from the old Memphis Recording Service. The new Sam Phillips Recording Service is located at 639 Madison Ave., where it continues to operate today.\n\n70. July 1961: The Mar-Keys' instrumental \"Last Night\" on Satellite becomes a national hit. It's discovered that there's also a California label called Satellite, so the Memphis-based Satellite becomes Stax (created from the names Stewart and Axton).\n\n71. Released in fall 1961, William Bell's classic Stax ballad, “You Don’t Miss Your Water,\" reaches the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n72. Booker T. & the MG's (which stands for Memphis Group) record and release \"Green Onions,\" which puts Stax on the charts in 1962.\n\n73. Also in 1962, Johnny Jenkins comes to the Stax studio to record a single for Atlantic. During the last half hour, the studio time is used by Jenkins' 21-year-old driver, Otis Redding, who records a ballad he's written called \"These Arms of Mine.\" It's released in October on Stax's subsidiary, Volt.\n\n74. Willie plays: In 1963, Willie Mitchell releases “Sunrise Serenade” on the Hi Records label, the first of more than a dozen instrumental soul albums the trumpeter and band leader will record.\n\n75. Rufus Thomas is 46 when his signature hit \"Walking the Dog\" becomes a top-10 smash on the pop charts for Stax Records in 1963.\n\n76. In September 1963, Otis Redding comes back to Stax to record \"Pain In My Heart.\"\n\n77. B.B. King releases a 1964 concert album recorded in Chicago, “Live at the Regal,” which remains one of the great blues LPs. King’s guitar work would resonate especially strongly in Britain, where a generation of budding blues guitarists — from Eric Clapton to Jeff Beck to Jimmy Page — would feel his impact in the 1960s.\n\n78. Born and raised in Memphis, Cassietta George began singing at her father's church as an infant and would become a legend in the world of gospel. George's 1964 classic “Walk Around Heaven All Day” — which she composed and sang — remains a standard of the genre.\n\n79. In 1964, with the help of local songwriter and manager Roosevelt Jamison, gospel singer O.V. Wright enters the R&B field in spectacular fashion. The Jamison-penned, Wright-sung classic \"That's How Strong My Love Is\" (later covered by Otis Redding and many others) marked the first hit for Quinton Claunch's local Goldwax label and launched Wright's secular career.\n\n80. Texas-bred, turban-wearing, hearse-driving Sam \"The Sham\" Samudio brings his group The Pharaohs to Memphis in 1964. They would cut the organ-fueled romp \"Wooly Bully\" at Sam Phillips' studio, and the tune's signature Tex-Mex count-off (\"Uno, dos, one, two, tres, quatro.\") would help the song sell millions of copies in 1965, and become Billboard's record of the year. Over the decades it's been covered countless times by everyone from Alvin and the Chipmunks to Bruce Springsteen.\n\n81. In 1964, guitarist Mabon \"Teenie\" Hodges becomes a member of Willie Mitchell’s band. In 1965, his brothers Charles and Leroy would also join, playing organ and bass. They would soon add drummer Howard Grimes, thus birthing the core of what would become known as Hi Rhythm, the band that helped sire hits for Al Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Clay and many others.\n\n82. Memphis disc jockey and television personality George Klein launches WHBQ-TV's popular teen music program \"Talent Party\" in 1964. Known on pop radio as \"The Geeker in your Speaker\" (\"Geeker\" being pronounced \"Jeeker,\" a nickname inspired his initials, \"G.K.\"), Klein befriended Elvis when the two boys met at Humes High School and he was Presley's best man during the singer's 1967 marriage to Priscilla in Las Vegas.\n\n83. Eddie Floyd signs on with Stax as a songwriter in 1965 and would score a major hit as a solo artist the following year with his signature “Knock on Wood,” a song originally intended for Otis Redding.\n\n84. In 1965, local teen garage band The Gentrys cut a million-selling smash called \"Keep on Dancing.\"\n\n85. Also in 1965, Atlantic brings Wilson Pickett to Memphis to record at Stax, and his three sessions yield classics including \"In the Midnight Hour,\" \"634-5789\" and \"Ninety-Nine and A Half (Won't Do).\"\n\n86. Jerry Lee Lewis drops his 1966 burner “Memphis Beat”: “I’m goin’ to Memphis where the beat is tough,” hails the Killer, who found his sound, fame and fortune here. “It makes you tremble and it makes you weak/Gets in your blood, that Memphis beat.”\n\n87. In 1966, John Fry launches Ardent’s first commercial studio, at 1457 National. Ardent would become a hub for like-minded musicians and aspiring producers, including Jim Dickinson and Terry Manning, who would enjoy long associations with the studio.\n\n88. In 1966, Johnnie Taylor signs to Stax, where he was dubbed \"The Philosopher of Soul.\" His hits included \"I've Got to Love Somebody's Baby,\" written by Isaac Hayes and David Porter.\n\n89. Memphis garage band The Guilloteens release the minor classic \"I Don't Believe\" in 1966, the peak of a short-lived but colorful career that saw them signed to Hanna-Barbera Records — the label imprint of the famed animation company. A popular club draw in both Memphis and Los Angeles, The Guilloteens' fans included a number of celebrity supporters like the Righteous Brothers, the Byrds and Elvis Presley.\n\n90. Though Aretha Franklin's physical presence in Memphis may have been short-lived — she was born here but moved at age 2, ending up in Detroit — her musical connection to the Bluff City was long-lasting. In fact, the whole history of Memphis music might have been radically altered had Franklin signed with Stax Records as she was once poised to in 1966.\n\n91. Carla Thomas is the \"Queen\" of Stax to Otis Redding's \"King.\" Their album “King & Queen” is released in 1967.\n\n92.

Between 1967 and 1972, American — led by producer Chips Moman and house band the Memphis Boys — would cut 122 chart records, an unmatched achievement. This included the Box Tops (\"Cry Like a Baby\"), Dusty Springfield (\"Son of a Preacher Man\"), Neil Diamond (\"Sweet Caroline\"), B.J. Thomas (\"Hooked on a Feeling\"), Bobby Womack (\"Fly Me To The Moon\") and, most famously, Elvis Presley (\"Suspicious Minds\").\n\n97.

Taylor's \"Who's Making Love\" is one of the year's big R&B smashes.\n\n104. Recorded on April 4, 1968, in the immediate aftermath of Martin Luther King’s assassination, “Hotel Lorraine” by Otis Spann would capture the pain of King’s murder. Driven by a mournful piano, death march drums and Spann’s wounded, needle-pinning howl, it’s both an elegy and an exorcism that ultimately tries to make sense out of the chaos of the moment.\n\n105. Dec. 3, 1968: “Elvis,” the TV program better known as “The ’68 Comeback” airs on NBC-TV and is one of the biggest television hits of the year.\n\n106. Elvis returns to Memphis in January 1969, working at American Sounds Studios with producer Chips Moman and the Memphis Boys house band. The collaboration between Elvis, Moman and the Memphis Boys would result in Presley's return to the charts, as “Suspicious Minds” reached No. 1, and the resulting album, “From Elvis in Memphis,” would become a gold-selling global smash hit.\n\n107. Trumpeter Wayne Jackson and saxophonist Andrew Love made their early reputation as part of the house band at Stax Records in the 1960s. In 1969 they incorporate as The Memphis Horns, working with institutions like Hi Records and American Studios, and eventually becoming the most in-demand horn section in the world.\n\n108. Stax producer and songwriter Isaac Hayes steps into the spotlight with the 1969 LP “Hot Buttered Soul,” which sells over 3 million its first year.\n\n109.

As chairman and CEO of the Sun Entertainment Holding Corp., Singleton would be responsible for mining the Sun archives with a steady stream of reissues and archival releases from the label's vaults. He developed the Sun brand, licensing the company logo for T-shirts and other merchandise.\n\n110. First-generation Sun rocker Billy Lee Riley becomes one of the first artists signed to Singleton's reactivated Sun Records label in 1969.\n\n111. Considered one of the greatest records of the era, British singer Dusty Springfield's \"Dusty In Memphis\" is released in March 1969.\n\n112. B.B. King’s influence on a generation of rock musicians and guitarists would lead to his late-’60s/early-’70s crossover to the white market. King would have his biggest chart triumph with 1969’s Top-20 hit and Grammy-winning single “The Thrill Is Gone.”\n\n113. Al Green meets bandleader and Hi Records vice president Willie Mitchell while on tour in Texas in 1969, and Mitchell signs Green to Hi.

In November 1971, John Fry's Ardent Studios — now doing much of the overflow recording for Stax — moves into a newly built complex at 2000 Madison in Midtown.\n\n118.

Spring 1973: Al Green and Hi keep rolling. Green's “Call Me” is released, with hits \"You Ought to Be With Me,\" \"Call Me\" and \"Here I Am.\"\n\n127. For a couple of weeks in 1973, two of Memphis’ greatest icons, Elvis Presley and Stax Records, were joined together. Presley had a rich history of working in his hometown, launching his recording career at Sun Records in the mid-'50s and then reviving it at American Studios in the late '60s. By the early '70s — following his triumphant return to the stage and the road — he was looking to start yet another chapter by cutting a pair of sessions at the Bluff City’s hottest house of music, Stax Records.\n\n128. Soul diva Ann Peebles releases the 1973 hit “I Can’t Stand the Rain.\" A native of East St. Louis, Illinois, Peebles was discovered by bandleader Gene “Bowlegs” Miller and arrived in Memphis in 1968. She quickly fell in with Hi Records, working first as a songwriter (often in tandem with her future husband Don Bryant) and then later as a solo artist. Under the tutelage of producer Willie “Pops” Mitchell, and backed by the Hi Rhythm section, Peebles would become an R&B hitmaker during the decade. In addition to 1973’s career-defining “I Can’t Stand the Rain,” Peebles would create a succession of deep-soul classics, including “I’m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down,” “I Feel Like Breaking Up Somebody’s Home” and “Come to Mama.”\n\n129. In 1974, Isaac Hayes becomes part owner of the Bluff City's first professional hoops franchise, the ill-fated ABA (American Basketball Association) team, the Memphis Tams.\n\n130. That same year Hayes stars in “Truck Turner.” The so-called \"blaxploitation\" film casts Hayes as Mack \"Truck\" Turner, a bounty hunter caught in a \"pimp civil war.\" (When Turner visits a posh brothel, one girl purrs: \"Check out that big piece of chocolate cake!\") When Hayes received the Memphis Film Forum's \"Memphian in Film Excellence\" award at the Memphis International Film Festival in March 2007, he asked that \"Truck Turner\" be screened after the ceremony.\n\n131. Fledgling piano man Billy Joel makes his debut in 1974 playing a series of concerts at Lafayette’s Music Room. Joel would return to the Bluff City half a dozen times in the next few years — opening shows at Ellis Auditorium and headlining other smaller venues like The Ritz. By 1977, with the release of his smash “The Stranger,” Joel finally took top billing in a big room, the Cook Convention Center.\n\n132. Memphis power-popper Tommy Hoehn kicks off his solo career with the 1975 single, \"Blow Yourself Up.\" He would follow that up with a pair of late-'70s LPs, “Spacebreak” and “Losing You to Sleep,” for the Powerplay and London Records labels.\n\n133.

Al Green records a final album, \"Have a Good Time,\" with Willie Mitchell and Hi Rhythm. Green would leave his longtime creative home for his own newly built American Music studio, where he would self-produce the spiritually resonant masterpiece \"The Belle Album.\" His Hi label swansong \"Truth N' Time\" came out in 1978. After that, he abandoned secular music entirely for a decade, finding comfort (and considerable success) as a gospel artist.\n\n139. In 1977, Stax Records' assets and master recordings are sold to Berkeley, California-based Fantasy Records. Also that year, noted civil rights attorney Irvin Salky would help create one of Memphis’ defining events. An ardent champion of Mid-South music, as an artist manager, Salky helped revive the careers of jazz pianist Phineas Newborn and bluesman Furry Lewis. In 1977, he personally funded and launched the inaugural Beale Street Music Festival.\n\n140. Elvis Presley dies on Aug. 16, 1977. He was 42.\n\n141. In 1978, the Rolling Stones play the Mid-South Coliseum. The crowd roars as the house lights go down, but the moment brings a surprise as a stagehand sets up a metal folding chair for blues legend Furry Lewis to sit on while as he plays his second opening gig for the Stones in Memphis.\n\n142. On Dec. 9, 1978, the final single released on the Stax label, the Bar-Kays' \"Holy Ghost,\" enters the R&B charts.\n\n143. In the early morning hours of Dec. 27, 1978, Big Star co-founder Chris Bell was driving home to East Memphis from Ardent Studios when he lost control of his car and crashed into a light pole at the intersection of Poplar and Grove Park. He was killed instantly. Bell, 27, would become iconic over the next four decades as the legend of Big Star grew.\n\n144. Released in 1979, the compilation album \"Beale Street Saturday Night\" was commissioned — arguably at Beale Street's nadir — by the now-defunct Memphis Development Foundation as a fundraiser for their attempts to restore the historic Orpheum Theatre, which had fallen into disrepair. It featured blues legends Furry Lewis and Sleepy John Estes, folk artists Sid Selvidge, and Hi Records stalwart Teenie Hodges.\n\n145. Drug-related health problems finally catch up with soul great O.V. Wright in 1979, after a severe heart condition weakened his body. He spent his final months in a hospital, checking out for a couple hours a day and heading to Willie Mitchell's Royal Studio to record what would become his final album. Eventually withered down to 115 pounds, Wright suffered a final heart attack while on the road and died on Nov. 16, 1980.\n\n146. In 1981, Dr. George Nichopoulos, known as “Dr. Nick,” was acquitted on charges that he overprescribed drugs to Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and seven others. Despite the acquittal, Elvis’ passing would haunt him over the next 39 years — and the once-respected physician would be hounded by medical board authorities and eventually stripped of his license in 1995. Dr. Nick died in 2016.\n\n147. In 1982, Al Green wins his first Grammy, in the Best Traditional Soul Gospel Performance category, for \"The Lord Will Make a Way.\"\n\n148. In September 1985, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and producer Chips Moman convene for the recording of a project titled “Class Of 55.\" Moman recorded the reunion album using the four legendary rock 'n' rollers who got their starts in Memphis.\n\n149. On Jan. 23, 1986, Sam Phillips, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis are among the first class inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n150. In 1987, singer-songwriter Steve Earle leaves the MCA Nashville label, switching to the company’s revived rock imprint, Uni, and comes to Ardent’s Memphis studios where he records the classic LP “Copperhead Road.”\n\n151. Also in 1987, Minneapolis rockers The Replacements release a tribute song called “Alex Chilton.” Recorded at Midtown’s Ardent Studios, the anthem was a cockeyed homage to their friend, onetime producer and occasional road companion, the odd, inscrutable Chilton — singer for the Box Tops, leader of Big Star and iconoclastic solo artist.\n\n152. In 1988, actor Dennis Quaid moves to Memphis for the filming of \"Great Balls of Fire!,\" a Jerry Lee Lewis biopic released the following year that largely focuses on the Killer's relationship with his child bride and cousin, Myra (played by Winona Ryder).\n\n153. Also in 1988, Rolling Stone Keith Richards asks Willie Mitchell to work on his first solo album; rock and pop stars, including Tina Turner, Boz Scaggs, John Mayer and many others would do the same over the years.\n\n154. On Dec. 6, 1988, Roy Orbison died. The Texas-born tenor began his career at Memphis' Sun Records, where he achieved some small success with the rockabilly-flavored single \"Ooby Dooby\" and wrote hits for the Everly Brothers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and Rick Nelson. In the early '60s, Orbison found his niche as a solo artist with a series of romantic, operatic hits including \"Only the Lonely\" and \"Crying,\" and rave-ups like \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" and \"Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream).\" Orbison enjoyed a late-career comeback as a solo artist and the centerpiece of the rock 'n' roll supergroup the Traveling Wilburys.\n\n155. In August 1989, the original Stax studio is torn down.\n\n156. September 1990 brings the first mention of future pop star Justin Timberlake in The Commercial Appeal as the paper reports on the results of the Mid-South Fair Junior Youth Talent Contest preliminaries. The paper notes that that vocal group category includes a combo called \"More Than Wonderful, composed of Holly Gaines, 11, and Justin Timberlake, 9, both of the Memphis area.\"\n\n157. As the CD boom hits in 1991, “The Complete Stax-Volt Singles, 1959-1968,” a nine-CD box set, is released.\n\n158. Cult Stax artist Wendy Rene’s “After Laughter” is sampled by the hip-hop group the Wu-Tang Clan for the 1992 track “Tearz” off their “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)” album. More than a decade later, the song was incorporated by Alicia Keys into “Where Do We Go From Here” on her platinum-selling 2007 album “As I Am.”\n\n159. In 1992, Blues singer \"Little\" Laura Dukes, a mainstay of Beale Street and the Memphis music scene for almost 80 years, dies at 85. Born in Memphis in 1907, she was one of four children of Alex Dukes, a drummer in W.C. Handy's band.\n\n160. The country of Ghana crowns Isaac Hayes a king for his humanitarian work in 1992.\n\n161. Formed in the college town of Tempe, Arizona, in 1987, alt-pop band the Gin Blossoms would record a pair of hit LPs at Midtown's Ardent Studios. Their first effort, 1992's \"New Miserable Experience\" became a slow-growing hit, selling 4 million copies on the strength of radio and MTV favorites like \"Hey Jealousy\" and \"Found Out About You.\" Their 1995 follow-up album, \"Congratulations, I'm Sorry,\" earned them another platinum album and a Grammy nomination.\n\n162. 1993: Rap duo 8Ball & MJG (Premro Smith and Marlon Jermaine Goodwin) release their first tracks. The pair emerge from Ridgeway Middle School and Orange Mound to become one of the city's most popular and respected rap acts, releasing eight albums in total. In 2018, the group becomes the second hip-hop act (following Three 6 Mafia) to be inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.\n\n163. In 1993, Oblivians member Eric Friedl founds the Goner Records label in order to release “Wolf Rock,” an album by Japanese garage outfit Guitar Wolf. More than 25 years later, Goner’s empire — led by Friedl and longtime partner Zac Ives — includes a still-flourishing label (now with more than 100 releases to its credit), a thriving Cooper-Young-based retail store, mail-order business and the annual Gonerfest concert extravaganza, which draws bands and fans from all over the world to town each September.\n\n164. In 1994, eight of Robert “Wolfman” Belfour’s songs are featured on musicologist Dr. David Evans’ compilation album “The Spirit Lives On, Deep South Country Blues and Spirituals in the 1990s.” After gaining the attention of Mississippi’s Fat Possum, Hill Country bluesman Belfour releases a pair of much-lauded albums — 2000’s “What’s Wrong with You” and 2003’s “Pushin’ My Luck” — for the label.\n\n165. Esteemed Memphis folk singer Sid Selvidge becomes executive producer of the Beale Street Caravan radio show in 1996, leading the internationally syndicated show until his passing in 2013.\n\n166. In 1997, Isaac Hayes lends his voice to the smooth-talking, sweet-love-making Chef on \"South Park,\" a role he will perform for nearly a decade.\n\n167. In 1998, Fox’s “That '70s Show” premieres, using a version of Memphis band Big Star’s “In the Street” as its theme song.\n\n168. In 1999, Bob Dylan and Paul Simon brought their co-headlining tour to Downtown's Memphis' Pyramid. Dylan saluted his old running buddy, The Man in Black, with an inspired version of Johnny Cash's 1956 chart topper, “I Walk the Line.\"\n\n169. In 2000, Three 6 Mafia featuring the Hypnotize Camp Posse put out the song “M.E.M.P.H.I.S.”\n\n170. Spring 2001: Ground is broken on the Stax Museum of American Music in Memphis, at the site of the old studios.\n\n171. On Dec. 16, 2001, Rufus Thomas, the man known as the “world’s oldest teenager” — and one of the Bluff City's most influential and colorful entertainers, with a career that spanned more than 70 years — dies at the age of 84.\n\n172. Hailed as rock 'n' roll's great architect, Sam Phillips, 80, dies at Memphis St. Francis Hospital of respiratory failure on July 30, 2003.\n\n173. The Stax Museum of American Soul Music is opened in May 2003. The museum campus in South Memphis will eventually include the Stax Music Academy and Soulsville Charter School.\n\n174. Memphis rapper Yo Gotti releases his city-wide celebration “Reppin’ North Memphis\" in 2003: “Yo Gotti from the north so you know what I’m about/But still kick it tough with my thugs in the south.”\n\n175. The Johnny Cash biopic “Walk the Line\" — starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon — wraps shooting in Memphis on Sept. 1, 2004. The film will become a box office hit and Oscar winner when it is released the following year.\n\n176. At the 78th annual Academy Awards in 2006, Memphis rappers Three 6 Mafia make history by winning Best Original Song for “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp,” their soundtrack contribution to the Craig Brewer film \"Hustle & Flow.\" Three 6 become the first rap group to win an Academy Award and the first rap act to perform at the Oscars.\n\n177. MTV's reality show, \"Adventures in Hollyhood,\" about Oscar-winning rap group Three 6 Mafia, premieres on April 5, 2007.\n\n178. In 2008, Willie Mitchell receives the Trustee's Award from the Grammy Foundation at ceremonies in Los Angeles, honoring his lifetime achievements.\n\n179. B.B. King remained dedicated to his Delta roots. For more than 30 years, he performed an annual homecoming concert in Indianola, Mississippi. In 2008 came the opening of The B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center — a gleaming 20,000-square-foot, $14 million facility celebrating his life and career.\n\n180. In summer 2009, Memphis lost one of its truly unique rock 'n' roll characters, Billy Lee Riley. Considered by many to be Sun Records' lost giant, Riley was a true multi-threat: He possessed the myriad musical gifts of Carl Perkins, the unhinged spirit of Jerry Lee Lewis, and the punkish insouciance of Elvis Presley — yet fate never rewarded Riley beyond cult acclaim.\n\n181. In September 2009, Poplar Tunes, the iconic record store — where Elvis Presley shopped, which deejay Dewey Phillips championed, and whose success helped fund Hi Records — closed its doors abruptly. The original location at 308 Poplar — founded by Joe Cuoghi and John Novarese just after World War II — and a second site at 4622 Faronia called Pop Tunes were shut down by Music City Record Distributors, the Nashville-based company that acquired the stores in 2001.\n\n182. The career of punk rock polymath Jimmy Lee Lindsey Jr., better known as Jay Reatard — the creative force behind the Reatards, Lost Sounds, Final Solutions and Angry Angles — is cut short when he dies in his Cooper-Young home on Jan. 13, 2010.\n\n183. One of Memphis' most beloved and inimitable blues figures, Wilroy Sanders dies in February 2010. Sanders was founder and leader of Memphis blues outfit the Fieldstones and owner of the old Green's Lounge. Sanders was the subject of a 1999 video documentary, produced by local music label Shangri-La Projects, titled \"The Last Living Bluesman.\"\n\n184. In March 2010, Alex Chilton, the pop hitmaker, cult icon and Memphis rock iconoclast best known as a member of 1960s pop-soul act the Box Tops and the 1970s power-pop act Big Star, dies in New Orleans at the age of 59.\n\n185. Legendary Mississippi bluesman Willie \"Pinetop\" Perkins becomes the oldest Grammy Award winner in history when \"Joined at the Hip,\" his LP with fellow veteran Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith, took home the trophy for Best Traditional Blues Album at the 2011 ceremonies. The Belzoni-born pianist would die just a month later at age 97.\n\n186. In 2012, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame enshrines its inaugural class at the Cannon Center, inducting Bluff City icons like W.C. Handy, Elvis Presley, B.B. King, Jerry Lee Lewis and Al Green; and lesser-known figures like jazz saxophonist George Coleman, gospel songwriter Lucie Campbell, and Booker T. Washington high school bandmaster W.T. McDaniel.\n\n187. Feel Like Going Home: 2013 saw a pair of musical sons return home. Alabama native and longtime Memphis hitmaker Dan Penn came back to play his first local show in 16 years. Penn’s two-set, 2 ½-hour concert at Rhodes College was a reminder of why he’s considered one of the pillars of Southern soul. Similarly, Sam & Dave’s Sam Moore returned after 16 years as well. Moore was the honored artist and performer at the annual Blues Ball, and his mild estrangement from his old label home ended with his emotionally charged first visit to the Stax Museum.\n\n188. Bruno Mars comes to Memphis in 2014 as producer Mark Ronson enlists him and his writing partner Philip Lawrence to work on the track \"Uptown Funk,\" which was partly written and recorded at South Memphis' Royal Studios. The track would become one of the biggest pop hits of the decade (and earn Royal engineer Boo Mitchell a Grammy honor).\n\n189. Taking place on what would’ve been Elvis Presley’s 80th birthday in 2015, the singer’s first recording, a 78 mm acetate of the songs “My Happiness” and “That’s When Your Heartaches Begin” cut at the Memphis Recording Service in 1953, was auctioned off at Graceland. The disc sold for $240,000 and was won by an online bidder who “wishes to remain anonymous” — but turned out to be contemporary rock star Jack White.\n\n190. A musical giant, cultural icon and pre-eminent influence on guitarists for more than 60 years, B.B. King was singularly synonymous with the blues music he loved and helped turn into a global touchstone. The Mississippi-born legend died at his home in Las Vegas on May 14, 2015.\n\n191. In 2015, Memphis singer-songwriter Julien Baker releases her solo debut, \"Sprained Ankle.\" The disc — which will make Baker one of the most acclaimed talents to emerge from Memphis in years — was recorded while she was still a student at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\n192. Farewell to Ben Cauley. Though he may not have been as well-known as some of his Stax Records brethren, the trumpeter and longtime Bar-Kays member seemed to symbolize so much about the label and the city of Memphis itself. Cauley was the sole survivor of the 1967 plane crash that claimed eight people, including Stax star Otis Redding, and the rest of his fellow Bar-Kays bandmates. Yet, despite the crash and subsequent setbacks, Cauley’s life was not defined by tragedy, but rather overcoming it. Cauley died in 2015 at the age of 67 — but his joy for life and music were plentiful, and his triumph absolute.\n\n193. Justin Timberlake becomes the youngest member of the Memphis Music Hall of Fame during ceremonies at the Cannon Center in October 2015. He accepts his award to a standing ovation. “I never prepared a speech for anything,” he said, by way of introduction. “But this is the (expletive) coolest thing that’s ever happened to me.”\n\n194. One of the foundational figures in rock 'n' roll, a profoundly influential guitarist, and the musician who helped Elvis Presley become The King, Scotty Moore dies in Nashville on June 30, 2016, after a period of ill health. He was 84.\n\n195. Yo Gotti got his start in the mid-'90s as one of the city's quintessential street rappers before transforming into a mainstream star. That unlikely chrysalis came about with partnership between his label CMG and Epic Records and the release of \"I Am\" in 2013. But it was \"The Art of Hustle,\" released in 2016, that finally gave Gotti wings. The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard album charts, hit No. 1 on the R&B/hip-hop charts, and quickly proved a breakthrough for the veteran MC.\n\n196. Memphian William Eggleston releases \"Musik\" in 2017. The disc is a rather auspicious debut, coming as it does from the 77-year-old Eggleston, a man widely hailed as the father of color photography and one of America's greatest living artists. Eggleston's music credentials include use of his photographs on album covers by Big Star, Primal Scream, Jimmy Eat World and Spoon, among others. \"Musik\" finds him creating behind a keyboard rather than a camera.\n\n197. In March 2017, Graceland officials formally opened a new entertainment complex. Public ceremonies marked the start of a four-day grand opening celebration for \"Elvis Presley's Memphis,\" a 200,000-square-foot, $45 million project across from Presley's mansion in Memphis' Whitehaven neighborhood.\n\n198. In October 2017, the first Mempho Music Fest marks the return of major concerts to Shelby Farms Park. the event is highlighted by a mini-reunion of Booker T. & the MG's alums Booker T. Jones and Steve Cropper. Cropper notes, somewhat poignantly, that the deaths of the other MGs — drummer Al Jackson Jr., bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and Lewie Steinberg — had left them as the last men standing. \"It's just Booker T and the MG now,\" Cropper said.\n\n199. Amazon Music launches its \"Produced By\" series, pairing notable producers with popular artists, both old and new. Inaugurating the project is multiple Grammy-winning Memphis engineer/producer Matt Ross-Spang. Spang produces four new tracks with Memphis soul legends Rev. Al Green and William Bell, singer-songwriting great John Prine and Americana darling Margo Price.\n\n200. The Bar-Kays began as a local high school sock-hop band in 1964, became Stax soul hit makers in the ’60s, then were decimated in the 1967 plane crash that claimed most of the band and Otis Redding. The Bar-Kays' ’70s rebirth followed, as did a reinvention as snake-charming funk futurists. In 2019, their story — one marked by tragedy and transition and ultimately triumph — continues 55 years on. As ever, the Bar-Kays are a band in perpetual motion.\n\nDoing stories that make our community better takes times and resources.

The federal government's webpage for the Food for Peace program appears to no longer exist, and neither does the rest of the USAID website.\n\nSpeaking with reporters in Topeka on Monday, U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, acknowledged the state's ties to Food for Peace while alleging that USAID was plagued by improper payments.\n\n\"It's something that I want to be part of, but I want it to be efficient, and I don't want the thugs stealing the food and stealing the money as well,\" Marshall said in response to a question from The Capital-Journal. \"So I think there's a right way to do it; there's a wrong way to do it. I think it's very good to take a pause on all of our money that we're sending outside of this country.\n\n\"Let's make America first again. Let's get our own house in order.\"\n\nBut Musk's comments make his actions appear to be less like a pause in foreign aid and more like a permanent elimination.\n\nMusk called USAID \"beyond repair\" and \"hopeless\" on Monday, USA TODAY reported. Then, in a post on X, Musk said, \"We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.\" In a Sunday post, he said \"USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.\" In another, he said \"USAID is evil.\"\n\nMusk said he detailed his plan to Trump, and the president \"agreed that we should shut it down\" — even though the administration does not have congressional approval to close the foreign assistance agency.\n\nMarshall, who is on the Senate agriculture committee, said he raised concerns about USAID with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, whom Trump tasked in November with establishing an informal Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"There is significant fraud and abuse, and we're just taken for granted,\" Marshall said. \"As I travel to these countries, they just take us for granted. I've just never seen any more abuse than I have through the USAID program. As a matter of fact, this is one of the very first things I spoke to Elon and and Vivek about was the problems in the USAID program. There's just a whole lot of fraud, waste and abuse. We're not using it to our to our advantage anymore.\"\n\nFood for Peace started in Kansas\n\nSince the 1950s, Food for Peace has used America's agricultural surpluses to fight world hunger, expand international trade and advance foreign diplomacy.\n\nThe Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas has outlined the history of the Food for Peace program. So has U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, R-Kansas, who celebrated its 70th anniversary last summer. The Kansas Association of Wheat Growers touted the history during a 2023 farm bill listening session.\n\n\"Over the past 70 years, Food for Peace has fed more than 4 billion people in 150 countries,\" Mann said in a July 2024 statement. \"With the world facing a severe hunger crisis due to inflation, natural disasters, and global wars in Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen, Food for Peace is more important now than ever.\n\n\"I am grateful for the two brave Kansans who saw America's ability to answer the noble calling to feed a hungry world and to recognizing it as the morally right, strategically wise, and fiscally responsible thing to do.\"\n\nThe idea started in 1953 with Cheyenne County farmer Peter O'Brien, who shared it at a local Farm Bureau meeting. Fellow Kansan U.S. Sen. Andy Schoeppel sponsored the legislation, which was signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, another Kansan, in 1954.\n\nAt the time, according to the Dole Institute, \"U.S. agricultural surpluses reached alarming levels, and storage of excess grain cost the government millions of dollars per year — even as the food deteriorated and became inedible.\"\n\nThe program \"benefited the U.S. by decreasing food surpluses and by creating new markets for its agricultural products, while also providing many countries with starving populations some much-needed humanitarian aid.\"\n\nAnother Kansan, U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, authored an amendment in 1966 where American farmers, dubbed the \"Bread and Butter Corps,\" would travel to developing countries to teach them skills for growing crops. He also pushed for language to exclude communist countries from benefiting. Food for Peace also led to other bipartisan food programs championed by Dole.\n\n\"This constructive use of U.S. farm abundance is one of the most inspiring activities ever undertaken by any country in world history,\" Dole said in an undated quote, according to the Dole Institute. \"The program has helped the U.S. maintain its position as the world's leading exporter of food and fiber and shares U.S. abundance with friendly peoples abroad, effectively supplementing world agricultural trade.\"\n\nAt a 2023 farm bill listening session in Saline County, U.S. Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Pennsylvania, said, \"People with full bellies are less likely to engage in war and terrorism. And so that makes all of you and that makes the American farmer a champion for world peace.\"\n\nKansas congressional delegation has supported Food for Peace\n\nThe Kansas congressional delegation has supported Food for Peace in the past.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine, U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, said, \"Food stability is essential to political stability.\"\n\n\"It is critical to utilize every tool at our disposal to combat this worsening hunger crisis,\" Moran said in March 2022, noting that he is a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee that funds Food for Peace.\n\nMoran also was a vocal supporter of foreign food aid when Trump proposed cuts during his first administration.\n\nMann, who is on the House agriculture committee, helped hold a sign touting USAID food aid in June 2023 while announcing the introduction of legislation to ensure Food for Peace uses American-grown commodities.\n\n\"America's international food aid programs have enjoyed bipartisan support for more than 65 years because they are simple, effective, and they feed millions of vulnerable people around the world each year,\" Mann said in a statement at the time. \"Through these programs, America fortifies our allies, counters the influence of foreign adversaries, creates new markets and trading partners, and stops wars before they start.\"\n\nMann described the legislation as restoring the Food for Peace program's original intent. It also would have named the emergency assistance portion of the program after O'Brien. The bill — which was dubbed the American Farmers Feed the World Act — did not advance.\n\nU.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, who is also on the House agriculture committee, cosponsored a resolution last summer that would have recognized the successes of Food for Peace.\n\nThe resolution said in fiscal year 2022, Food for Peace helped 53 million people in 21 countries with emergency food assistance and nearly 3 million people with resilience-building development assistance.\n\nSpokespeople for Moran and Mann didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. A Davids spokesperson declined to comment for this story, but pointed to a Davids op-ed in Newsweek where she called on Trump to focus on affordability issues while raising concerns about his government efficiency efforts.\n\nTrump and Musk move to end Kansas legacy without congressional input\n\nAre Musk and Trump killing a 70-year-old Kansas legacy?\n\n\"Yes, or at least it seems to be an attempt to,\" said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka. \"It's hard to tell with this president. It's just hard to tell really what the intentions are.\"\n\nBeatty said constitutional law scholars argue a president cannot shut down a federal agency, but at least some members of Congress are going along with it.\n\n\"It's a larger question of many members of Congress seemingly ceding their power to a president,\" he said. \"That's interesting. The separation of powers was set up a long time ago for a reason, and one reason was because the president is not a king.\"\n\nBeatty, who teaches an introduction to international relations course, said Republicans and Democrats after World War II supported aid for struggling countries with a belief it would prevent another world war.\n\n\"It was that post-war period of Truman and Eisenhower and Kennedy and every president after who believed that it was in America's best interests to alleviate chaos and disorder around the globe and for America to form friendships and alliances as well,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean that a president is not allowed to completely change that idea, but if that is what is happening, it is one of the more significant changes in American foreign policy since 1945.\"\n\nThe principle, he said, was that chaos abroad is a threat to American security at home.\n\n\"Kansas has a special link to that foreign policy because Kansas farmers have been helping to supply food to countries that need it, and Kansas leaders have been strong proponents of it through all these years,\" Beatty said. \"So if Donald Trump wants to change this policy, that's very possible, but it's also a striking change if Kansas senators and Congress people want to change it as well.\"\n\n\"It would be surprising if the Kansas delegation supports the wholesale dismantling of foreign aid programs, including Food for Peace,\" he added, \"but I'm no longer surprised in the Trump era by many things.\"\n\nBeatty said foreign aid is less than 1% of the federal budget.\n\n\"In pure dollar terms, it always looks like a lot of money, and it is,\" he said. \"But as a percentage of America's budget, since 1945, American leaders consider it a bargain if it's going to significantly impact world peace and American foreign policy positively, which they decided it always has.\"\n\nJason Alatidd is a Statehouse reporter for The Topeka Capital-Journal.

On Monday, DOGE team members gained access to the building, with the help of local police from Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump had targeted the Institute of Peace as part of his and billionaire ally Elon Musk's sweeping efforts to slash federal bureaucracy and workforce.\n\nBut the issue, representatives for the institute argue, is employees at the Institute of Peace are not federal workers. The organization, which was founded by and receives annual funding from Congress, is independent of the executive branch.\n\nTuesday's lawsuit alleges that, under this status, the DOGE team's dramatic building entrance and a string of other actions that have upturned institute operations are unlawful.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized the peace organization's resistance, calling USIP employees \"rogue bureaucrats.\"\n\n\"This is what DOGE and this administration is facing. It's a resistance from bureaucrats who don't want to see change in this city,\" Leavitt said in a briefing Wednesday. \"President Trump was elected on an overwhelming mandate to seek change and implement change, and this is unacceptable.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson did not address requests for comment on some of the lawsuit's more specific allegations but said in a statement to USA TODAY, \"Rogue bureaucrats will not be allowed to hold agencies hostage. The Trump administration will enforce the President’s executive authority and ensure his agencies remain accountable to the American people.\"\n\nWhat is the Institute of Peace?\n\nThe U.S. Institute of Peace was created by Congress in 1984, under then-President Ronald Reagan, and specializes in resolving violent conflicts globally, according to its website.\n\nIn a letter to the Office of Management and Budget earlier this month, George Moose, then widely recognized as the president of USIP, said the institute's work “fully aligns” with Trump's priorities when it comes to preventing conflict and keeping the U.S. out of wars.\n\n“As has been the case throughout its 40 years of existence,\" Moose wrote, \"the Institute is committed to the efficient and responsible deployment of taxpayer funds in cooperation with Congress and the Administration.”\n\nThe recent lawsuit also argues that USIP advances Trump's professed mission of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of government.\n\nYet, the lawsuit documents state, “the President declared the Institute 'unnecessary' and directed steps to curtail its vital work.”\n\nDOGE probes began with Trump order\n\nIssues between DOGE and the Institute of Peace began last month, when Trump signed an executive order directing four agencies, including USIP, to reduce their personnel \"to the minimum presence and function required by law\" within 14 days.\n\nThe order incorrectly labeled the institute as a “governmental entit[y]” and part of the “federal bureaucracy,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe next day, DOGE reached out to the institute and set a virtual meeting for Monday, Feb. 24, according to the lawsuit. Three DOGE staffers were present, along with Moose and USIP counsel.\n\nIn the meeting, Moose and George Foote, USIP's outside counsel, outlined the institute's independent nature. According to Moose's recollection, a DOGE staffer said at the time \"that they understood our position and would 'regroup.'\"\n\nRumors of DOGE takeover start\n\nDays after Moose sent his letter to OMB, the lawsuit says he started hearing about inquiries made by DOGE staffers regarding the institute's building security.\n\nBy then, members of Musk's DOGE team were known to have already gained access to the offices of multiple executive agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service's in Washington and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's in Atlanta.\n\nFoote emailed DOGE staffers to let them know any “unauthorized personnel would only be admitted with a valid warrant issued by a court,” the lawsuit states. According to Foote, his message went unanswered.\n\nPresident, board members ousted\n\nOn Friday, multiple board members received termination notices via email.\n\nLawyers for the Institute of Peace and several of these targeted board members argue their removals did not follow proper procedure and are therefore null. Members of USIP's board can be terminated for wrongdoing, such as a felony conviction; by agreement of at least eight other board members; or by a majority of members of multiple specific House and Senate committees, the lawsuit states.\n\nShortly after members received the emails, DOGE staffers arrived at USIP's office building near the Lincoln Memorial in D.C. They were denied entry, the lawsuit states, but returned again Friday evening, this time with FBI agents and a notice that the board now consisted of three people: Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Defense University President Peter Garvin.\n\nAnd, acting as the remaining fraction of the board, they had decided to remove Moose and replace him with State Department official Kenneth Jackson.\n\nRubio, Hegseth and Garvin are also named as defendants on USIP's lawsuit.\n\nDOGE returns, find a way in\n\nSunday evening, Foote, Moose and USIP’s chief of security decided to terminate their contract with a private security company, Inter-Con, out of fear that DOGE would coerce the contractors into granting them access to the headquarters, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe following afternoon, four members of Inter-Con's team arrived outside USIP's office. After they were first unable to enter with their now-deactivated security badges, one ex-employee brandished a physical key that USIP had not been able to confiscate yet, allowing the group to enter, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe lawsuit said that the building was put under lockdown, and Foote called Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. The contractors eventually left, after being warned multiple times they were trespassing\n\nJackson, the Trump administration's pick to be new USIP president, arrived later in a Black SUV. He spoke briefly with Foote and another lawyer, before leaving the premises.\n\nHours later on Monday, he and members of DOGE returned, this time to be let in by police officers who had just arrived.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the Metropolitan Police Department said that they were contacted and called to the scene by the U.S. Attorney's Office. Upon arrival, Jackson provided officers \"with documentation that he was the acting USIP President.\"\n\nAccording to the police department, all \"unauthorized individuals\" eventually vacated the premises without incident and no arrests were made.\n\nAs they were being led out, Foote said in the lawsuit he and others were told they would be able to retrieve their possessions at a later date.\n\nAs of the time the lawsuit was filed Tuesday, he said those belongings, including their cars, remain at the institute’s headquarters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2025/02/08/trump-remove-palestinians-gaza-us-control/78260610007/", "title": "I'm a Palestinian American. Trump's terrifying remarks on Gaza aren ...", "text": "Laila El-Haddad\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nFeb. 8, 2025 Updated Feb. 12, 2025, 9:45 a.m. ET\n\nIn chilling remarks made following his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, President Donald Trump declared that the United States should seize control over Gaza, after forcibly transferring Palestinians living there to other countries – a declaration he doubled down on social media.\n\nIt was a reckless display of ignorance and arrogance that echoes the same disdain for Palestinian lives and dignity that has been the hallmark of U.S. policy in the region. And it should not be taken lightly.\n\nAs a Palestinian American who calls Gaza home, I have watched in horror for the past 16 months as Israel, under Netanyahu’s leadership, slaughtered my family members and obliterated their way of life. This unrelenting onslaught has been so devastating that many legal experts and human rights organizations have called it a plausible genocide ‒ one that has been aided and abetted by former President Joe Biden, prompting me, along with individual Palestinian and organizational plaintiffs, to sue them for complicity.\n\nNow, Trump threatens to continue what the Biden administration started.\n\nTrump's plan is illegal and immoral ‒ and profoundly dangerous\n\nTrump’s plan is not only illegal and immoral; it is deeply irresponsible and dangerous, dismissing the rights and humanity of the people in Gaza.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nIt also obfuscates the underlying cause of their suffering: Israel’s more than half-century-old violent military occupation ‒ which predates Hamas' existence by decades ‒ its brutal siege and its repeated assaults on the Gaza Strip. These actions have choked the population, denied them freedom and dignity, and destroyed their livelihoods and futures.\n\nAnd it is the U.S. government, through unwavering military funding and diplomatic cover, that has allowed this to continue unchecked.\n\nAfter Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Netanyahu regime declared their intent to make Gaza unlivable by turning it into \"islands of ruins\" and to roll out another Nakba, which refers to the 750,000 Palestinians – more than 50% of the population in 1948 – who were expelled or fled from their homes after the creation of the state of Israel.\n\nIsraeli forces then proceeded to systematically destroy everything that sustains life in Gaza: schools, hospitals, places of worship, roads, water sources, and the vast majority of farmland and fishing fleets, leaving nothing but devastation in their wake.\n\nThis long-standing Israeli objective of maximizing control over the land while minimizing the Palestinian population has been a driving force behind Israeli policy for years. After the Hamas attack, Netanyahu encouraged his Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer to \"thin\" the population of Gaza, according to the Israel Hayom newspaper ‒ a chilling euphemism for forced transfer, or ethnic cleansing by any other name.\n\nInternational community can't turn its back on Gaza\n\nOn Tuesday, I joined four other Palestinian Americans in submitting a letter to the Human Rights and Special Prosecution Section of the Department of Justice, urging them to investigate Netanyahu for genocide, torture and war crimes, and to enforce the outstanding arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court against him.\n\nInstead of facing accountability, Netanyahu was welcomed to Washington, D.C., with red-carpet treatment: $1 billion in a new weapons deal, a promised additional $8.7 billion and a commitment from the United States to fulfill what I believe is his ultimate goal: the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza.\n\nTrump continues in Biden’s path by shielding and providing diplomatic cover for Israel ‒ setting a dangerous precedent that war criminals can operate with total impunity.\n\nListening to Trump, one might think Palestinians exist in some kind of vacuum, trapped in an endless, nightmarish \"Groundhog Day\" from which there is no escape. But the reality is far more painful.\n\nThe majority of Palestinians in Gaza have already been violently displaced ‒ not once but multiple times. Most are refugees or the descendants of refugees who were ethnically cleansed in the 1948 Nakba from their towns and villages in the greater Gaza district of historic Palestine. They have been denied their right to return to their homes and are now threatened with renewed expulsion.\n\nGrowing up as a stateless Palestinian in Saudi Arabia, my mother worked tirelessly to maintain our Palestinian residency status by making regular visits to Gaza, safeguarding our identity status and our right to return home.\n\nMany of our relatives were not so fortunate ‒ denied homeland after Israel’s occupation in 1967. In the same vein, my family who have survived Israel’s most recent onslaught in Gaza say they would rather die in the rubble of their homes than be forced to leave. Never did we imagine that within our lifetime, we would witness an open declaration to eradicate our society and ethnically cleanse what remains of our people.\n\nMore than 100 years after the Balfour Declaration in 1917 that established a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and decades of Palestinians struggling for their freedom and rights, we are now witnessing yet another overt act of dispossession, with Trump's proposal to remove Palestinians from Gaza and place it under U.S. control. It's a blatant effort to strip people of their land and sovereignty, mirroring that same colonial theft that continues till this day, but with even more audacity and disregard for the Palestinian people who have lived there for generations.\n\nTrump’s plan must be forcefully rejected by the international community, for the sake of Palestinians in Gaza, and for what little remains of the rules-based order.\n\nLaila El-Haddad is a Palestinian American Writer and author from Gaza.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/08"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955953/the-pros-and-cons-of-nato", "title": "The pros and cons of Nato | The Week", "text": "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) closer together, but it has also highlighted the alliance’s limitations.\n\nSince it was created in 1949, Nato has expanded from 12 founding members to 30, including several former Soviet states. The Ukraine conflict is fuelling debate about whether this expansion has provoked Russian president Vladimir Putin and whether the alliance can fulfil its main purpose of guaranteeing freedom and security to its members.\n\n1. Pro: peace in Europe\n\nThe objective of Nato when it was founded after the Second World War was to “secure peace in Europe, to promote cooperation among its members and to guard their freedom”. Members are committed to finding a peaceful resolution to disputes – and, for more than 70 years, there have been no major pan-European wars. However, last week, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg declared that peace on the continent had been “shattered” by the Russia-Ukraine war, which was “on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history”.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber.

Con: testing enemies\n\nPutin has long warned that further Nato expansion eastwards would be met with resistance by Russia as it is seen as a direct threat to his country. “That perspective isn’t held just by Russians; some influential American foreign policy experts have subscribed to it as well,” wrote Ronald Suny, professor of history and political science at the University of Michigan, for The Conversation. Leaders such as Putin “who feel cornered and ignored may strike out”, said Suny. “Paradoxically, Nato has endangered small countries on the border of Russia, as Georgia learned in 2008, that aspire to join the alliance.”\n\n3. Pro: protection for allies\n\nAt the heart of the founding treaty of Nato is collective defence: “an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies”. Although Nato’s 30 members are almost entirely European, this “all-for-one defense pledge” has been “invoked just once”, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US, said The Washington Post. Nevertheless, it serves as a deterrent. Experts such as Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, believe it is unlikely Putin would launch an attack on a Nato ally. If he did, Kupchan told ABC News, he would be looking at a “full-scale war”. Indeed, US President Joe Biden this week reiterated that “the United States will defend every inch of Nato territory with the full force of American power”.\n\n4. Con: drawn into conflict\n\nThe flip side of the collective defence pledge, which comes under Article 5 of the treaty, means that members may reluctantly be forced to join a conflict if another ally comes under attack. In the current crisis, that means “Article 5 could mandate a more direct response from the US and other treaty members if Russian aggression escalates beyond Ukraine”, which shares borders with four Nato members, said ABC News. Kupchan, from the Council on Foreign Relations, said that aggression could be “by design or by accident”, such as an artillery shell or a missile landing in Poland or another Nato neighbour. Mary Elise Sarotte, a professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, told NPR that she didn’t think many Americans understand this. “We are obliged to treat an attack on Estonia as if it were an attack on Chicago,” she said. “So, if there is an Article 5 incursion, this could very quickly become not Ukraine’s war, but our war.”\n\n5. Pro: promoting democracy\n\nNato was founded with a commitment to promote democratic values, although whether this works in reality has been hotly debated. Its criteria for new members includes “a functioning democracy based on a market economy, fair treatment of minority populations and a commitment to resolve conflicts peacefully”, said Bloomberg. One study, published in the Democracy and Security journal after the alliance’s 2004 expansion to the east of Europe, concluded that the “‘carrot’ of Nato membership can indeed spread democracy to prospective members”. Others note that there has since been creeping authoritarianism by Turkey, a member since 1952. Writing for the Brookings Institution, Kemal Kirişci and Ilke Toygür argued that this “democratic backsliding among Nato members is not unique to Turkey, and all cases pose a difficult challenge for the organisation”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n6. Con: the 2% target\n\nIn 2006, Nato members agreed to spend a minimum of 2% of their GDP on defence to ensure the alliance’s “military readiness”. This was not legally binding and the majority of members failed to meet the target. Another commitment made in 2014 gave members a decade to hit the benchmark, but policymakers knew this would be “unachievable for many”, wrote Derek Chollet, Steven Keil and Christopher Skaluba for the Atlantic Council. The discrepancies between ally spending led to bitter complaints from Donald Trump in 2018, when he denounced his allies as “delinquent” and suggested they should be paying double. Even in 2021, two-thirds of Nato members are not spending 2%, although Germany has just promised to increase its defence spending in the wake of the war in Ukraine. Chollet, Keil and Skaluba said the benchmark has “undermined Alliance credibility and solidarity”, with the failure of members to live up to the pledge a “black eye to NATO’s public image”. Others, such as Andrew A. Michta at 1945, argue that the 2% target is also “meaningless without looking at the structure of individual defence budgets” and whether they are fit for purpose.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/15/trump-executive-order-federal-agencies-funding-cut/82448071007/", "title": "Trump cuts funding for federal agencies with executive order", "text": "March 15, 2025 Updated March 18, 2025, 10:02 a.m. ET\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making more federal cuts, this time targeting an international media organization, public libraries, and homelessness reduction.\n\nAn executive order signed by the president on Friday March 14 slashes funding to seven federal agencies: the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, U.S. Agency for Global Media, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, Institute of Museum and Library Services, U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, Community Development Financial Institutions Fund and Minority Business Development Agency.\n\nIn protest of the order, the American Library Association released a statement that encourages the president to reconsider his \"short-sighted decision.\"\n\n\"By eliminating the only federal agency dedicated to funding library services, the Trump administration’s executive order is cutting off at the knees the most beloved and trusted of American institutions and the staff and services they offer,\" the statement reads, citing examples of summer reading programs for kids, braille books for readers with visual impairments and small business support for entrepreneurs.\n\nHere's what to know about each of the agencies.\n\nWhy is Trump cutting funding for these agencies?\n\nAs outlined by the executive order, Trump selected these seven agencies as he determined them \"unnecessary.\"\n\nA White House Fact Sheet outlines that the Department of Government Efficiency, the federal advisory agency led by billionaire Elon Musk, identified the agencies worth slashing.\n\n\"Cutting these governmental entities will save taxpayer dollars, reduce unnecessary government spending, and streamline government priorities,\" the fact sheet states.\n\nThe Trump administration did not immediately respond for comment about the order when contacted by USA TODAY on Saturday.\n\nWhat is the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service?\n\nThe Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service provides conflict management services for enhancing labor-management relationships. The independent federal agency provides training, mediation, facilitation, dispute systems design and other resolution services to federal agencies, according to its website.\n\nAn example of the agency's work includes, if an agency and union have negotiated over a particular subject and have not been able to reach a mutual decision, the parties may seek assistance from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, according to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n\nThe Mediation and Conciliation Service was established in 1947.\n\nWhat is the US Agency for Global Media?\n\nThe U.S. Agency for Global Media oversees all U.S. non-military, international broadcasting. The agency operates six networks: Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Open Technology Fund.\n\nAcross these six networks, the agency provides news in 64 languages to more than 427 million people, according to its website.\n\n\"President Trump is delivering on his promise to make our government more efficient.

In 2024, the institute awarded $266.7 million to museums, libraries and archives throughout the country.\n\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Services was established in 1996.\n\nWhat is the US Interagency Council on Homelessness?\n\nThe U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness coordinates a federal response to homelessness, working to create partnerships with government agencies and in the private sector, according to the agency's website. The council works with 19 federal organizations in an effort to end homelessness, including the Department of Education, Department of Defense, Department of Transportation and Department of Labor.\n\nThe U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness was established in 1987 by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.\n\nWhat is the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund?\n\nPart of the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund promotes economic revitalization and community development in underserved communities throughout the country.\n\nFor example, the fund's Community Development Financial Institutions Program provides loans, investments, financial services and technical assistance to institutions in these communities.\n\nThe Community Development Financial Institutions Fund was established in 1994 under the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act.\n\nWhat is the Minority Business Development Agency?\n\nThe Minority Business Development Agency aims to promote growth among Minority Business Enterprises, or MBEs, by providing technical assistance programs.\n\nAn MBE is a for-profit business that is at least 51% owned or managed by a qualifying minority group. To be qualified, a person must be a U.S. resident who is Asian-Indian, Asian-Pacific, Black, Hispanic or Native America, according to the National Minority Supplier Development Council.\n\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, the Minority Business Development Agency facilitated $1.5 billion worth of capital to MBEs and helped create 19,000 jobs, according to the agency's website.\n\nThe Minority Business Development Agency was founded in 1969 when President Richard Nixon established the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to fix a typo.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

This is not an exhaustive list, as the President signed more than 40 executive orders on his first day in office.\n\nYou can access the full list of executive orders that Trump signed, with full descriptions of what they aim to do, on the White House’s website underneath the “Presidential Actions” tab.\n\nCan the Supreme Court overturn an executive order?\n\nYes, the Supreme Court can overturn an executive order if the court deems it unconstitutional.\n\n“The complex role of the Supreme Court in this system derives from its authority to invalidate legislation or executive actions which, in the Court's considered judgment, conflict with the Constitution,” The Supreme Court’s website says.\n\nHow do you format an executive order?\n\nHere’s a template for how executive orders are formatted, to help you read the original executive orders on the White House website.\n\nThis template isfrom the American Bar Association:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/government/2025/02/06/usaid-turmoil-may-bankrupt-business-with-kansans-helping-disabled-kids/78251661007/", "title": "Without USAID funding, Kansans who help children with disabilities ...", "text": "Feb. 6, 2025, 5:13 a.m. ET\n\nInclusive Development Partners, a company that supports students with disabilities internationally, faces bankruptcy after losing funding from closure of USAID.\n\nThe company's 14 U.S. employees, including two in Kansas, have been furloughed.\n\nThe closure of USAID, spearheaded by Elon Musk and supported by President Trump, is based on allegations of waste and the promotion of \"woke\" ideologies.\n\nThe situation highlights potential consequences of USAID's closure, including job losses for Americans.\n\nAfter losing its federal funding following the Trump administration's dismantling of the foreign aid agency, a business that helps students with disabilities is on the verge of bankruptcy and has furloughed its Kansas employees.\n\nInclusive Development Partners is co-owned by Anne Hayes, of Overland Park, and has worked in 25 countries around the world to include learners with disabilities in education programs. But that work has now stopped with the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk.\n\n\"We're trying not to go bankrupt,\" Hayes told The Capital-Journal. \"We are not being paid the money of which we did even before the stop work order. So we're owed tens of thousands of dollars that no one's paying us. When they stopped USAID, they didn't pay them for any of the work they've done up until that point.\"\n\nAll 14 staff of Inclusive Development Partners across the country have been furloughed, including two in Kansas, and they are now seeking unemployment benefits. They have also terminated or placed on unpaid leave eight international staff members.\n\n\"We have about 100 different consultants that we've worked with that obviously are not being paid as well,\" Hayes said, adding that many of whom are either professors or graduates of the University of Kansas.\n\nThe company, which hasn't been paid for work it did in December and January, has no legal recourse against the federal government, Hayes said. It is a subrecipient of larger organizations that have the direct grant agreements with USAID, which likewise have not been paid.\n\n\"I'm not a radical lunatic, as Trump said. I'm somebody who has dedicated my entire professional life to helping kids with disabilities,\" Hayes said. \"I don't understand how this is bad.\"\n\nWhat are Trump and Musk doing to USAID?\n\nThere have been conflicting messages from the federal government about the future of USAID, the main federal agency that handles foreign aid.\n\nThe USAID website is no longer operational, instead displaying a message that almost all employees are being placed on administrative leave.\n\nMusk, who leads Trump's informal Department of Government Efficiency, has said the president agreed with his plan to shut down USAID, even though the administration doesn't have congressional approval to close the agency.\n\nMusk called USAID \"beyond repair\" and \"hopeless,\" USA TODAY reported. Then, in a post on X, Musk said, \"We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.\" He also said called USAID \"evil,\" a \"criminal organization\" and said it is \"time for it to die.\"\n\nTrump called USAID \"corrupt.\"\n\n\"It's been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we're getting them out,\" Trump said.\n\nIn a statement alleging waste at USAID, the White House listed examples like \"diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces,\" a \"DEI musical\" in Ireland and \"LGBT activism\" in Guatemala.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said he is now the acting administrator of USAID.\n\n\"This is not about ending the programs that USAID does, per se,\" Rubio said, adding, \"There are things that it does that are good and there are things that it does that we have strong questions about.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Topeka earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, alleged that USAID has been plagued by waste, fraud and abuse. He said that \"it's very good to take a pause on all of our money that we're sending outside of this country.\"\n\nWhat does attack on DEI mean for children with disabilities?\n\nThe federal government messaging provides little clarity to Inclusive Development Partners.\n\n\"We don't even know if it comes back,\" Hayes said. \"Which is questionable if it'll come back, unless Senate finally acts. And we need Republicans to act, not just the Democrats. I reached out to (Sen. Jerry) Moran's office and to (Sen. Roger) Marshall's office, and I've gotten no feedback.\n\n\"We're unsure if disability will no longer be tolerated and special education for kids with disabilities will be tolerated moving forward.\"\n\nNick Hoekstra, of Lawrence, was a senior program manager at Inclusive Development Partners.\n\n\"None of us have any idea how long this will last; if we'll ever have a job again in this field,\" Hoekstra said.\n\nThe company has received limited communication since the changes at the federal government.\n\nThey have been sent stop work orders from USAID. They have also been sent a DEIA waiver to sign.\n\nThe waiver, which references an executive order by Trump, requires certification that \"all activities to promote 'diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility' (DEIA) funded by the above referenced sub-grant funds have ceased.\"\n\n\"We've had two projects that have been fully terminated because they had the words 'diversity' and 'inclusion' in them,\" Hayes said.\n\n\"It's this myth of diversity, equity, inclusion, or projects being woke,\" Hoekstra said. \"These are vague terms that are not being defined. We don't even know what the current administration is targeting, what they're looking for. The work that I did primarily focused on students with disabilities, and I have not heard anything that we should stop making an effort to include students with disabilities, but yet it's being lumped in with everything else.\"\n\nHow USAID funds help students with disabilities get an education\n\nHayes, who is the executive director of Inclusive Development Partners, previously worked for USAID as a disability specialist. After having a child with a disability, she went into consulting and moved back to Kansas to be closer to family.\n\nShe said they filled a gap in foreign aid when she and a co-founder started IDP, which is headquartered in New Hampshire. Over the past five years, the company has grown to have worked in 25 countries, where, \"We primarily break down barriers to get kids with disabilities into school,\" Hayes said.\n\n\"We train teachers that disability isn't a sin and it's not contagious, and they should be in the classroom and they can learn,\" Hayes said. \"We've trained teachers that you have to teach sign language to people who are deaf, and they will not learn if you speak to them. We have worked with families to say you shouldn't be ashamed of your child. They have a right to education.\"\n\nTheir work helped to combat poverty.\n\n\"About 90% of kids with disabilities around the world, especially in lower income countries, are not in school and often are hidden away at home,\" she said. \"We're doing research right now in the World Bank to show the impact that that has on economies when mothers of children with disabilities are unable to work.\"\n\nLast year, they opened regional field offices in Nepal and Kenya.\n\n\"We've done policy reform in Malawi,\" she said. \"We're working on determining prevalence rates in Ethiopia. ... We were working in northern Nigeria to do informal education programs so that kids who were impacted by Boko Haram can still go to school, and so that kids with disabilities in those areas can also go to school.\"\n\nNow, the schools in northern Nigeria have been shut down.\n\nHoekstra worked on projects in multiple countries, particularly in Latin America. He was recently in Africa, helping university teachers and students learn how they can teach students with disabilities.\n\n\"Just two months ago I was in Liberia,\" Hoekstra said, \"where students were telling us directly about how important the work that we were doing was to them, in terms of preparing them to work with students with disabilities, making them feel more empowered in their own teaching.\"\n\nHoekstra, who is blind, said he entered this field after living abroad and observing that students with disabilities elsewhere in the world did not have the same opportunities he did in the United States.\n\n\"That was something I really wanted to dedicate my life to: How can I, as an individual with a disability, improve the education of students with disabilities around the world?\" he said. \"Through the work at USAID, that is something I've been able to do.\"\n\nHe said it has been impactful for him, as a person with a disability, to do this work.\n\n\"Some of these teachers have looked at students with disabilities and never expected that they had a future, and then they see someone like me,\" Hoekstra said. \"Here is a professional with a disability, and this person has been blind since they were a child. It gives them hope — not only individuals with disabilities who I've met, but also the teachers that teach students with disabilities.\"\n\nWhy IDP says foreign aid benefits America\n\nCritics of USAID contend that foreign aid is not beneficial to the United States, or at least, as Marshall said, \"Let's make America first again.\"\n\n\"The idea that USAID is just helping those abroad is sort of a fallacy,\" Hayes said. \"It keeps us safer. It limits migration. Lots of parents that don't have special education services in their own countries come to the U.S., it's to seek those. So if we can build up the services there for a minimum amount of money, they don't come to the U.S.\n\n\"Needless to say, the issues of health and what that's going to mean. We know from COVID the impacts of health is not domestic, it's global. So what happens when HIV/AIDS raises again?

His testimony could also further complicate the legal battle over Twitter’s agreement to be acquired by billionaire Elon Musk, and comes on the same day that Twitter shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal.\n\nIn a whistleblower disclosure sent to multiple lawmakers and government agencies in July, Zatko accused Twitter of failing to safeguard users’ personal information and of exposing the most sensitive parts of its operation to too many people, including potentially to foreign spies. Zatko — who was Twitter’s head of security from November 2020 until he was fired in January — also alleged company executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, have deliberately misled regulators and the company’s own board about its shortcomings.\n\nTwitter has criticized Zatko and broadly defended itself against the allegations, saying the disclosure paints a “false narrative” of the company. A company spokesperson said Zatko was fired for “ineffective leadership and poor performance.” Zatko himself contended in his disclosure that he was fired in retaliation for raising concerns about security vulnerabilities and purported misrepresentations by Twitter executives to its board.\n\nNews of the disclosure quickly prompted lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere to announce they’d be investigating his claims. Zatko has briefed some members of Congress behind closed doors, but his Tuesday testimony marks lawmakers’ first chance to publicly push Zatko to disclose more about what he witnessed at the company.\n\n“Mr. Zatko’s allegations of widespread security failures and foreign state actor interference at Twitter raise serious concerns,” Sens. Dick Durbin and Chuck Grassley, chair and ranking Republican of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement last month announcing the hearing.\n\nLawmakers are likely to zero in on Twitter’s alleged missteps in protecting user data, as well as Zatko’s claims the company is vulnerable to exploitation by foreign governments and that it may even now have foreign spies on its payroll. Zatko has also alleged Twitter is in violation of its 2011 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission, a claim that, if found to be true, could result in billions of dollars in fines for the company. Twitter’s top executives could also be held accountable if it’s proven they were knowingly responsible for any violations.\n\nMusk, who is currently fighting Twitter in court to get out of a $44 billion acquisition deal, is also likely to be closely watching Zatko’s testimony. Musk’s legal team on Friday sent a third letter to Twitter seeking to terminate the deal, claiming that a purported $7.75 million payment made to Zatko in June, prior to his whistleblower disclosure, violated the company’s obligations in the acquisition contract. The letter claimed that the payment was revealed in a court filing by Twitter earlier this month. Twitter hit back Monday calling Musk’s letter “invalid and wrongful” and saying that it has not violated the deal.\n\nAny legal obligations Zatko may be under do not preclude him from making disclosures to lawmakers and law enforcement agencies, according to Whistleblower Aid, the organization providing Zatko’s legal representation.\n\nWhistleblower Aid also represented Frances Haugen, the former Facebook employee who blew the whistle on that social media giant last year. Her disclosures prompted numerous Congressional hearings, bill proposals and changes by the company.\n\nOn Wednesday, the day after Zatko will testify, current and former Twitter officials are expected to appear before a different Senate panel to testify about social media’s impact on national security. Zatko’s allegations against Twitter could figure prominently in that hearing as well, further focusing Washington’s attention on the embattled company.\n\nA whistleblower with experience on Capitol Hill\n\nZatko is no stranger to Capitol Hill. In 1998, Zatko appeared before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee as part of a panel of ethical hackers who urgently told Congress that the technology used to access the internet was not secure. “If you’re looking for computer security, then the internet is not the place to be,” Zatko warned lawmakers at the time.\n\nNow, almost a quarter-century later, Zatko is returning to the Capitol to again warn about alleged insecurities in one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. Zatko, who worked at the US Department of Defense and Google before joining Twitter, is said to have a knack for explaining complex security topics to corporate executives and other laypeople, according to multiple former colleagues. That skill could come in handy as he makes a public case against Twitter.\n\nAmong Zatko’s most explosive claims are allegations that roughly half of Twitter’s employees, including all of its engineers, have expansive access to the company’s live, active product, including actual user data. That’s unlike other major tech companies, he claims, where coding and testing occurs in special, segregated environments away from the services consumers use. Zatko also alleges that Twitter fails to reliably delete the data of users who cancel their accounts, in some cases because Twitter has lost track of the information. The alleged failures represent violations of Twitter’s 2011 FTC consent order, Zatko has claimed.\n\nTwitter has said that members of its engineering and product teams are authorized to access Twitter’s platform if they have a specific business justification for doing so, but that members of other departments — such as finance, legal, marketing, sales, human resources and support — cannot. Twitter has also said it’s created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts the company will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. But Twitter has declined to say whether it typically completes that process.\n\nZatko’s allegations also raise questions about Twitter’s ability to handle election-related threats ahead of the US midterm elections later this year.\n\nThe disclosure — which includes a copy of a third-party consulting firm’s 2021 report on Twitter’s efforts to address misinformation — accuses the company of having misaligned priorities between product and safety teams and a reactive approach to misinformation and platform manipulation. For its part, Twitter says it has “a cross-functional team around the globe that’s focused on curbing the spread of misinformation and fostering an environment conducive to healthy, meaningful conversation.”\n\nThe Musk factor\n\nZatko’s testimony — and any resulting action taken by lawmakers and regulators — could also have implications for the legal battle over Musk’s effort to pull out of the deal he struck to buy the company.\n\nZatko alleges that Twitter has misled Musk and the public about the number of bots on its platform — an issue that has become central to Musk’s effort to exit the deal. The other allegations in his disclosure also introduce new wild cards to the fight.\n\nLast week, a Delaware judge ruled that Musk could add to his claims in the case based on the whistleblower disclosure. Zatko was set to be deposed by Musk’s team on Friday.\n\nMusk claimed in a second letter attempting to terminate the acquisition deal last month that the whistleblower’s claims, if true, would constitute additional justification that should allow him to exit the agreement. In the letter, Musk’s team claimed that inquiries by Congress and other foreign agencies could materially harm the company. Musk first moved to terminate the deal with Twitter in July.\n\nTwitter pushed back against Musk’s letter, saying it is “based solely on statements made by a third party that, as Twitter has previously stated, are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context.” The company reiterated that it intends to close the deal at the agreed upon price and terms.\n\nMusk and Twitter are set to go to trial over the deal in October, after the judge denied Musk’s request to delay the proceedings following Zatko’s disclosure.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Brian Fung", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/955281/rise-and-fall-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes", "title": "The rise and fall of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes | The Week", "text": "Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is facing up to 20 years in prison after being convicted of defrauding investors following a three-month trial.\n\nA California jury found Holmes guilty of two counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, after seven days of deliberation. Prosecutors had accused the former Silicon Valley tycoon of knowingly lying about technology that she claimed could detect a range of diseases with just a few drops of blood.\n\nHolmes attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of investment before her “once-feted start-up collapsed”, in “perhaps the biggest scandal of corporate America’s modern age”, said The Times.\n\nThe Week Escape your echo chamber.

Her father’s great-great grandfather founded Fleischmann's Yeast, which revolutionised America's bread industry.\n\nA Stanford University drop-out, she founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19. The then “darling of Silicon Valley”, Holmes was “articulate, confident and good at presenting a vision – a mission as she described it – to revolutionise diagnostics”, said the BBC’s North America technology reporter James Clayton.\n\nForbes described her as “the world's youngest self-made female billionaire”, while business magazine Inc. hailed her in a cover story as “the next Steve Jobs”.\n\nWhat was Theranos?\n\nValued at $9bn (£6.5bn) at one point, Theranos attracted high-profile backers including Rupert Murdoch by promising to revolutionise the healthcare industry by testing for hundreds of diseases with a pin prick of blood.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIntroducing Holmes at a conference in September 2015, Bill Clinton declared that her investors’ futures were “in good hands”.\n\nBut Holmes’ bold claims began to unravel just weeks later, when The Wall Street Journal published the findings of an investigation that suggested the core blood-testing technology did not work. Although investors had “poured more than $400m” into Theranos, the company was struggling “behind the scenes to turn the excitement over its technology into reality”, the paper said.\n\nEmployees past and present were reported to be “leery” about the accuracy of the testing device developed by Theranos, with one staffer claiming that the firm was “failing to report test results that raised questions about the precision”.\n\nThe allegations triggered panic among investors and by 2018, Theranos had collapsed.\n\nThe rise and fall of Holmes and her former business has since been tracked in documentaries, books and podcasts, and also inspired upcoming television series The Dropout, starring Amanda Seyfried.\n\nSilicon Valley culture\n\nAs Holmes’ trial drew to a close in December, The Verge said that “many questions have surfaced about what – or who – enabled Theranos to rise to such heights”.\n\nGiving testimony in court, Holmes accused her former business partner and lover, Sunny Balwani, of having abused her and influenced her to commit fraud.\n\nBalwani is due to go on trial next month on the same charges that Holmes faced. Both of the former Theranos bosses pleaded not guilty.\n\nHolmes’ trial “laid bare the pitfalls of one of the go-to moves of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs – conveying a boundless optimism regardless of whether it’s warranted, known as ‘fake it ‘til you make it’”, said ABC News. But “few expect her conviction to lower the wattage on the brash promises and bold exaggerations that have become a routine part of the tech industry’s innovation hustle”.\n\nEllen Kreitzberg, a Santa Clara University law professor who attended the trial, told the broadcaster that although the guilty verdict “will send a message to CEOs that there are consequences in overstepping the bounds”, would-be investors “are still going to want to make more money on a promising idea”.\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told The Guardian that “attorneys are going to be advising their clients to be more careful, especially in what they say to investors”.\n\nWhether Holmes’ conviction significantly changes Silicon Valley culture remains to be seen. But “considering how difficult white-collar fraud cases are to prosecute”, the US government “will be happy with what stuck” in her trial, said the BBC’s Clayton.\n\n“The verdict sends a clear and frank message to Silicon Valley founders,” he added. “There are consequences when you say things to investors that aren't true.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/business/ftx-collapse-senate-hearing", "title": "US lawmakers want answers from FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried - CNN", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nLawmakers are demanding that Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, appear before the Senate Banking Committee next week over “significant unanswered questions ” surrounding the collapse of his companies.\n\nIn a letter to Bankman-Fried and his lawyer, the committee’s Democratic chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania wrote that the American people need answers about Bankman-Fried’s “misconduct” leading to the collapse of FTX and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, both of which filed for bankruptcy on November 11.\n\n“You must answer for the failure of both entities that was caused, at least in part, by the clear misuse of client funds and wiped out billions of dollars owed to over a million creditors,” the senators wrote.\n\nIt wasn’t clear whether Bankman-Fried would comply. A representative for his attorney referred to Bankman-Fried’s tweet on Sunday in which he told Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, that he couldn’t commit to testifying at a hearing scheduled for December 13, one day before the Senate committee’s hearing. “Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain,” Bankman-Fried wrote. “I’m not sure that will happen by the 13th.”\n\nCongress seeks answers\n\nBrown and Toomey said in their letter that the committee would “consider further action if he does not comply.”\n\nSenators Sherrod Brown and Pat Toomey Tom Williams/Pool/Reuters\n\n“There are still significant unanswered questions about how client funds were misappropriated, how clients were blocked from withdrawing their own money, and how you orchestrated a cover up.”\n\nSeparately, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota, both Democrats, sent letters to three regulators – the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency – asking them to assess the traditional banking system’s exposure to turmoil in the crypto space, a largely unregulated, parallel financial system.\n\n“Crypto firms may have closer ties to the banking system than previously understood,” Warren and Smith wrote. “Banks’ relationships with crypto firms raise questions about the safety and soundness of our banking system and highlight potential loopholes that crypto firms may try to exploit to gain further access.”\n\nInvestigating FTX\n\nFederal prosecutors are investigating the collapse of FTX, an exchange that marketed itself as a beginner-friendly way to get involved in what was, until recently, a booming if highly volatile market for digital assets. FTX also facilitated high-risk leveraged trading that wasn’t allowed inside the United States. (The firm was based in The Bahamas.)\n\nFTX was one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world until last month, when it faced a sudden wave of customer withdrawals that it couldn’t cover. One of the key questions prosecutors are likely to probe is whether FTX misappropriated customer funds when it made loans to Alameda.\n\nBankman-Fried has denied accusations of misusing customer deposits. “I didn’t knowingly commingle funds,” he told The New York Times last week. “I was frankly surprised by how big Alameda’s position was.”\n\nFederal prosecutors are also investigating whether Bankman-Fried played a role in the collapse this spring of two interlinked cryptocurrencies, Terra and Luna, according to the New York Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Times said the issue is part of a broadening inquiry into the collapse of FTX, and it’s not clear whether prosecutors have determined any wrongdoing by Bankman-Fried.\n\nIn a statement to the paper, Bankman-Fried said he was “not aware of any market manipulation and certainly never intended to engage in market manipulation.”", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/09/trump-to-give-super-bowl-message-pledges-to-root-out-fraud-in-nation/78373612007/", "title": "Trump gives Super Bowl message, pledges Musk will probe Education", "text": "Updated Feb. 9, 2025, 10:32 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave the nation on Sunday a report of his first weeks in office, using his attendance at the Super Bowl to tout some of his priorities and make predictions - not just about the championship game but also what's ahead for the nation.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier that was taped at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, the president picked the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Philadelphia Eagles. He also said that he expects the changes that he's implemented since taking over the White House three weeks ago to continue.\n\nBefore 8 p.m. and the start of the third quarter, Trump had left, with the Chiefs trailing by 24 points.\n\nTrump told Baier in the seven-minute clip that he plans to direct tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is leading Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, to review the military and the Department of Education \"very soon.\"\n\n\"We're going to find hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse,\" he said.\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend the National Football League's title game.\n\nTrump arrives at Super Bowl\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrived at the Super Bowl, but reporters accompanying him said it wasn’t clear how many fans knew he was on the field because Philadelphia Eagles players were on Caesars Superdome’s large screens.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, Trump’s nominee to become director of national intelligence, was seated in the front row wearing an Eagles cap.

His daughter Ivanka stood next to him for the anthem.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's Super Bowl pick\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News he thinks both Super Bowl teams are great, but he picked the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Philadelphia Eagles because of quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\n“I’m a big fan of both teams,” Trump told Bret Baier. “They’re sort of different.”\n\nTrump praised Saquon Barkley of the Eagles as “one of the greatest running backs.”\n\nTrump said he hated to pick a winner. But without naming Mahomes, he said after seeing him win as many games as he has, Trump had to pick Kansas City.\n\n“The quarterback really knows how to win,” Trump said. “He’s a great, great quarterback.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nA blowout, and Trump has left the building\n\nPresident Donald Trump left the stadium a little before 8 p.m., according to reporters traveling with him. The Eagles were leading the Chiefs, the team Trump picked to win, by a wide margin.\n\nA man with the Palestinian flag got onto the field at Caesars Superdome during halftime but was tackled by security, according to reporters.\n\nTrump spent the first half of the game mainly seated in the front row of his box next to his daughter, Ivanka, according to reporters who accompanied him. Visitors would stop by and chat with him and sometimes take pictures, according to the reporters.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nWhat did Travis Kelce say about Trump before Super Bowl?\n\nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce told reporters this week that it is \"pretty cool\" that Trump will attend the game on Sunday.\n\n\"That’s awesome. It’s a great honor,\" he said, according to videos posted by multiple media outlets Wednesday. \"I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, you know, it’s the best country in the world.

Burgum said staffers at his department are contacting map apps from Google and Apple to have the name changed.\n\nHowever, the change could take months to enact and may or may not be immediately reflected on the digital maps Americans use daily.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump steel tariffs: President to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Sunday he will impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday and announce “reciprocal” tariffs the next day.\n\nTrump made the remarks aboard Air Force One on his way to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nThe moves come after Trump had previously promised tariffs on metals and other goods such as microchips and pharmaceuticals. Trump on Friday said he would impose “reciprocal” tariffs that would affect all countries.\n\nTrump described the “reciprocal” approach as tariffs that would be applied to imports from other countries if they place tariffs on U.S. exports. “If they charge us, we charge them,” Trump said.\n\nLast week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, only to hold off on the tariffs after leaders of both countries agreed on efforts to reenforce their borders with the U.S.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCBS poll finds 53% approval rating for Trump\n\nLess than one month into Trump’s second presidency, 7 in 10 Americans say he is following through on his campaign promises, according to a new CBS News/YouGov survey.\n\nWith a 53% job approval rating, the poll of 2,175 U.S. adults found Trump draws overall majority support for some of his actions on immigration and the war in Gaza. But 66% say he hasn’t focused enough on lowering prices, and most Americans don’t approve of new tariffs except on goods from China.\n\nAbout 60% agree with Trump’s program to deport unauthorized immigrants and with sending troops to the southern border, the poll found. But a slight majority of respondents oppose holding people in mass detention centers while authorities determine who should be deported.\n\nTrump’s newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which he has tapped tech billionaire Elon Musk to head, draws mixed support. Nearly a third of respondents say Musk and DOGE should have zero influence on government operations and spending, while 23% say they should have “a lot” of influence. Support for DOGE is driven by Republicans, the poll found.\n\n- Minnah Arshad\n\nTrump says he trusts Elon Musk to cut spending\n\nTrump told Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that he trusts Elon Musk, his head of the Department of Government Efficiency, to find ways to cut federal spending and will turn the spotlight on the Education Department and the Pentagon next.\n\nMusk has been criticized for sending staffers to gather sensitive information at government agencies and he blocked temporarily in court from gaining access to secure systems at the Treasury Department. But Trump said he asked Musk for the help and will ask him to review Education and Defense next.\n\n“I've had a great help with Elon Musk, who's been terrific,” Trump told Bret Baier of Fox News. “Trust Elon? Oh, he's not gaining anything. In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. He's so into it. But I told him do that.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump disagreed with court blocking Musk access to Treasury\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News he has to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, so it was a mistake for a federal judge to block Elon Musk’s access to Treasury Department systems looking for problems.\n\n“I disagree with it 100%,” Trump told Bret Baier of the ruling. “I think it’s crazy.”\n\nTrump argued that hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on the wrong priorities. He said he would move funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development to the State Department, for example.\n\n“I think I’d rather give it to Marco Rubio over at the State Department, let him take care of the few good” programs, Trump said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump doubles down on desire to annex Canada\n\nDuring an interview with Fox, Baier asked Trump whether his desire to make Canada the 51st state was real.\n\nTrump reaffirmed that, saying: “We lose 200 billion dollars a year with Canada and I'm not gonna let that happen.\"\n\nCanada would “be much better off being a 51st state,” he said. “Why are we paying 200 billion dollars a year essentially in subsidy to Canada? Now, if they’re a 51st state I don't mind doing it.”\n\n- Minnah Arshad\n\nTrump says Canada, Mexico must take action to avoid tariffs\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Fox News he “got a lot of good action” from Canada and Mexico on border security after ordering 25% tariffs on goods from those countries, which he paused for 30 days, but he said more action was necessary.\n\n“No, it’s not good enough,” Trump told Bret Baier.\n\nTrump complained about a $200 billion U.S. trade deficit with Canada and a $350 billion trade deficit with Mexico that he said he wouldn’t allow to continue.\n\n“Something has to happen,” Trump said. “It’s not sustainable.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says 'just something special' about his dance at rallies\n\nOn a lighter note during the Fox News interview, Bret Baier asked President Donald Trump what he thought about UFC fighters and NFL players imitating his swaying and arm-waving dance from his political rallies.\n\nTrump often danced to the Village People’s “YMCA” at the end of his rallies. While perhaps not the same cultural touchstone as John Travolta’s dancing in “Saturday Night Fever,” the dance caught on among Trump’s followers.\n\n“I don't know what it is,” Trump said. “I try and walk off sometimes without dancing, and I can't but I have to dance because it's just that something special about it.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security promotes safety at Super Bowl\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security promoted a video on social media about safety measures it is taking to protect 100,000 people visiting New Orleans for the Super Bowl.\n\nSecurity has been enhanced in the weeks since a follower of ISIS drove a truck through a Bourbon Street crowd on New Year’s Day, killing 14 people and forcing a one-day postponement of the college Sugar Bowl in the same stadium, Caesars Superdome.\n\n“We have a big event coming on Sunday and we are committed to having a safe environment for everyone that attends,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in the video.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nSecret Service recruits at Super Bowl\n\nA Secret Service recruitment video to be played on the jumbotron during the big game chronicles how the agency has protected “the most important people and events” since 1901, including Super Bowl LIX.\n\nThe one-minute video features inspirational speeches from former Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

Clinton St. store announced Monday in a video posted to Twitter and TikTok that they had petitioned National Labor Relations Board to conduct the election. Starbucks Workers United, the main union representing Starbucks workers nationally, posted the video.\n\nThe unionization process starts when at least 30% of eligible workers at a workplace sign cards or a petition requesting to join a union. At that point the NLRB conducts an election. If a majority vote to form a union, the NLRB certifies it as the representative to collectively bargain on behalf of workers.\n\nEmployers also may voluntarily recognize unions. Under federal law, once a union is certified or recognized, an employer is required to bargain with it over terms and conditions of employment.\n\nThe NLRB filing said full-time and part-time baristas and shift supervisors will be included in the Iowa City union if it’s certified. Excluded would be other supervisors and the store managers.\n\nIn Monday’s video, employees from the Iowa City store said they are seeking a union to ensure consistent scheduling and ensure a better and safer work environment.\n\nEvie Roberts, an employee at the store, told The Daily Iowan that safety incidents have been an issue at the store.\n\n“We know what’s best for our health and safety and our customer’s health and safety so we’re trying to secure that,” Roberts was quoted as saying.\n\nAt least 293 of Starbucks’ 9,000 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late 2021. Starbucks Workers United has yet to reach a contract with the company for workers at any of those stores.\n\nStarbucks contends that it already provides some of the best pay and benefits in the industry and that stores work better when the company works directly with employees. In a statement, a Starbucks spokesperson noted that workers, called \"partners,\" in the company's parlance, have petitioned to start unions at less than 3% of Starbucks' U.S. stores. At stores where workers petition for union representation, Starbucks' \"focus is to ensure that they can trust the process is fair and their voice is heard,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We believe our direct relationship as partners is core to the culture and experiences we create in our stores,\" the statement said. \"Should partners at our Clinton Street store vote in favor of union representation, we look forward to meeting Workers United in-person to begin the single-store collective bargaining process.\"\n\nWorkers United representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIowa Restaurant Association head calls union push 'surprising'\n\nJessica Dunker, Iowa Restaurant Association president and CEO, said the Starbucks employees’ push to unionize is unexpected because the company has traditionally been seen as a company with good wages and benefits.\n\n“I’m a little surprised that’s where the energy is coming from,\" Dunker said. \"Obviously workers have the right to organize. It’s not something that we’re seeing widespread in the industry.\"\n\nHalf of U.S. residents get their first jobs in the restaurant industry, Dunker said. The industry also hires scores of people re-entering the workforce. Given the transient nature of the workforce outside management levels in restaurants, unions are not one of the top issues for restaurant employees, she said.\n\n\"So there isn't necessarily in most restaurants a big pool of people where this would be something that is top of mind,\" Dunker said.\n\nShe also said the issues employees at Starbucks want resolved are not problems at other food and beverage outlets in Iowa, where staff members are stretched thin because there are not enough people working, Dunker said.\n\n“Because of that restaurants are focusing hard on trying to take care of their staff,” Dunker said. “You’re seeing people take tables out of their restaurants. They’re closing an extra day because the people that they have, they need to keep fresh and happy and not burnt out.”\n\nFormer Starbucks CEO testifies before Sanders committee\n\nOn Wednesday, Howard Schultz, who has served as Starbucks CEO three times since 1986, testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, denying allegations that the company has illegally tried to subvert unionization.\n\nSchultz stepped down as interim CEO March 20 but remains on the Starbucks board of directors.\n\nA report from staff members for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who chairs the committee, said that in the 18 months Schultz was interim CEO in 2022 and 2023, Starbucks “waged an aggressive and illegal union-busting campaign.”\n\nEarlier this month an NLRB judge ruled the company had committed \"hundreds of unfair labor practices,\" including illegally disciplining and firing employees during unionization efforts at stores in the Buffalo, New York, area.\n\nSchultz in his testimony to the committee said Starbucks respects the right of its employees to unionize. However, he said, the company already provides good wages and benefits and does not need unions.\n\n“We've done everything that we possibly can to respect the right under the law of our partners' ability to join a union,” Schultz said. “But conversely, we have consistently laid out our preference, without breaking any law, of communicating to our people what we believe is our vision for the company.”\n\nA statement from Starbucks noted that over the past year the company raised its average wage to $17.50 per hour and allowed tipping on credit and debit card transactions. But Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, noted that the company refused to add those and other benefits at stores that have unionized. Schultz countered that they are subject to bargaining.\n\nSmith said labor organizers are seeking to address an imbalance of power within the company. Workers say Starbucks cuts their schedules with little notice, for example, pushing them below the minimum number of hours to qualify for benefits.\n\n“You're a billionaire and they are your employees. The imbalance is extreme,” Smith said.\n\nSanders, a vocal supporter of Starbucks labor organizers, accused the company of trying to stall the union drive.\n\n“The fundamental issue we are confronting today is whether we have a system of justice that applies to all, or whether billionaires and large corporations can break the law with impunity,” Sanders said.\n\nUSA Today and the Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nPhilip Joens covers retail, real estate and RAGBRAI for the Des Moines Register.

Those plans had raised questions about the potential impact on Twitter’s core ad sales business, as advertisers might flinch at having their paid posts appear alongside more controversial content.\n\nMusk’s letter appears aimed at quelling those fears, which could impact the company’s core business. Twitter generated $4.5 billion in advertising revenue in 2021, nearly 89% of its total sales.\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” he said in the Thursday post. “Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise … Let us build something extraordinary together.”\n\nMusk has previously said he would seek to allow all legal speech on Twitter. Content rules vary across the world. In Europe, the new Digital Services Act imposes high moderation standards. Musk in May said he is “exactly aligned” with the new law.\n\nThe letter is the latest indication that the billionaire Tesla CEO is nearing completion of the Twitter acquisition after months of trying to get out of the deal. On Wednesday, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters and spoke with employees, reportedly telling them he does not in fact plan to cut 75% of Twitter’s staff, despite prior reports.\n\nTwitter’s Chief Customer Officer Sarah Personette responded to Musk’s Thursday tweet saying that she had a “great discussion” with Musk on Wednesday. “Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remained unchanged,” Personette said. “Looking forward to the future!”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that one ad buying agency had already received requests from about a dozen clients to pause their advertisements on Twitter if Musk restores Trump’s account, and other were considering doing the same.\n\nMusk also reiterated in the letter a lofty earlier statement he had made that the Twitter acquisition is not meant to be a money-making venture for him.\n\n“The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,” Musk said.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that he wants to increase Twitter’s subscription revenue to rely less on ads.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/26/supreme-court-biden-social-media-decision-debate/74221889007/", "title": "Supreme Court social media case doesn't settle censorship debate", "text": "June 26, 2024 Updated June 27, 2024, 4:50 p.m. ET\n\nTwo years ago, the Republican attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri and a small number of social media users filed a lawsuit accusing the Biden administration officials of crossing the line when they leaned on social media platforms to suppress content they believed was false and dangerous, such as posts dealing with COVID-19 and election fraud.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected that challenge in a 6-3 ruling Wednesday, saying the states and the users did not suffer a direct injury from the back-channel communications and did not have standing to sue, doing little to settle the long-running debate over whether Big Tech colludes with Democrats to censor conservative viewpoints.\n\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill slammed the Supreme Court decision as a free pass to “the worst government coercion scheme in history.”\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey pledged to continue the legal fight.\n\n“The record is clear: the deep state pressured and coerced social media companies to take down truthful speech simply because it was conservative. Today’s ruling does not dispute that,” Bailey said in a statement.\n\nPolitical commentator Dan Schnur says social media censorship will remain a mainstream powder keg unless former President Donald Trump wins reelection or the Supreme Court revisits the First Amendment issues.\n\n“From a political standpoint, this doesn’t change anything at all,” said Schnur, who teaches at the University of California – Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies and the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communications. “There are certainly conservatives who will continue to fight on principle but, under a Trump administration, a lot of them would probably find other battles to weigh in on.”\n\nConservative complaints of online censorship still rage\n\nFrom legislation in GOP-led statehouses to lawsuits brought by Trump, Murthy v. Missouri was the latest conservative grievance against the Biden administration and powerful technology companies.\n\nConservatives say social media platforms violate their First Amendment rights when their posts are labeled or removed or when they are banned for violating company policies. Social media companies say they don't target conservatives, only harmful speech that violates their rules.\n\nResearchers say they’ve found no evidence to support GOP grievances that social media companies stifle conservative voices​​​​​. If anything, they say, social media platforms amplify the voices of conservatives, shaping the worldviews of millions of voters.\n\nThe perception that tech companies and the billionaire CEOs who run them are biased against conservatives intensified as Trump made “social media abuses” a major plank of his administration and his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nAfter he lost the presidency, Trump vilified tech companies for labeling or removing posts that spread falsehoods about the outcome of the election. He will square off with Biden on Thursday in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election.\n\nFor some conservatives, the 2020 election proved Big Tech's ideological bias. Their complaints only got louder when major social media platforms banned Trump following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and tech companies came under fire for throttling the spread of a New York Post article about Hunter Biden’s business dealings.\n\nSupreme Court cases consider suppression of right-wing views\n\nThis term, the debate landed on the Supreme Court docket. One set of cases yet to be decided involves state laws in Florida and Texas that would restrict how social media companies police content on their platforms.\n\nThose cases are “more directly relevant to the debate over whether social media chooses to censor conservative viewpoints,” said Duke Law School professor Stuart Benjamin.\n\nAt issue in Murthy v. Missouri was “jawboning,” the practice of trying to influence social media companies to delete a controversial post or change policies around public health misinformation.\n\nThe attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana claim those attempts by the Biden administration violated the First Amendment. Among the communications were tense conversations the administration had with Facebook’s parent company Meta and X, formerly Twitter, over the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nFederal judge Terry A. Doughty in the Western District of Louisiana sided with the plaintiffs, saying the pressure the Biden administration applied was “the most massive attack against free speech in United States’ history.”\n\nDoughty, appointed by President Donald Trump, issued an injunction imposing unprecedented restrictions on how government officials speak about matters of public concern, address national security threats or relay public health information.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit – two appointed by former President George W. Bush and one by Trump – narrowed the restrictions to a smaller number of government officials and agencies, but largely left the injunction intact.\n\nThe Biden administration filed an emergency application in September asking the Supreme Court to temporarily lift the injunction, saying that the government can urge companies to take action on issues of national security and public safety as long as those requests are not threats. The court granted the request and agreed to hear the case.\n\nSupreme Court dissent claims free speech violations\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said the decisions by social media companies to take down content could not be directly traced back to government influence.\n\n“While the record reflects that the Government defendants played a role in at least some of the platforms’ moderation choices, the evidence indicates that the platforms had independent incentives to moderate content and often exercised their own judgment,” she wrote.\n\nWednesday, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch, dissented.\n\n\"For months, high-ranking government officials placed unrelenting pressure on Facebook to suppress Americans’ free speech,\" Alito wrote.\n\nThe court is shirking its duty, he said, “and thus permits the successful campaign of coercion in this case to stand as an attractive model for future officials who want to control what the people say, hear and think.”\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/13/elon-musk-doge-confidential-data-access-conflicts/78394553007/", "title": "Elon Musk, DOGE may access personal info as part of cost cutting", "text": "Updated Feb. 13, 2025, 5:33 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – If you received a tax refund, Elon Musk could get your Social Security number and even your bank account and routing numbers.\n\nPaying off a student loan or a government-backed mortgage? Musk and his aides could dig through that data, too.\n\nIf you get a monthly Social Security check, receive Medicaid or other government benefits like SNAP (formerly known as food stamps), or work for the federal government, all of your personal information would be at the Musk team’s fingertips. The same holds true if you’ve been awarded a federal contract or grant.\n\nPrivate medical history could potentially fall under the scrutiny of Musk and his assistants if your doctor or dentist provides that level of detail to the government when asking Medicaid to reimburse him or her for the cost of your care.\n\nA large volume of information on the private lives of millions of Americans will be available to Musk and his associates unless the courts thwart the billionaire businessman from gaining access to the Treasury Department’s payment and data systems.\n\nThe amount of sensitive data that Musk and his team could access is so vast it has historically been off limits to all but a handful of career civil servants. Public interest groups say it should remain off limits and that Americans have the right to expect that private information entrusted to the government will remain private.\n\n“When Americans interface with the government, there's a law in place, a privacy law, that is supposed to foreclose people from seeing it or using it for anything but (processing) these payments,” said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. “And so it's incredibly problematic to think about an unelected billionaire and his team having access to it, being able to see it or change it.”\n\nA federal judge in New York temporarily blocked Musk and his team on Saturday from accessing government processing systems after attorneys general in 19 states filed suit. The states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, argue Musk and his assistants aren’t authorized to access the payment system, could jeopardize confidential information and could block federal funds to states for health clinics, preschools, climate initiatives, and other programs.\n\nAn outraged Musk responded to the ruling by posting a message on X, the social media platform he owns, calling the judge corrupt and saying he should be impeached.\n\nA hearing in the case is set for Friday.\n\nMusk is seeking access to the payment system as part of his stated push to eliminate government waste and inefficiency. President Donald Trump has put Musk in charge of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to carry out his campaign promise to slash government spending and regulations. Musk is an unpaid adviser to Trump, and DOGE isn’t really a government department but is instead an advisory team to the Trump administration.\n\nMusk hasn’t said why he wants access to the Treasury Department’s payment system, which distributes money on behalf of the entire federal government. In fiscal year 2023, the system paid out more than $5 trillion, or roughly 88% of all federal payments.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was appointed by Trump, gave representatives of Musk’s team access to the payment system a couple of weeks ago after facing resistance from a top Treasury official. The official, David Lebryk, a career civil servant, abruptly retired after the standoff.\n\nThe White House said Musk and his lieutenants have “read-only” access to information in the Treasury system. But the Treasury Department acknowledged in court documents filed Tuesday that one DOGE staff member had been mistakenly granted \"read/write\" permission on Feb. 5.\n\nThe staffer was identified as Marko Elez, a 25-year-old software engineer. The error was discovered the next day, and Elez's access was promptly changed to \"read-only,\" the court documents said. Elez wasn't aware that he had been given \"read/write\" permission, never used his \"write\" privileges and apparently never even logged into the system during that time, the documents said.\n\nElez later resigned after The Wall Street Journal unearthed racist messages he had posted on social media, although Musk has since said he had been reinstated after Trump and Vice President JD Vance came to his defense.\n\nPrivacy advocates and other experts say there is no reason why Musk and his team should have any access to the system.\n\n“The government paying its bills should be a nonpartisan thing,” said Don Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy. “There’s no reason why people doing government reform should need (access to) the system.”\n\nMusk and his team are looking to overturn more than 140 years of government precedent that began with the founding of the federal civil service system in 1883, said Max Stier, founding president and chief executive officer of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that focuses on improving government.\n\n“Since the 1880s, we’ve had a political consensus – Democrat, Republican and independent – that our government is going to provide the best service with a career civil service, and one that is nonpartisan and based on merit,” Stier said. “The process of overturning that 140 years has been done in an ugly way and in ways that are really hurting the people in government.”\n\nIn this case, “people won’t get vital money that they need for their lives, for their businesses – for everything,” he said.\n\nPotential for conflicts of interest\n\nDemocrats in Congress also have sounded the alarm.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, warned in a Feb. 7 letter to the Social Security Administrator’s acting commissioner, Michelle King, that the attempt by Musk’s team to access the payment system amounts to “a two-front invasion on Americans’ financial security and privacy.”\n\n“The information collected and housed at the agency could have significant commercial value as well as competitive advantage for individuals seeking to use it for financial gain,” Wyden said. “Likewise, it could be misappropriated to target American citizens and businesses for political or exploitative means.”\n\nMusk and his business interests, such as his aeronautics company Space X, have received billions of dollars in government contacts over the past decade, raising further concerns about granting him access to the payment system.\n\n“What if he decided not to disperse money to his competitors?” said Gilbert of Public Citizen, which also has sued to stop Musk from accessing the system. “The corrupting potential here is enormous.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Musk would recuse himself from any contracts or funding that might pose a conflict of interest.\n\nFeverishly gutting departments: 5 ways Elon Musk is working to dismantle the federal government\n\nInexperienced coders and artificial intelligence\n\nAnother factor raising alarms is that several members of Musk’s team carrying out his sweeping orders are young engineers such as Elez who are fresh out of college – one is reportedly a recent high school graduate – and have little or no government experience. Without that background, they may not fully appreciate the sensitive nature of private data or understand the consequences of mishandling it, Stier said.\n\n“You’re injecting people (into the government) who may be quite expert at coding but don’t know these systems, don’t know the consequences of things breaking and, very importantly, have not engaged with the people who do,” he said.\n\nThe Musk team’s suggestion that artificial intelligence could be used to help identify government waste is another reason for concern, several experts said, because of the absence of guardrails needed to protect against errors.\n\n“We do know that AI is prone to errors and also know that a lot of people who are building AI don’t know a lot about government,” Moynihan said. “And so there is a real risk of building a tool that has blind spots built into it.”\n\nGilbert said the use of AI raises additional fears about protecting privacy given how quickly and easily information identified through the use of such tools can be distributed.\n\n“The idea that it might be making decisions about who is worthy of payment is fairly terrifying,” she said.\n\nFollow Michael Collins on X @mcollinsNEWS.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/20/social-security-records-musk-doge-judge/82575042007/", "title": "Judge blocks Elon Musk's DOGE from accessing Social Security ...", "text": "Jack Queen and Tim Reid\n\nReuters\n\nMarch 20, 2025 Updated March 21, 2025, 8:59 a.m. ET\n\nA federal judge said on Thursday the Social Security Administration likely violated privacy laws by giving tech billionaire Elon Musk's aides \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, and ordered a halt to any further record sharing.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander of Maryland said Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was intruding into \"the personal affairs of millions of Americans\" as part of its hunt for fraud and waste under President Donald Trump.\n\nThe acting head of the SSA, Leland Dudek - who has been cooperating with DOGE - said the order blocking \"DOGE affiliates\" from the agency's systems was so broad it could apply to all staff, according to remarks reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\"My anti-fraud team would be DOGE affiliates. My IT staff would be DOGE affiliates,\" Dudek said. \"As it stands, I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems.\"\n\nDudek said he would ask the judge to clarify her order, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\"Really, I want to turn it off and let the courts figure out how they want to run a federal agency,\" he said.\n\nThe SSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Dudek's remarks.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Judge Hollander, in her ruling, said: \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so.\"\n\nThe case has shed light for the first time on the amount of personal information DOGE staffers have been given access to in the databases, which hold vast amounts of sensitive data on most Americans.\n\nThe SSA administers benefits for tens of millions of older Americans and people with disabilities, and is just one of at least 20 agencies DOGE has accessed since January.\n\nHollander said at the heart of the case was a decision by new leadership at the SSA to give 10 DOGE staffers unfettered access to the records of millions of Americans. She said lawyers for SSA had acknowledged that agency leaders had given DOGE access to a “massive amount” of records.\n\n\"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion. It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,\" Hollander said.\n\n'Crown jewels'\n\nOne of the systems DOGE accessed is called Numident, or Numerical Identification, known inside the agency as the \"crown jewels,\" three former and current SSA staffers told Reuters. Numident contains personal information of everyone who has applied for or been given a social security number.\n\nThursday's ruling is one of the most significant legal setbacks for DOGE to date. It comes two days after a federal judge ruled Musk's efforts to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development were likely illegal because he is not a Senate-confirmed cabinet official.\n\nDOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA White House spokesman criticized the decision in a statement and said Trump will \"continue to seek all legal remedies available to ensure the will of the American people goes into effect.\"\n\n\"This is yet another activist judge abusing the judicial system to try and sabotage the President’s attempts to rid the government of waste, fraud, and abuse,\" spokesman Harrison Fields said.\n\nJudges have declined to block DOGE from accessing computer systems at the departments of Labor, Health and Humans Services, Energy and others, although the team has been barred from accessing sensitive Treasury Department payment systems.\n\nThe two labor unions and an advocacy group that sued SSA, Musk, DOGE and others, said in their lawsuit the agency had been “ransacked” and that DOGE members had been installed without proper vetting or training and demanded access to some of the agency’s most sensitive data systems.\n\nThe advocacy group Democracy Forward said the ruling was an important win for data privacy.\n\n\"Today, the court did what accountability demands - forcing DOGE to delete every trace of the data it unlawfully accessed. The court recognized the real and immediate dangers of DOGE’s reckless actions and took action to stop it,\" Democracy Forward President and CEO Skye Perryman said in a statement.\n\nRecords to the 1930s\n\nMusk says that millions of people are using the identities of dead people to claim social security payments, or that checks are still being sent to people who died long ago.\n\nTwo of the former SSA officials told Reuters the names of millions of dead people are inside the main database because it contains records dating back to the agency's founding in the 1930s. But the fact they are listed in the systems does not mean they receive payments, the officials said.\n\n\"We will work to comply with the court order,\" said an SSA spokesperson, before Dudek's comments were reported.\n\nIn a statement on March 3, the SSA said it had identified over $800 million in cost savings for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\n“The SSA continues to make good on President Trump’s promise to protect American taxpayers from unnecessary spending,” it said in the earlier statement.\n\nThe information in SSA’s records includes Social Security numbers, personal medical and mental health records, driver’s license information, bank account data, tax information, earnings history, birth and marriage records, and employment and employer records, Judge Hollander said.\n\nHollander also noted that DOGE staffers had been granted anonymity in the proceeding due to fears for their safety.\n\n\"(The) defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,” the judge said.\n\n(This story has been updated with additional information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/02/16/layoffs-halted-cfpb-consumer-watchdog-musk-trump/78871464007/", "title": "Layoffs halted but consumer agency is still a Trump target - USA Today", "text": "Feb. 16, 2025, 1:43 p.m. ET\n\nThe Trump administration has agreed to pause layoffs and funding cuts at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, the federal agency responsible for cracking down on “junk” fees and answering consumer complaints in the finance industry.\n\nIn a Friday order, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Trump officials had agreed not to terminate workers, delete CFPB data or raid agency coffers, at least for now.\n\nIt’s the latest move in an unfolding drama over the fate of a high-profile federal watchdog agency that Trump has targeted for shutdown in the early days of his second presidency.\n\nThe judge’s order states that the Trump administration “shall not delete, destroy, remove, or impair any data or other CFPB records,” except as permitted by federal law. “It is further ordered that Defendants shall not terminate any CFPB employee, except for cause,” the order says.\n\nOn Feb. 1, Trump officials fired CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. They installed a new director, Russell Vought, who promptly ordered the agency to halt its work and shut its doors.\n\nElon Musk's message on agency's future: 'CFPB RIP'\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire tasked with slashing Beltway budgets, broadcast Trump’s evident intentions, and his own, in a Feb. 7 tweet that read, “CFPB RIP,” along with a tombstone emoji.\n\nThe CFPB was formed after the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from fraud. Modeled on an idea from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, the agency has drawn sharp criticism from leaders of the financial industry and, more recently, from the new Trump administration.\n\nIn a Feb. 8 post on X, a platform where much of the policy debate is playing out, Vought wrote that the CFPB’s funding was “excessive.” He added, “This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off.”\n\nBut Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, testified Tuesday that “no other federal regulator” exists to hold large banks accountable for following consumer protection rules.\n\nThe CFPB says it has put $17.5b back in consumer pockets\n\nIn a 2023 report, the CFPB said it had put a cumulative $17.5 billion “back in Americans’ pockets” in compensation, canceled debts and other consumer relief. Banking industry leaders counter that the agency has far exceeded its Congressional mandate.\n\nAmong recent CFPB actions:\n\nIn March 2024, the agency capped most credit card late fees at $8. The typical fee had been $32.\n\nIn December, the CFPB capped most bank overdraft fees at $5. The typical fee exceeded $25.\n\nIn January, the agency banned the inclusion of medical bills on credit reports, so people's medical debt won't count against them when they try to take out a loan.\n\nNow, the future of those initiatives is in limbo. Last week, Republican lawmakers introduced legislation to overturn the $5 cap on overdraft fees. They argued that higher fees “promote financial discipline and responsibility.”\n\nCFPB website message: 'Page not found'\n\nOn Sunday, the CFPB home page carried a message increasingly common on government websites: “404: Page not found.”\n\nAgency officials fired probationary workers in an email Tuesday, according to Government Executive, a publication that covers federal business. On Thursday, termination notices went out to workers on contracts, according to Reuters. Together, those employees number nearly 200, out of a 1,700-person CFPB workforce, according to The New York Times.\n\nAn employee union filed suit to challenge the shutdown. On Friday in court, attorneys said they feared agents of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency would remove years’ worth of valuable data.\n\nIn a court filing Friday, the agency’s former chief technologist, Erie Meyer, warned of an “imminent risk that twelve years’ of critical CFPB records, which belong to the public, will be irretrievably lost and cause serious and sweeping damage,” unless the court intervenes.\n\nThe judge’s order calls for no further firings, and no data purge, until at least March 3, the date of the next court hearing.\n\nIs the CFPB good or bad? Depends on your political party.\n\nReaction to the CFPB shutdown has broken largely along party lines.\n\nWith the agency shuttered, “Congress can put consumer protection laws back where it belongs – with real regulators – not Elizabeth Warren’s unchecked, unaccountable CFPB,” wrote Rep. Andy Barr, the Kentucky Republican, in a Feb. 12 post on X.\n\nThe next day, Warren tweeted a reference to a new payment platform Musk is said to be developing, X Money.\n\n“Guess which agency would be making sure that Elon’s new project couldn’t scam you or steal your sensitive personal data?” Warren wrote. “The CFPB.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/16"}]}

You can expect to see seven planets align Friday when Mercury joins Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Venus and Saturn.\n\nBut not all of them will be easy to see, especially with the naked eye. You'll need a good pair of high-powered binoculars or a telescope to see Uranus and Neptune.\n\nWhere to view the planetary alignment\n\nRegardless of how you're viewing them, the hardest planets to see will be Saturn and Neptune because they are close to the horizon and the sun, according to StarWalk. If you can see them, they'll be toward the west just after the sun sets. The time will vary based on your location. Mercury also should be visible in the western part of the sky just after sunset.\n\nYou'll have the best chance of viewing the alignment if you can find a location free of light pollution and a view of the horizon free of obstructions like trees or tall buildings.\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nIs a planetary alignment unusual?\n\nIt's not especially remarkable for a few planets to line up in the sky, but when we see four or five brilliant planets at once, it's less common, according to NASA.\n\nThe planets orbit the sun continuously in the solar system, so at times, they slowly catch up to one another. Because they travel along the same path, or ecliptic, as they pass Earth, it appears they are aligned. The alignment formation, however, is short-lived because planets move at different speeds.\n\nProfiles of the planets\n\nWith eight planets in our solar system, which includes Earth, they all have some very interesting traits.

However, a solid handful of Northern U.S. states may also have a chance to steal a glimpse.\n\nHere's what to know about this week's chance to view the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights.\n\nWhat are the 'northern lights' aka aurora borealis?\n\nThe northern lights are a luminous glow seen around the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres, according to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute. Known for creating ribbons of colorful light in the night sky, the aurora borealis are polar lights, or aurora polaris, that appear in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe southern hemisphere has its own polar lights known as the southern lights, or aurora australis, which create their own dazzling display.\n\nPut simply, auroras are a result of the sun interacting with the Earth’s atmosphere. A collision between electrically charged particles from the sun and gases in Earth’s atmosphere produces a series of minuscule flashes that appear like moving lights in the sky. The charged particles are pulled toward the North and South poles due to Earth’s magnetic field.\n\nWhile that magnetic field usually protects the Earth from solar winds, the winds can occasionally get strong enough to bypass the field, allowing particles and gases in the magnetosphere to interact and generate the colorful displays, according to the Geophysical Institute and the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nWhen will the aurora borealis be viewable?\n\nPeople in Canada and some parts of the Northern U.S. may get chances to see the aurora display on the nights of Tuesday, April 15 and Wednesday, April 16.\n\nPredicting the timing to view is a less-than-perfect science, as experts rely on NASA satellites to measure the impacts of the solar wind and magnetic intensity. Check NOAA's 30-minute Aurora forecast to get regular updates on the best times for viewing.\n\nWho will be able to see the aurora borealis?\n\nIn the U.S., the celestial display will only be viewable in the northernmost region. According to NOAA's projection, this could include at least some visibility from:\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMontana\n\nMinnesota\n\nWashington\n\nMichigan\n\nWisconsin\n\nMaine\n\nOregon\n\nIdaho\n\nWyoming\n\nIowa\n\nNew York\n\nNebraska\n\nIllinois\n\nVermont\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPennsylvania\n\nAccuWeather estimated that, if the geomagnetic storm is strong enough, the lights could be visible even farther south than these states. Plus, according to the weather source, you may be able to use long-exposure photography to capture images of the lights even if you can't see them with the naked eye.\n\nWeather forecast for viewing the northern lights in Greencastle\n\nUnfortunately for some, Accuweather is predicting conditions that may get in the way of optimal viewing.\n\nAs of Tuesday, its meteorologists said the Northeast and eastern Great Lakes region is expected to get some wintry weather characterized by cloudy conditions, rain, cold temperatures and even snow, though cloud cover is expected to improve Wednesday night.\n\nAccuweather forecasts cloudy skies over much of Franklin County on Tuesday, but mostly clear on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Midwest and northern Plains region will probably have the best weather for viewing Tuesday night, said AccuWeather, though cloud cover is expected by Wednesday night. The Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains are also expected to contend with cloudy weather on Tuesday night, though conditions may clear in Washington and Oregon by Wednesday night.\n\nAs with most celestial phenomena, the best viewing is during the darkest hours of the night and early morning in less densely populated areas away from light pollution.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/02/27/7-planets-to-align-2025-feb-february-28-when-to-watch-how-to-see-it/80517420007/", "title": "Planetary alignment 2025: How to watch rare event in February", "text": "Feb. 27, 2025, 5:01 a.m. ET\n\nSeven planets are aligning in the night sky and will be visible Friday, February 28.\n\nThe alignment, also called a \"planet parade,\" happens when planets' orbits around the sun cause them to appear close together in the Earth's sky.\n\nA seven-planet alignment will take place Friday and stargazers won't want to miss the rare spectacle.\n\nWhile NASA says it's unlikely that all the planets will be visible to the naked eye, they could all appear in some form in parts of the U.S. The upcoming cosmic event also follows a series of planets, like Mars and Jupiter, visible in various geographic regions nationwide in January.\n\nHere's what we know about Friday's planetary alignment.\n\nParade of Planets 2025: A seven-planet alignment happens in late-February, but it could be tricky to see it\n\nWhat is a planetary alignment?\n\nThe planets in our solar system orbit the sun essentially along the same line across the sky in a plane called the ecliptic.\n\nFor that reason, planets in our Earthly sky always appear somewhere along a flat, disc-shaped plane, according to EarthSky, a website dedicated to cosmic news.\n\nThe ecliptic is also the reason that we on Earth sometimes observe planets appearing to approach closely to each other in the sky \"while they careen around the cosmic racetrack,\" according to NASA.\n\n\"We see the racetrack of the planets from the perspective of one of the racers ourselves,\" Preston Dyches, who hosts NASA's \"What's Up,\" a monthly video series that describes what's happening in the night sky, wrote for NASA. \"When viewed edge-on, this disc appears as a line.\"\n\nWhenever planets become visible, these events are often referred to as planetary alignments.\n\nIs a 'planet parade' rare? How often do 7 planets align?\n\nWhile alignments themselves aren't special, it is rare to have an opportunity to observe multiple planets simultaneously without the need for instruments like ground telescopes. Such an event is also commonly known as a \"planet parade,\" though NASA noted that the moniker is not a technical astronomical term.\n\nThe colloquial term refers to how the planets form a straight line and look like they're marching across the night sky.\n\nThe phenomenon took place last June and then most recently again in January, when four bright planets and two faint planets were visible all month in the night sky.\n\nWhen is the next 'planet parade'?\n\nFour planets have remained widely visible in the night sky through much of February:\n\nVenus\n\nMars\n\nJupiter\n\nSaturn\n\nUranus and Neptune are also still around, but they won't be appearing as brightly and will require a telescope to see, according to NASA.\n\nAccording to Star Walk, the next \"planet parade\"\n\nWhen is the 7 planet alignment? Mercury to join in late-February.\n\nMars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky. But because Venus and Mercury orbit closer to the sun than Earth, with smaller, faster orbits, it's more rare for them to make an appearance, according to NASA.\n\nVenus is visible for only a few months at a time when it reaches its greatest separation from the sun. Mercury, which takes 88 days to orbit the sun, is visible for only a few weeks, or even days, at a time.\n\nMercury is expected to join the other planets in being visible to the unaided eye by Friday, Feb. 28.\n\nHow to view planet alignment 2025\n\nPlanet parades must be observed during twilight between dawn and sunset so a glowing sky does not obscure the view. So, find a dark place free of light pollution with a view of the western horizon.\n\nMercury and Saturn will be low in the sky, basking in the post-sunset glow, which will make both planets too faint for most observers to spot.\n\nThe planet parade that began in January will come to an end by mid-to-late February, as Saturn sinks increasingly lower in the sky each night after sunset, according to NASA.\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Janet Loehrke contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/10/16/northern-lights-forecast-aurora-borealis/86724799007/", "title": "Northern lights may be viewable in 15 states on Oct. 16.

Because of the way the solar particles interact with Earth's magnetosphere, the powerful eruption should make the vibrant northern lights visible to a wider swath of the Northern Hemisphere than usual.\n\nHere's what to know about the northern lights and how to see them on Thanksgiving night in the United States.\n\nNOAA issues Thanksgiving week geomagnetic storm watch\n\nNOAA has been tracking a coronal mass ejection since Sunday that exploded from the sun on a trajectory that should reach Earth later this week.\n\nForecasters use a five-level scale to measure geometric storms, which are caused when coronal mass ejections release solar particles and electromagnetic radiation toward our planet. The solar storm is relatively small; NOAA measured it at a minor G1 intensity Thursday and a moderate G2 intensity on Friday.\n\nThe forecast storm won't quite have the oomph of the G4-level whopper that came along Oct. 10, but it should still unveil the auroras across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nWhere will the auroras be visible?\n\nThe auroras are best seen around the magnetic poles of the Northern and Southern hemispheres in Europe, Asia and North America. In the U.S., Alaska is well known to have the best viewing opportunities for the northern lights.\n\nBut Thursday's incoming solar storm should make the auroras visible farther from the poles. The geomagnetic activity has a Kp index of 5, meaning the northern lights will also be brighter, according to NOAA.\n\n\"If you are in the right place, these aurora can be quite pleasing to look at,\" the agency says.\n\nIn the U.S., the auroras may become visible in some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center's experimental Aurora view line. The visibility for viewing also will depend on local weather conditions and city lights.\n\nThe northern lights may also be visible low on the horizon in several cities, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks Geophysical Institute website, which tracks the phenomenon.\n\nThose include:\n\nBoise, Idaho\n\nCheyenne, Wyoming\n\nLincoln, Nebraska\n\nIndianapolis\n\nAnnapolis, Maryland\n\nWhen is the best time to see the northern lights?\n\nSolar storms send particles flowing from the sun that get caught up in Earth's magnetic field, causing colorful auroras to form as they interact with molecules of atmospheric gases. In the months ahead, the resulting glowing auroras may be quite a sight – if you look up at the right time.\n\nEven though conditions are prime for more impending aurora shows, experts have long struggled to accurately forecast exactly when and where the phenomenon will ever occur. Even the best predictions can accurately be made only a few days or even hours in advance.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if the weather is clear, the best aurora is usually visible within an hour or two of midnight, according to NOAA. And if it looks as if the northern lights will flare up near you, you should get away from cities and travel to dark locations free from light pollution so you can best see them.\n\nThe agency also maintains an aurora dashboard that should help skygazers track the phenomenon.\n\nWhat causes the northern lights\n\nThe auroras are a natural light display in Earth's sky that are famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nThe phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with molecules and gases like oxygen and nitrogen, causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks.\n\nAs auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and even pink dance about in the sky depends on the altitude where the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time.\n\nWhy northern lights activity is increasing\n\nNow that the sun is at the height of its 11-year cycle, the increase in solar activity has more frequently fueled \"space weather\" that produces the right conditions for northern lights to flourish.\n\nRegions of intense magnetic activity known as sunspots are proliferating on the solar surface and are capable of releasing intense bursts of radiation resulting in solar flares that can hurtle toward Earth at the speed of light, according to NOAA. Some of the flares can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections, or clouds of plasma and charged particles, that emerge from the sun's outermost atmosphere, the corona.\n\nThese ejections can collide with Earth’s magnetosphere, the barrier protecting humanity from the harshest effects of space weather, to produce geomagnetic storms that unleash spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible.\n\nWhat's more, because NASA expects the solar maximum to continue into 2025, aurora chasers should have plenty more opportunities to catch the northern lights.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

But thanks to powerful bursts of energy from the sun, the northern lights, also called the aurora borealis, were unleashed unusually further south widely across the United States.\n\nOn that night, lucky skygazers across Florida rushed to gather their phones and head outside to document the light show. After all, who knows when the auroras will reveal themselves so far south again?\n\nHere's everything to know about the northern lights, and just how rare it is for the auroras to be seen in Florida.\n\nMassive geomagnetic storm hits Earth, unveils auroras\n\nA powerful geomagnetic solar storm blasted Earth on Tuesday, Nov. 11, and was expected to continue into the following day, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe agency's Space Weather Prediction Center, which was tracking the activity, ranked levels as high as a G4-rated storm – a single level away from being the most powerful solar storm possible. On NOAA's scale, that means the powerful electromagnetic energy was severe enough in intensity to cause \"widespread voltage control problems\" to ground-based power systems, and even disrupt space operations.\n\nOf course, the solar activity also helped unleash northern lights in regions unaccustomed to seeing them.\n\nNorthern lights seen as far south as Florida\n\nFor most of the time, Florida is simply too far south for the auroras to become visible under any but the most extreme circumstances.\n\nBut for a few brief hours overnight Tuesday, Nov. 11, the recent geomagnetic storm made the auroras visible farther from the poles.\n\nA total of 21 states were forecasted to have views of the northern lights, but NOAA's forecast proved to significantly underestimate the activity. Skygazers reported seeing the auroras as far south as Texas, Florida and Colorado – states that were not predicted to be within the viewline.\n\nAs the auroras danced overhead high above the horizon, people across Brevard County began to post photos of the sky glowing reddish-purple. The sight was at first only detectable with a smartphone camera, but by 11:30 p.m., the northern sky glowed a red hue that could be seen with the naked eye – even with city light pollution.\n\nWhat are the northern lights?\n\nThe auroras are a natural light display in Earth's sky that are famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nThe phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with molecules and gases like oxygen and nitrogen, causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy.

Amid the solar activity, the sun even emitted an explosive burst of radiation that became the largest solar flare detected since 2017, according to the NOAA.\n\nOn the bright side, it also unleashed spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible.\n\nThat included Florida, where views of the northern lights were visible as far north as Tallahassee and as far south as the Florida Keys.\n\nReports of the auroras being visible also surfaced once again in October 2024 in northern Florida.\n\nNorthern lights appeared in '80s in Florida\n\nPrior to that event, though, the last documented case of auroras appearing in Florida was all the way back in March 1989, when the aurora borealis was reportedly visible from Jacksonville.\n\nA few years earlier, in 1981, there were reports of much less impressive northern lights visible as far as south Florida.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

When this happens, the moon is passing into Earth's shadow in a color-shifting process that lends it the nickname, \"blood moon.\"\n\nThe upcoming total lunar eclipse in March, which, unlike the total solar eclipse in April 2024, doesn't require special equipment to witness safely, is the first since November 2022.\n\nHere's what to know about a total lunar eclipse, including when and how to see the next one.\n\nWhat is a total lunar eclipse?\n\nA lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes into Earth's shadow while aligning with our planet and the sun.\n\nWhen the moon is imperfectly covered by Earth's shadow as our planet passes between our natural satellite and the sun, it produces a partial lunar eclipse – like the one that took place in September. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire moon moves into the innermost and darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra, completely blocking it from the sun, according to NASA.\n\nThe moon, which does not produce its own light, shines because its surface reflects the sun's rays. Though the Earth blocks any direct sunlight from reaching the moon during a total solar eclipse, the sun still casts the Earth's shadow on the lunar surface.\n\nWhat does a total lunar eclipse look like?\n\nBecause the sunlight is blocked, the moon will be dimmer than usual. But the effect will also paint its surface with a striking reddish-orange hue for a few hours, creating a breathtaking sight in the night sky as it moves through the constellations Leo and Virgo.\n\nBecause of the color-changing phenomenon, lunar eclipses are often called “blood moons.\"\n\nWhat is a blood moon?\n\nThe process that produces the red or orangish glow is the same that makes our sky blue and our sunsets red, according to NASA.\n\nAs sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is refracted toward the surface.\n\nBecause blue light has a shorter wavelength and scatters relatively easily, that's why our sky appears in that color most of the time. Reddish light, which travels more directly in the air, manifests to ground observers during sunrises and sunsets when the sun is near the horizon and its incoming light travels at a longer, low-angle path through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThat's similar to what's happening on the moon during a total lunar eclipse when sunlight is once again refracted towards the surface of the fully eclipsed Moon. Even though Earth blocks sunlight from directly reaching moon during a total lunar eclipse, our planet's atmosphere still bends sunlight to indirectly light up the lunar surface.\n\n\"It’s as if all the world’s sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the moon,\" NASA explains.\n\nWhen is the total lunar eclipse?\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible throughout the U.S. on the night of March 13 into 14.\n\nThe website Time and Date predicts the moon will complete all of the eclipse phases in 6 hours, 3 minutes.\n\nIf you live in the U.S., here's a schedule of the eclipse from start to beginning, according to NASA:\n\n11:57 p.m. EST: you can see the eclipse starting when the penumbral phase begins as the moon enter the outer part of the shadow and begins to subtly dim.\n\nEST: you can see the eclipse starting when the penumbral phase begins as the moon enter the outer part of the shadow and begins to subtly dim. 1:09 a.m. : A partial eclipse begins as the moon enters Earth's umbra and starts to darken.

Forecast, when to see", "text": "Sept. 18, 2025 Updated Sept. 19, 2025, 7:45 a.m. ET\n\nA conjunction is an astronomical event in which at least two planets – or, in this case, other celestial bodies – appear to our vantage from Earth to be close together in the sky.\n\nThe trio of celestial objects in conjunction should be visible Friday, Sept. 19, after sunset and before sunrise.\n\nBecause the conjunction trio are among the brightest objects in our solar system, witnessing the phenomenon should be incredibly easy from Earth – as long as pesky clouds don't spoil the view.\n\nThe moon and Venus will shine vividly alongside a bright star in the early morning in a striking celestial rendezvous that should be visible across the U.S.\n\nBut unless you're willing to wake up before the sunrise, you just might miss a special celestial phenomenon that requires no equipment – just the naked eye – to observe.\n\nThe cosmic meetup, known as a conjunction, is set to occur between the moon, Venus and the star Regulus, NASA said in a monthly skywatching guide. The upcoming close approach of the objects represents another opportunity for skygazers to see a conjunction soon after Venus and Jupiter prominently shared a section of the night sky for much of August.\n\nBecause the conjunction trio are among the brightest objects in our solar system, witnessing the phenomenon should be incredibly easy from Earth – as long as pesky clouds don't spoil the view.\n\nHere's what to know about the Venus-moon-Regulus conjunction, how to see the three bright objects in September and a look at the cloud forecast in the United States.\n\nWhat is a planetary conjunction?\n\nA conjunction is an astronomical event in which at least two planets – or, in this case, other celestial bodies – appear to our vantage from Earth to be close together in the sky.\n\nEven though the planets are in reality still tens of millions of miles apart, the events present a special opportunity for astronomers and casual stargazers to see multiple worlds in our solar system at one time.\n\nSo, what causes conjunctions to take place?\n\nAs planets in our solar system orbit the sun at varying speeds, sometimes their orbital paths bring them close together on the same side of the sun. The same can be said of the moon, which instead orbits Earth.\n\nWhen this event lines up with our view from Earth, we get a conjunction, according to the nonprofit Planetary Society.\n\nWhen is Venus, moon, Regulus conjunction?\n\nThe trio of celestial objects in conjunction should be visible Friday, Sept. 19, after sunset and before sunrise.\n\nThe upcoming conjunction will be a party between the moon – Earth's only natural satellite – as well as a star named Regulus in the constellation Leo and Venus. The second planet from the sun, Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin since both bodies are rocky and share a similar orbit.\n\nWhere, how can I see celestial conjunction in September? Tips\n\nFor those in the Northern Hemisphere, which includes the U.S., spotting the conjunction is as easy as locating the moon.\n\nLook east in the early pre-dawn hours toward the waning crescent moon as it sets in the sky. The moon will be located near Venus and Regulus, Chelsea Gohd, a science communicator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, explained in a video.\n\nSeek out locations with unobstructed views of the horizons and check the weather forecast to ensure skies will be clear. DarkSky International is a U.S nonprofit that maintains a list of designated dark sky communities around the world, including 163 in the United States.\n\nWeather, cloud forecast for US\n\nOf course, clouds in the sky could also hamper the view.\n\nThe National Weather Service shared a graphic showing during cloud cover on the morning of Friday, Sept. 19 during when the celestial conjunction would be best seen. The numbers represent the percentage of cloud cover. The gray areas are the cloudiest.\n\nDo you need a telescope to see Venus, moon, Regulus conjunction?\n\nWhile telescopes certainly will enhance the view, spectators don't necessarily need any equipment to spot Venus, the moon and Regulus in the pre-dawn sky from the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThat's because after the sun, Venus and the moon are the two brightest objects in our night sky. Furthermore, Regulus is regarded as one of the brightest stars visible to Earth.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

What's more, the best stargazing opportunities are still ahead, as all of the meteor showers that became active in July have yet to hit their peak activity.\n\nIt begins in late-July when two relatively minor meteor showers hit a two-night peak. The cosmic light show will then hit a crescendo in August with the peak of what is widely considered the best meteor shower of the year: the Perseids.\n\nWith its whizzing meteors and blazing fireballs, the Perseid meteor shower reliably puts on a spectacle every year for stargazers around the world. Spectators who step outside at just the right time could be treated to up to 100 Perseid meteors per hour streaking across the night sky, leaving long wakes of light and color behind them.\n\nBut the best part of the Perseids? Because they peak in summer, spectators don't have to contend with cold weather like they do when other famous meteor showers such as the Leonids and Geminids hit their peak activity.\n\nHere's everything to know about the summer's upcoming meteor showers, headlined by the spectacular Perseids.\n\nWhen is the next meteor shower? 2 to peak at same time\n\nBoth the Southern delta Aquarids and the alpha Capricornids are due to peak at the same time between July 29 and July 30, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nThe Capricornids began their activity July 12 and were followed by the Southern delta Aquarids (also spelled \"Aquariids\") July 18. Both meteor showers will remain active until Aug. 12.\n\nUnfortunately, neither shower is famed for being very strong.\n\nThe Southern Delta Aquarids are faint meteors that are difficult enough to spot as it is. But if the moon is visible at all, it will be near impossible, according to NASA.\n\nWill it be cloudy in Florida for the July meteor showers?\n\nConditions look to be relatively clear for both nights when the Southern Delta Aquarids and Capricornids will be at their peak in activity.\n\nThe National Weather Service shared graphics showing the cloud forecast for both dates overnight in Florida.\n\nWhen was the last meteor shower? ETA Aquarids ended in May\n\nThe string of summer meteor showers are the first in nearly two months since the ETA Aquarids came to an end May 28.\n\nThe Aquarids, which first became active April 19, peaked between May 5 and May 6 as Earth passed through the densest part of the cosmic debris from the famous Halley's comet.\n\nPerseid meteor shower 2025: Here's when activity peaks\n\nThis year, the Perseids are expected to peak Aug. 12-13.\n\nThough the Geminids in December are considered to be one of the strongest and most consistent meteor showers, the Perseids still result in anywhere from 50 to 100 meteors visible per hour under the right conditions.\n\nWhat's more, the Perseid meteor shower gained its reputation for the plentiful whizzing meteors and blazing fireballs it reliably produces each year pretty much around the globe. These large explosions of light and color can persist even longer than an average meteor streak, NASA says.\n\nPerseid meteor shower underway: Where, when to look up\n\nBut you don't have to wait until the August peak to potentially see some Perseid meteors.\n\nIn 2025, the Perseid meteor shower became active Thursday, July 17, and will remain so until Aug. 23, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nThe Perseids are best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nOnce the sun sets and the moon is below the horizon, spectators should only have to contend with local light pollution and clouds that could interfere with the number of meteors they can see.\n\nLike all meteor showers, the Perseids are best viewed during the dark hours between midnight and dawn. However, it is possible under the right conditions to view Perseid meteors as early as 10 p.m. ET, according to NASA.\n\nCould the moon interfere with Perseids? Tips for seeing streaking meteors\n\nUnfortunately, the Perseid meteor shower is peaking three days after a full moon in 2025. For that reason, a bright waning gibbous moon could outshine the fainter of the streaking meteors and make them more difficult to spot.\n\nBut for those determined to catch a few of them, NASA has these viewing tips to increase your odds:\n\nFind an area distant from city light pollution or street lights.\n\nBring a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair. Lie flat on your back and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors.\n\nThe website TimeandDate also provides detailed information about where and when to see the phenomenon.\n\nWhat causes the Perseids? Are meteor showers 'shooting stars?'\n\nOriginating from the constellation Perseus, the Perseids are made up of leftover particles from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle.\n\nEvery year, Earth passes through the comet's debris trail, resulting in the Perseid meteor shower when the broken bits of Swift-Tuttle disintegrates in our atmosphere at high speed – creating fiery and colorful streaks in the sky known colloquially as \"shooting stars,\" according to NASA.\n\nSwift-Tuttle, which takes 133 Earth years just to orbit the sun a single time, was discovered to be the source of the Perseids in 1865 by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. Discovered in 1862, Swift-Tuttle is absolutely gargantuan – twice the size of the asteroid theorized to have wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Fiery finish\n\nJoey Logano led the majority of the final stage, and led going down the backstretch on the final lap before teammate Brad Keselowksi turned him into the wall.\n\nKeselowski made a move to pass Logano, but Logano blocked. The two slammed the wall, leading to a giant fireball erupting in Turn 3.\n\nMcDowell, who drives the No. 34 Ford, avoided the mayhem, and went three-wide with Chase Elliott and Austin Dillon coming out of Turn 4.\n\nAt the time the caution was flown, McDowell was declared the winner. This is his first Cup Series victory.\n\nBoth Logano and Keselowski emerged from their Fords OK, but the frustration was evident.\n\n\"I had a big run down the backstretch and wanted to make a pass to win the Daytona 500,\" Keselowski said. \"I wanted to win really bad. It's frustrating.\"\n\n2. McDowell's Daytona triumph\n\nMcDowell has been in the Cup Series for 14 years.\n\nWhile this is his first win, the 36-year-old has been particularly good at Daytona, recording two top-5s and six top-10s in 19 career starts.\n\nMcDowell drives for Front Row Motorsports.\n\n\"Daytona 500? Are you kidding me!?\" he screamed into the microphone after the race. \"We're the 500 champions. I can't believe it ... I just have to thank God. I've had so many years of grinding it out and waiting for an opportunity like this.\"\n\nElliott, the defending Cup champion, finished second, followed by Dillon, Kevin Harvick and Denny Hamlin.\n\n\"The top was so fast tonight,\" Elliott said. \"It made it to where nobody wanted to pull out until the last lap.\"\n\nHamlin, who is one of six drivers to win the Daytona 500 at least three times, was going for his third straight Daytona 500. He swept the opening two stages but lost the lead on a late green flag pit-stop and never got back up front.\n\nBubba Wallace, who drives for 23XI Racing — the team formed by Hamlin and NBA legend Michael Jordan — finished 17th.\n\n3. Big One strikes early\n\nThe annual Daytona Big One didn't wait around this year.\n\nChristopher Bell got into the back of Aric Almirola, who was running second, on Lap 14, sending Almirola's No, 10 Ford up the track and into pole-sitter Alex Bowman.\n\nThose two went hard into the backstretch wall and then came spinning back into the field, taking out multiple big-name drivers.\n\nMatt DiBenedetto was involved. So was William Byron, Martin Truex Jr., Ryan Blaney, Ryan Newman and Erik Jones.\n\nIn all, 18 cars were wrapped up in the mess.\n\n\"We were just getting pushed too hard too early,\" said Almirola, who dominated his qualifying race last week and appeared to have a fast Ford. \"It’s a long, long race. The 20 (Bell) just came with a big run and hit me really hard in a bad spot.\"\n\n4. Weather halts the 500\n\nIn typical Daytona fashion, Mother Nature led the early laps of Sunday's race.\n\nOne lap after The Big One, the skies opened up around the Speedway, soaking the high banks and sending the cars to pit-road.\n\nThey would remain there for the next five hours, withstanding strong storms and wind gusts until drivers were called back to their cars shortly before 9 p.m.\n\nThe race finally resumed just after 9:30 p.m. — five hours and 40 minutes after the initial delay.\n\nDrivers Chase Briscoe, of Stewart-Haas Racing, and Ross Chastain, in the No. 42 Chip Ganassi Chevy, left the track during the lengthy delay for a snack.\n\nSo did Tyler Reddick, who sat down inside Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen and ate some chicken pot pie.\n\nBriscoe went across the street in his firesuit to the Panda Express, while Chastain went to a local McDonalds.\n\n5. A tribute to Earnhardt\n\nBefore the weather and the wreck, the estimated crowd of 30,000-plus paid tribute to the late Dale Earnhardt, who died on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500.\n\nAs the field crossed the stripe for the third lap, fans in the grandstands and the infield held up the No. 3 for the entire lap.\n\nEarnhardt's No. 3 was also displayed on the infield jumbo-tron.\n\nREMEMBERING DALE EARNHARDT: An inside look at the Fox broadcast of the 2001 Daytona 500\n\nUnfortunately, the lap wasn't finished without drama.\n\nDerrike Cope and Wallace got tangled coming to Turn 3, resulting in Cope blowing a tire and hitting the wall.\n\nCope, the 62-year-old who won the 1990 Daytona 500, was making his final 500 start.

It marked the third career victory for the 35-year-old with all of them coming on superspeedways and two of them coming at Daytona.\n\nRace recap: A look back at the 2023 Daytona 500\n\n'Awful coverage today by Fox': NASCAR Twitter reacts to missing Daytona 500 crash\n\nA guide to NASCAR stage racing: Why does Daytona 500 have different stages?\n\nNeedless to say, Stenhouse feels right at home at the World Center of Racing.\n\n“Man, this is unbelievable,” Stenhouse said. “This was the site of my last win back in 2017. We've worked really hard. We had a couple shots last year to get a win and fell short. It was a tough season, but man, we got it done, Daytona 500.”\n\nThere was nothing conventional about how Stenhouse and his team got it done. Luckily, the how didn’t really matter.\n\n“I think this whole off-season, (crew chief) Mike (Kelley) just preached how much we all believed in each other,” Stenhouse added. “They left me a note in the car that said they believe in me and to go get the job done tonight. I made a few mistakes. We were able to battle back.”\n\nStenhouse grabbed the lead on the first lap of an initial overtime attempt with the field crashing behind him, necessitating another try. Logano, seeking his second Daytona 500 win, made a run to the front as the white flag waved but Stenhouse battled back with a push from Christopher Bell.\n\nThose three cars broke away down the backstretch as Kyle Larson, hooked by Travis Pastrana, slammed headfirst into the outside wall. The bump from Bell was just enough to get Stenhouse by and in the nick of time.\n\nLogano and Bell finished second and third, followed by Chris Buescher and Alex Bowman.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Stenhouse’s thrilling win at Daytona.\n\nJoey Logano replays the final lap in heartbreaking finish\n\nFor every breakthrough, there’s several heartbreaks and that was certainly the case for the reigning Cup Series champion.\n\nLogano came up just inches short in his quest for a second Harley J. Earl trophy to put with his two series titles despite leading at the white flag. Logano just couldn’t quite hold on as a crash behind the leaders fell at an inopportune time.\n\nAfterwards, he recounted the final moments.\n\n“Leading the white-flag lap there, I was up front. Kyle (Busch) gave me a good push and, yeah, you're watching in the mirror and you're three-wide across there,” Logano explained. “I felt like the three-wide was going a hurt a lane; looked like Kyle was getting pushed ahead, and then Ricky started getting pushed ahead.\n\n“I knew if I went to the bottom my car didn't handle good enough. I already got pushed off the bottom once and I thought, if I go down there I'm probably going to get wrecked, and I don't know if I can get down there in time to throw the block and so, I didn't want to wreck my car either. Then you don't expect them to wreck either. You think you're racing to the checkered flag and you put yourself in the best position to try to win at the start-finish line, and just caution came out — you wish you could race to the end. Obviously you can't when they wreck that much.”\n\nA long, detailed explanation then gave way to a simple sentiment.\n\n“Dammit,” Logano said. “I don’t know what else you can really say. It sucks finishing second in the Daytona 500.”\n\nChristopher Bell happy with third place, kind of\n\nBell was the third and final car in the lead breakaway and before the race, Bell said he would’ve taken third place and run with it. But after, being so close, even if it’s the last thing he expected, Bell admitted he was left wanting just a little more.\n\nTwo more positions, to be precise.\n\n“I hate superspeedway racing, it’s been my Achilles’ Heel for a number of years so just running third at the Daytona 500 is a big deal,” Bell said. “But being so close, I just feel bummed. I feel like we were in position here. But overall, I’m happy for Ricky. He’s won multiple speedway races and been close at the Daytona 500. I’m happy for him.”\n\nEarly crash takes out Chase Elliott, Tyler Reddick and Erik Jones\n\nA crash in the second stage took out a few contenders with Chase Elliott, Tyler Reddick and Erik Jones all bowing out long before the late fireworks erupted.\n\nReddick was leading the outside lane and attempted to gather momentum to challenge for the lead with 13 laps to go in Stage 2. But a push from Kevin Harvick turned Reddick into the outside wall and after bouncing off, he collected several cars, ending the day for Elliott and Jones.\n\nFor Elliott, who ended up 38th, it was another empty attempt at becoming part of the fifth father-and-son duo to win the Daytona 500, with Bill Elliott claiming two Harley J. Earl trophies. The Elliotts would join Dale Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt Jr., Ned and Dale Jarrett, Lee and Richard Petty, and Bobby and Davey Allison.\n\n“By the time we got slowed up, they were coming back across the track and I was the lucky winner to get there first,” Elliott said of the crash. “It’s a bummer …. long ways to go. Hate to end the day, but it is what it is.”\n\nAlex Bowman’s roller coaster ride\n\nFrom the pole and leading early laps to back in the pack to damage on pit road to a chance to win, Alex Bowman went through the gamut of emotions on Sunday as so many do.\n\n“We had a really fast Ally Camaro,” Bowman said. “Speedway racing ... and the race was interesting. We were kind of all locked side-by-side and nobody could really go anywhere.”\n\nStill, at the end of it all, Bowman came home fifth and made a little history in doing so, becoming the first pole sitter to finish in the top five of the Daytona 500 since 2001.\n\nFords fail to finish\n\nStenhouse’s late heroics spoiled what was shaping up to be a Ford freight train.\n\nSeveral blue ovals — Brad Keselowski, Chris Buescher, Aric Almirola and Logano among them — spent significant time up front, several times with multi-car, single-file lines leading the field.\n\nThat included down the stretch as Keselowski, who led with four laps to go and was trying to win the 500 in his 14th attempt, seemingly controlled the field. All told, the Ford camp led a combined 31 times for 122 laps but didn’t lead the right one.\n\nIt marked Chevrolet’s first Daytona 500 win since Austin Dillon won in 2018.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/02/20/daytona-500-2024-live-results-highlights/72668340007/", "title": "Daytona 500 results, highlights: William Byron wins 2024 NASCAR ...", "text": "Feb. 20, 2024, 7:50 a.m. ET\n\nIf 2023 was a breakthrough year for William Byron, 2024 could prove to be even bigger.\n\nByron, who led all NASCAR Cup Series drivers with six wins last season, scored the biggest triumph of his career Monday evening, winning the 66th annual Daytona 500 to kick off the 2024 season.\n\nByron took the white flag at Daytona International Speedway in his No. 24 Chevrolet seconds before a caution flag flew because of a last-lap crash. The 26-year-old edged his Hendrick Motorsports teammate Alex Bowman for the checkered flag, NASCAR officials ruled, after reviewing the sequence of events.\n\n\"Just extremely blessed and thankful for all the opportunities, now just want to keep it going,\" Byron said after exiting his car. \"We have a lot to prove this year, and this is a good start obviously. Daytona 500, it’s freaking awesome!\"\n\nThe one-two finish made a memorable day even more special for team owner Rick Hendrick and Hendrick Motorsports vice chairman, Jeff Gordon, who famously drove the No. 24 Hendrick Chevrolet to three Daytona 500 wins and four NASCAR Cup Series championships.\n\nMonday marked the 40th anniversary of Hendrick Motorsports' first race, and Byron’s win gave the team owner a record-tying nine Daytona 500 victories. Byron became the sixth different driver to win the Daytona 500 for Hendrick Motorsports and the first in nine years.\n\nMonday's win marked Byron's 11th Cup Series victory since 2018. The Charlotte, North Carolina native made it to the NASCAR championship race in 2023, finishing fourth in the race and third in the final standings behind champion Ryan Blaney and Kyle Larson, who won the 2021 title as a Hendrick driver.\n\nNow Byron will seek to join Larson and 2020 Cup Series champion Chase Elliott, and bring another season title to NASCAR's most successful owner 35 races from now.\n\nIt was a particularly rough ending for Team Penske and Ford, which had multiple Daytona 500 contenders taken out in two late crashes. The first one, with eight laps remaining, wiped out pole-sitter and 2015 winner Joey Logano and Blaney, among others, in a massive 18-car crash. The final crash took out 2022 Daytona 500 winner Austin Cindric, who was in position to win again on the penultimate lap before a wreck ended his and Penske's hopes for a victory lane celebration.\n\n\"It’s just a really unfortunate end. We had a shot to win the Daytona 500,\" Cindric said. \"We were really in great position with the outside lane breaking up and kind of one-on-one with the 24 with the whole pack behind, so you can’t really ask for anything else other than that out of myself and the team. It just sucks a little bit.”\n\nCindric finished 22nd, Blaney 30th and Logano 32nd. Noah Gragson, driving the Stewart-Haas Racing No. 10, had the best finish for For in nignth. Joe Gibbs Racing's Christopher Bell came home third to lead the Toyota drivers.\n\n“Honestly, we got really fortunate – with those two wrecks, you know,\" Bell said. \"Being on the bottom lane, I was able to squeeze by that last wreck. We had an awesome Interstate Batteries DEWALT Camry. ... When we had track position, we were fast.\"\n\nContinue below the photo gallery to read a recap and play-by-play of Monday's race.\n\n2024 Daytona 500 final results\n\nAfter reviewing the finishing order following the last-lap crash between Ross Chastain and Austin Cindric, NASCAR revealed the final results of the 2024 Daytona 500, which saw a handful of less-heralded drivers finish in the top 10:\n\nWilliam Byron, No. 24 Chevrolet Alex Bowman, No. 48 Chevrolet Christopher Bell, No. 20 Toyota Corey LaJoie, No. 7 Chevrolet Bubba Wallace, No. 23 Toyota AJ Allmendinger, No. 16 Chevrolet John Hunter Nemechek, No. 42 Toyota Erik Jones, No. 43 Toyota Noah Gragson, No. 10 Ford Chase Briscoe No. 14 Ford\n\nClick here for the full results from the 2024 Daytona 500.\n\nWilliam Byron wins 2024 Daytona as race ends under caution\n\nWilliam Byron won the 66th annual Daytona 500 Monday at Daytona International Speedway after NASCAR's premier race was delayed one day by rain.\n\nByron edged Hendrick Motorsports teammate Alex Bowman as a crash broke out just as Byron took the white flag for the final lap. Officials immediately threw a caution flag, and the checkered flag followed, giving Byron his first Daytona 500 win.\n\nAfter a massive crash shook up the race with eight laps remaining, the race restarted with just four laps left with Byron and Ross Chastain leading two large packs. Near the end of the penultimate lap, Chastain tried to squeeze in front of 2022 Daytona 500 winner Austin Cindric to retake the lead on the inside lane, but Chastain's No. 1 Chevrolet collided Cindric's No. 2 Ford, igniting a crash and bringing out the final caution as the final lap began.\n\nHuge crash erupts as 2024 Daytona nears end\n\nThe \"Big One\" broke out at Daytona International Speedway with eight laps remaining in the 2024 Daytona 500.\n\nAlex Bowman gave a hard shove to his Hendrick Motorsports teammate William Byron to push the middle pack forward, but Byron's No. 24 Chevrolet got loose, wiggled and then slammed into Brad Keselowski's No. 6 Ford, who was leading the inside lane. That contact near the front of the field triggered a massive crash that collected a 18 f cars including some of the favorites.\n\nAmong the cars taken out of the race in the crash: 2023 NASCAR Cup Series champion Ryan Blaney, three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin pole-sitter Joey Logano, the 2015 Daytona champ, and 2021 Cup Series champion Kyle Larson.\n\n\"It's speedway racing. It's a lot of fun until it sucks,\" Logano said after being checked and released from the infield care center along with Blaney, his Team Penske teammate.\n\nLast year's winner Ricky Stenhouse Jr. also got collected, along with Noah Gragson, Chase Briscoe, Chris Buescher, Martin Truex Jr., Daniel Hemric, Todd Gilliland, Ryan Preece, Erik Jones, Tyler Reddick, Ty Gibbs, Anthony Alfredo and Daniel Suarez\n\nOfficials threw the red flag on Lap 192, halting the race as the mangled cars were removed from the track.\n\nDaytona 500 nears end after final pit stops\n\nCars came down pit road for their final fuel stops with 20 laps remaining in Monday's race. Most of the drivers pitted with other cars from the same manufacturer.\n\nPit stops finished with 18 laps to go with Ross Chastain and Joey Logano upfront.\n\nJoey Logano surges to the lead in Daytona 500 final stage\n\nPole sitter Joey Logano assumed the lead on Lap 163 of 200 and has maintained it with final pit stops for fuel approaching. David Ragan, driving a one-off car for RFK Racing, and Brad Keselowski, co-owner of RFK, also moved to the front of the field, following Logano in the bottom lane. Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch paced the top lane with less than 30 laps remaining.\n\nDenny Hamlin, Kyle Busch battle for the lead midway through third stage\n\nFormer teammates Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch battled for the lead midway through the third and final segment of the 2024 Daytona 500. Busch was a longtime teammate of Hamlin with Joe Gibbs Racing before moving to Richard Childress Racing last season.\n\nHamlin has won three Daytona 500, the most among active drivers. Busch has won two NASCAR Cup Series championships but has never taken the checkered flag at \"The Great American Race.\"\n\nStage 3 goes green as Daytona 500 hits final segment\n\nAustin Cindric and Bubba Wallace led two competing packs as Stage 3 began in the Daytona 500 with less than 70 laps to go.\n\nThe cars then went three-wide a few laps later with AJ Allmendinger, Martin Truex Jr. and Tyler Reddick taking over the lead of the three packs.\n\nRyan Blaney wins Stage 2 of 2024 Daytona 500\n\nRyan Blaney won the second stage of the Daytona 500 after a power move on the closing lap. The reigning series champion dropped down to the bottom lane below his Penske teammate Austin Cindric and surged past him to take the lead and the checkered flag for Stage 2. Cindric, who won the 2022 Daytona 500, moved up in front of Kyle Busch on the outside lane to avoid falling back and held on to finish second, with Daniel Suarez taking third and Busch fourth.\n\nHere are the top-10 finishers of Stage (all will receive Stage points, with 10 points to the winner and one point to the 10th-place finisher:\n\nRyan Blaney, Ford Austin Cindric, Ford Daniel Suarez, Chevrolet Kyle Busch, Cheverolet Tyler Reddick, Toyota William Byron, Chevrolet Bubba Wallace, Toyota Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Chevrolet AJ Allemdinger, Chevrolet Chris Buescher, Ford\n\nStage 2 leaderboard shakes up with green flag pit stops\n\nKyle Busch takes the lead from Todd Gilliland on Lap 93 of 200, bringing Bubba Wallace with him.\n\nA few laps later, 20 cars came down pit road to take fuel to make it to the end of Stage 2. The group was led by Wallace, Ryan Preece, Joey Logao and Martin Truex Jr. Preece was nabbed for speeding entering pit road and had to serve a pass-thru penalty.\n\nBusch led the next group down pit road and one lap later Kyle Larson led another group as the entire field took fuel.\n\nStage 2 begins at 2024 Daytona 500\n\nKyle Larson and Josh Berry led the restart as Stage 2 began on Lap 70. Denny Hamlin, Alex Bowman, William Byron, Chase Elliott and Bubba Wallace also started near the front. But Joey Logano, the 2015 Daytona 500 champion who won the pole on Wednesday, led a surge on the outside, taking the pack three-wide to take over the lead on Lap 72.\n\nThe pole sitter has not won the Daytona 500 since Dale Jarrett triumphed in 2000.\n\nChase Elliott wins Stage 1 of 2024 Daytona 500\n\nChase Elliott, NASCAR's most popular driver, won the opening stage of the 2024 Daytona, edging his Hendrick Motorsports teammate Kyle Larson at the line. Elliott got a push from Ross Chastain in Turn 4 on the final lap to push him past Larson at the line.\n\nChevrolet drivers were the big winners of the 60-lap, opening segment and took the top six positions. After superior green-flag pit stops, Chevy drivers were grouped together in the closing stretch and held off a group of Toyota drivers. Here are the top 10 drivers in the first segment, who will all receive stage points:\n\nChase Elliott, Chevrolet Kyle Larson, Chevrolet Ross Chastain, Chevrolet Alex Bowman, Chevrolet William Byron, Chevrolet Kyle Busch, Chevrolet Denny Hamlin, Toyota Bubba Wallace, Toyota Martin Truex Jr., Toyota Daniel Suarez, Chevrolet\n\nCars come down pit road under green for gas to end Stage 1\n\nA large group of nine Chevrolets hit pit road for a splash of fuel with 10 laps to go in Stage 1, led by former NASCAR Cup Series champions Kyle Busch, Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson. One lap later, on Lap 56, Bubba Wallace led the Toyota drivers down pit road, including Denny Hamlin, Martin Truex Jr. and Tyler Reddick.\n\nCars hit pit road under green in Stage 1\n\nGreen flag pit-stops began on Lap 40 of the opening stage, led by three cars from Team Penske. Joey Logano, Ryan Blaney and Austin Cindric led a group of cars down pit road to fuel up with enough gas to finish the stage. Brad Keselowski, Christopher Bell and Daniel Hemric also pitted with the Penske cars.\n\nOne lap later, Chris Buescher came down pit road on his own, as did Michael McDowell on Lap 47 – never a good idea at superspeedways, when staying in the pack is optimal for speed.\n\nDaytona 500 resumes after early yellow flag\n\nThe Daytona 500 restarted on Lap 12 with Ryan Blaney and Christopher Bell pacing the field. Blaney, who had moved to the rear before the start because he was driving a backup car, elected to stay out on track when most of the field hit pit road during the early caution for fuel and/or fresh tires.\n\nThe caution flag flew because of a multi-car crash on Lap 6. Seven cars were involved, and Harrison Burton, Carson Hocevar, Kaz Grala, and Austin Dillon were forced to take their cars to the garage with excessive damage – ending their race early.\n\nMulti-car crash on Lap 6 of Daytona 500 brings out caution flag\n\nJust six laps into the 2024 Daytona 500, a multicar crash has already occurred. While racing three-wide in tight packs, Brad Keselowski, on the outside lane, got into the back of John Hunter Nemecheck, who swerved into the middle lane and into Harrison Burton, who then made hard contact with Carson Hocevar, sending both into the grass. As Burton and Hocevar came back onto the track, they collected Austin Dillon, Kaz Grala, Ryan Preece, and Jimmie Johnson.\n\nSix drivers racing in backup cars\n\nSix drivers had to drop to the rear of the field before the green flag waved because they were forced to go to backup cars after crashing in Thursday's Daytona Duel races. The drivers include reigning series champion Ryan Blaney in the No. 12 Ford and two-time Cup Series champion Kyle Busch in the No. 8 Chevrolet. Also dropping to the rear: William Byron (No. 24 Chevrolet), Noah Gragson (No. 10 Ford), Kaz Grala (No. 36 Ford) and Daniel Hemric (No. 31 Chevrolet).\n\nGreen flag flies at 2024 Daytona 500\n\nTwo former champions led the 40-driver field as the green flag waved at Daytona International Speedway for the \"The Great American Race.\" Joey Logano, the 2015 champion, was on the pole in the No. 22 Ford, and Michael McDowell, the 2021 winner, started alongside in the the No. 34 Ford.\n\nWho won last year’s Daytona 500?\n\nRicky Stenhouse Jr. edged two-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Joey Logano in double overtime to win the 2023 Daytona 500. It marked Stenhouse’s third career Cup victory and his first since he won the Daytona summer race in 2017. The victory was also the first Daytona 500 win for JTG Daugherty Racing, a small team that hadn’t been to victory lane in any Cup Series race since 2014.\n\nWhat is the Daytona 500 trophy?\n\nThe winner of the Daytona 500 will be presented with the Harley J. Earl Trophy, a four-foot-tall, five-foot-wide black and silver creation adorned with the winners of every Daytona 500.\n\nThe trophy is named after Harley J. Earl, an automobile designer, the father of the Corvette and the second commissioner of NASCAR.\n\nThey don't get to keep it, though. After the presentation, the big trophy, also known as the Harley J. Earl Perpetual Trophy, gets put back on display at Daytona International Speedway and the winner gets a smaller replica with a black base and a scaled-down version of the Firebird One that Earl created in 1954.\n\nThe winner's car also is put on display next to the trophy for fans to see over the next year. — C.A. Bridges, USA TODAY Network\n\nHow much money does the Daytona 500 winner get?\n\nThe total purse — all the money available to win — for the 2024 Daytona 500 is a record-breaking $28,035,991, up by more than $1 million from 2023, when the purse was $26,934,357. But as of 2016, NASCAR has not revealed how much of that the winner actually gets and how much goes to other drivers.\n\nIn 2015, it came out to about 9% of the total, so if that still holds, the winner of the 2024 Daytona 500 should get a payday of about $2.5 million. — C.A. Bridges, USA TODAY Network\n\nWho is the grand marshal for the 2024 Daytona 500?\n\nBefore the green flag flies, drivers must first be given a command to hit the track. That is the job of the grand marshal. For the 2024 Daytona 500, that job belongs to actor, producer, and former WWE star Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who will deliver the proverbial \"four most important words in motorsports”: “Drivers, start your engines.”\n\nCan the Daytona 500 be deemed official even if all laps haven’t been completed?\n\nA race can be called early if the rain will not stop, and the forecast continues to look bleak. But a race cannot be declared official until at least 100 laps have been completed or Stage 2 ends, whichever comes first (For today's race, Stage 2 ends at lap 130). If a race is called early, the driver in the lead at that point is declared the winner.\n\nWhat happens if it rains once the Daytona 500 has started?\n\nAfter Sunday's postponement, it's natural for weather to be on the minds of fans. So what happens if it rains once the race goes green?\n\nNASCAR officials will first throw a yellow caution flag and then bring the cars down pit road to their stalls. From there, officials will throw a red flag, halting the race, and teams will cover the cars after the drivers exit. But crews are not allowed to work on cars or fix any damage during a red flag.\n\nDuring a stoppage, you might see your favorite drivers or teams hit social media to converse with fans, do television interviews, grab some food, or just lay low.\n\nOnce the rain has slowed down or stopped, the fleet of Air Titans hit the track to dry it out. The Air Titans are big vacuum/sweeper trucks equipped with compressed air to blow water off the track and suck it up. Once the track is deemed safe enough to drive on, the race resumes.\n\nWho has the most Daytona 500 wins?\n\nRichard Petty truly was the king at Daytona. Petty won the Daytona 500 seven times (1964, 1966, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1979 and 1981), three more than the next closest driver, Cale Yarborough (1968, 1977, 1983 and 1984).\n\nDenny Hamlin has the most Daytona 500 wins among active drivers. The Joe Gibbs Racing driver, who will start eighth in the No. 11 Toyota, has won three times (2016, 2019 and 2020). Seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson (2006 and 2013) is the only other driver in the 2024 Daytona 500 field with more than one win; the co-owner of Legacy Motor Club is driving the No. 84 Toyota in the 2024 race.\n\nClick for a full list of Daytona 500 winners by year.\n\nStarting lineup for the 2024 Daytona 500\n\nIt will be an all-Ford front row with two former Daytona 500 winners pacing the field. Joey Logano, the 2015 winner, won the pole Wednesday night. The two-time Cup Series champion will start alongside 2021 Daytona 500 winner Michael McDowell.\n\nThursday night's Daytona Duel winners will start on Row 2. Tyler Reddick starts third to lead the Toyota contingent, followed by fellow Toyota driver Christopher Bell.

He reached out to me and I said if he could get it to come together give me a call. Fast-forward to the 500 and he says I think I have a plan: Chevy's gonna support it, RCR's gonna build the car and I have a Hendrick engine. I was like, 'This is getting serious now.'\n\nBiffle, who last won a NASCAR race in 2019 when he ran a one-off Truck race for Kyle Busch, said it's been a challenge getting everything buttoned up with the new Next Gen car.\n\nOf course, though, that won't stop him from dreaming big.\n\n\"Oh, I plan to win,\" he said.\n\n3:30 p.m. | Daytona practice results? Doesn't matter to Kevin Harvick\n\nKevin Harvick knows his way around Daytona International Speedway, winning the 2007 Daytona 500 and 2010 summer race.\n\nSo Next Gen car or not, the racing veteran said he didn't pay attention to Tuesday's lap times during practice and he won't ask about them during the rest of the week.\n\n\"I assume if we do things right, and the car is fast and does what I want it to do in the draft, we'll be there,\" he said.\n\nHarvick, by the way, was 12th fastest in the second practice Tuesday with a speed of 187.336 and 16th in the opening session.\n\n2:30 p.m. | Kyle Busch doesn't care about Daytona 500 qualifying\n\nKyle Busch being blunt on media day? Who saw that coming?!\n\nWhen asked about his approach for tonight's Daytona 500 front row qualifying, Busch didn't mince words.\n\n\"Zero,\" he said of the emphasis he puts on it. \"You'll find out. (We'll be) 18th if we're lucky. We try, but we're gonna be mid-pack. You'll see a Hendrick car or two on the front row. Same old stuff. A new car, but the same stuff. Watch out for the 48 car.\"\n\n1:45 p.m. | Defending champion Kyle Larson gives Tyler Reddick big endorsement\n\nKyle Larson took the NASCAR world by storm last season, winning 10 races and a Cup Series championship.\n\nSafe to say that was Larson's breakout season, right?\n\nSo, who does the defending champ think could be this year's \"Kyle Larson\"?\n\n\"Tyler Reddick ... I feel like he's gonna have a breakout season,\" Larson said of the 26-year-old RCR driver. \"When I watch him I think I'm watching myself. I think he's going to have an amazing season.\"\n\n1 p.m. | Brad Keselowski prepares for 1st season as a NASCAR owner\n\nBrad Keselowski made waves last season, announcing it would be his final with Team Penske as he planned to become an owner-driver for what is now Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing.\n\nKez will pilot Ryan Newman's old No. 6 machine, while Chris Buescher will remain with the team in the No. 17 Ford.\n\nBuescher, who is usually in the mix at Daytona, admitted Wednesday he'd have a hard time moving his new boss if it came down to it on Sunday.\n\n\"I'll take a shot, but I'm definitely not going to wreck my boss,\" he said with a laugh.\n\n10:45 a.m. | Chase Elliott on NASCAR: It's changed more in the last two years than the last 25\n\nNASCAR's most popular driver, Chase Elliott, grew up in the sport, going to the track with his dad (ever heard of him?) before becoming a full-time Cup driver himself back in 2016.\n\nSo if anyone knows what the old NASCAR used to look like, compared to today's version — including schedule changes, road courses, dirt tracks and the LA Coliseum — it's Elliott.\n\n\"It's changed more in the last 2-3 years than the last 25,\" Elliott said of the recent changes in the sport. \"I don't know where that line is. We have a sold out crowd on Sunday for the Daytona 500 and it seemed like everybody liked the Clash, so I guess they're doing it right. It certainly seems fine to me on my end.\"\n\n10 a.m. | Bubba Wallace on being a Black driver in NASCAR: \"It's always the media asking.\"\n\nBubba Wallace, the Cup Series' only Black driver, was asked during Wednesday's media day what it meant to be a Black driver in NASCAR, and how his experiences over the years have changed how he answers that question.\n\nWell, frankly, they haven't, Bubba said.\n\n\"It's always the media asking,\" Wallace said. \"Nobody else is walking around saying that. That's always been my take. When are we going to stop hearing about the Black driver? Whenever the hell ya'll stop saying it.\"\n\n9:45 a.m. | Is the Erik Jones, Ryan Blaney Clash feud over?\n\nErik Jones and Ryan Blaney's HANS device got nice and cozy at the LA Coliseum after Blaney tossed his neck restraint at Jones' No. 43 Chevy after the two wrecked during the Feb. 6 Busch Light Clash.\n\nAll good, Erik?\n\n\"He hasn't reached out to me, so I guess its resolved,\" Jones said with a laugh. \"If i had a problem with someone I'd talk to them, but I guess it's over.\"\n\n9 a.m. | What Michael Jordan told Kurt Busch before joining 23XI Racing\n\nIt's Year 2 of the 23XI Racing team — the Denny Hamlin/Michael Jordan-owned organization — and Bubba Wallace won't be the only driver in the meetings this season.\n\nKurt Busch, the 2004 Cup champion and 2017 Daytona 500 winner, will pilot the No. 45 Toyota this season, leaving Chip Ganassi Racing after three years.\n\nBusch said he met Michael Jordan last summer when his contract negotiation window opened, and one simple line from the NBA superstar made his decision to join the team easy.\n\n\"We will win together,\" Busch recalled.\n\n8:30 a.m. | Daytona 500 favorite Denny Hamlin reveals his secret\n\nWhen it comes to the Daytona 500, at least it in recent years, it starts and stops with Denny Hamlin.\n\nHamlin has won two of the past three 500s, and three of the past six. During the early portions of Wednesday's media day, Hamlin said his secret is simple ... it's the air!\n\n\"I have a good understanding here of the air and how it moves around the walls,\" he said. \"I guess it's something about the banking, the width of the track, height of the walls ... I just understand where those little pockets of air are better.\"\n\n8 a.m. | Michael McDowell looking to defend Daytona 500\n\nNo better person to start media day with than defending champion Michael McDowell.\n\n\"It's awesome!,\" he said of returning to the 500 as the defending champ. \"(This race) has more meaning than your average NASCAR race. IF there's one you're gonna win, this is the one.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2025/02/13/daytona-duels-live-updates-results-highlights/78536671007/", "title": "Daytona Duel highlights, results: Bubba Wallace, Austin Cindric win ...", "text": "Feb. 13, 2025 Updated Feb. 14, 2025, 12:23 a.m. ET\n\nNASCAR Cup Series drivers put on a show in two decidedly different races in Thursday night's Duel at Daytona, with Bubba Wallace and Austin Cindric taking the trophies when the night ended.\n\nThe Duel, which divides drivers among two 60-lap, 150-mile races, determined the full starting lineup for the 67th annual Daytona 500.\n\nBubba Wallace won Duel No. 1 in the No. 23 Toyota of 23XI Racing, topping defending Daytona 500 winner William Byron on the final lap. With the victory, Wallace secures the No. 3 starting spot in Sunday’s race.\n\n\"I was lucky to have (teammate) Tyler (Reddick) behind me – he did a great job pushing me,\" Wallace said after his win. \"I appreciate that massive 23XI effort to get us this win. But all-in-all, we’ve got McDonald’s back in victory lane at the Duel. It sets us up really good for Sunday.\n\n\"We will enjoy this little moment right now. I told myself I would do more of – enjoy the little stuff.\"\n\nThe first Duel was altered by caution flags, with the first one coming on Lap 3 and the second on Lap 14, completely changing the fuel strategy for the race. But none of it phased Wallace, who led a race-high 21 laps.\n\nDuel No. 2 was more mundane for most of the race, no doubt because drivers and teams had witnessed the opener. The first caution arrived at Lap 48 after the entire field had made green-flag pit stops. When the race restarted with just seven laps remaining, Cindric was back where he started – at the front of the field.\n\nCindric started on the pole in Duel No. 2 after finishing second in Wednesday night’s pole qualifying behind Chase Briscoe. Though he relinquished his Duel lead early to Denny Hamlin, he drove his No. 2 Team Penske Ford back to the front when it mattered.\n\nThe final lap of Duel No. 2 came down to a drag race to the finish line after Erik Jones, in the Legacy Motor Club No. 43 Toyota, made a strong move on the outside to challenge Cindric. And while it looked like Jones had edged Cindric by a hair, NASCAR officials had thrown a caution flag a second before the duo crossed the line. After video review, officials determined Cindric was leading when the caution flag flew, making him the winner.\n\n“Obviously a great race for us and a fast Discount Tire Ford Mustang,” Cindric said. “I thought it was super close. I thought I got it, but I think the 43 beat me to the line. But the caution light came out a little earlier, so obviously it was a great result and glad my guys let me race this one tonight to see what we had. Now we can tune on this thing for the 500.\"\n\nWith the Duel races completed, the lineup is now set for Sunday’s “Great American Race.” Briscoe and Cindric will make up the front row of the starting grid, followed by Wallace and Jones.\n\nFor highlights, results and a recap of all the action from Thursday night’s Duel races, see below:\n\nDaytona 500 projected starting lineup\n\nHere is the projected starting lineup for the 2025 Daytona 500, via NASCAR (*-denotes Open, non-Charter team).

Cindric, in the No. 2 Ford, and Jones, in the No. 43 Toyota, took the checkered flag at seemingly the same time, but because a caution flag was thrown less than a second before, NASCAR had to review which driver was leading when the yellow flag waved.\n\nCindric was already locked into the front row of Sunday's Daytona 500 after finishing second behind pole winner Chase Briscoe in Wednesday's pole qualifying. But his win in Duel No. 2 will generate extra regular-season points. With his second-place finish, Jones sewed up the No. 4 starting spot in the 67th annual Daytona 500.\n\nRFK Racing's Chris Buescher finished third in the No. 17 Ford, Denny Hamlin finished fourth in the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, and reigning NASCAR Cup Series champion Joey Logano took fifth in the No. 22 Team Penske Ford.\n\nDaytona Duel No. 2 results\n\n(Starting position in parentheses)\n\n(1) Austin Cindric, Ford (18) Erik Jones, Toyota (9) Chris Buescher, Ford (3) Denny Hamlin, Toyota (2) Joey Logano, Ford (17) Corey LaJoie, Ford (7) Todd Gilliland, Ford (10) Ryan Blaney, Ford (19) John Hunter Nemechek, Toyota (4) Christopher Bell, Toyota (5) Kyle Larson, Chevrolet (13) Riley Herbst, Toyota (20) Anthony Alfredo, Chevrolet (15) Shane Van Gisbergen, Chevrolet (22) Cody Ware, Ford (16) Cole Custer, Ford (21) BJ McLeod, Chevrolet (11) Noah Gragson, Ford (14) Jimmie Johnson, Toyota (8) Brad Keselowski, Ford (12) Daniel Suarez, Chevrolet (6) Alex Bowman, Chevrolet\n\nDaytona Duel No. 2 ends in a photo finish\n\nAustin Cindric, who started on the pole in Duel No. 2, and Erik Jones took the checkered flag at nearly the exact same time. But a caution flag was waved just before the cars crossed the line as a multicar crash broke out in the back of the field.\n\nCorey LaJoie, driving part-time in the No. 01 Ford, finished sixth as an open-car to lock himself into the Daytona 500 field.\n\nDaytona Duel No. 2 restarts after crash\n\nThe green flag drops with seven laps remaining. Chris Buescher and Austin Cindric restart on the front row.\n\nCaution flag flies after crash on Lap 48\n\nFollowing green-flag pit stops by all drivers, a multi-car crash broke out on the backstretch near the back of the field. The front of the field began slowing up, setting up an accordian effect further back. Daniel Suarez checked up, causing Alex Bowman to get into the back of his No. 99 Chevrolet. Suarez then spun into Brad Keselowski's No. 6 Ford. Bowman hit the SAFER barrier in his No. 88 Chevrolet and was unable to make it back to pit road, ending his race.\n\nFord cars make their pit stops\n\nFollowing fuel stops for the Chevrolets and Toyotas, the remaining cars – all Fords – came down pit road for fuel, shuffling the field.\n\nEntire inside lane pits for fuel on Lap 45\n\nAll of the Chevrolets and Toyotas came down pit road for fuel on Lap 45 of 60, led by Trackhouse Racing's Daniel Suarez. But Kyle Larson, Denny Hamlin and John Hunter Nemechek were penalized for speeding and will be forced to come down pit road again.\n\nJimmie Johnson makes an unscheduled pit stop\n\nTwo-time Daytona 500 winner Jimmie Johnson, who was running in the top four, radioed his team that he thought he was running out of fuel and came down pit road on his own – a major detriment in a pack-racing track like Daytona International Speedway. Johnson could never catch back up with the field and went a lap down on Lap 39. But the semi-retired seven-time NASCAR champion, who is driving a handful of races in 2025, is already locked into the field for Sunday's Daytona 500.\n\nJimmie Johnson rockets up the leaderboard\n\nSeven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson, driving the No. 84 Toyota for Legacy Motor Club, the team he co-owns, shot up near the front of the pack along with his teammate, Erik Jones, who is pacing the field in his No. 43 Toyota. Team Penske's Ryan Blaney has also moved into the Top 3.\n\nDenny Hamlin leads Daytona Duel No. 2\n\nThree-time Daytona 500 champion Denny Hamlin has led 12 of the first 13 laps of Duel No. 2 in his No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota. Also in the top six: Kyle Larson, Austin Cindric, Joey Logano, Alex Bowman and Chris Buescher\n\nDaytona Duel No. 2 begins\n\nThe green flag has dropped on the second of two Daytona 500 Duel races as Austin Cindric leads the field. Cindric will also start on the front row for Sunday's 67th annual Daytona 500, alongside pole winner Chase Briscoe.\n\nBubba Wallace wins Daytona Duel No. 1\n\nBubba Wallace's No. 23 Toyota outdueled William Byron's No. 24 Chevrolet and Ty Dillon's No. 10 Chevrolet to take the checkered flag in Duel No. 1 at Daytona. With the win, Wallace clinches the third starting spot in Sunday's Daytona 500. Wallace led six times for 20 laps.\n\nTrackhouse Racing's Ross Chastain finished fourth in the No. 1 Chevy, and Wallace's 23XI Racing teammate Tyler Reddick finished fifth in the No. 45 Toyota.\n\nJustin Allgaier raced his way into the Daytona 500 field as an open car after finishing ninth. Allgaier, the defending NASCAR Xfinity Series champion, is driving the No. 40 Chevrolet for JR Motorsports, the team co-owned by NASCAR Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt Jr. and his sister Kelley Earnhardt Miller that is making its Daytona 500 debut.\n\nDaytona Duel No. 1 results\n\n(Starting position in parentheses)\n\n(15) Bubba Wallace, Toyota (11) William Byron, Chevrolet (5) Ty Dillon, Chevrolet (19) Ross Chastain, Chevrolet (14) Tyler Reddick, Toyota (10) AJ Allmendinger, Chevrolet (4) Austin Dillon, Chevrolet (8) Chase Elliott, Chevrolet (17) Justin Allgaier, Chevrolet (7) Kyle Busch, Chevrolet (13) Ty Gibbs, Toyota (9) Michael McDowell, Chevrolet (2) Ryan Preece, Ford (3) Josh Berry, Ford (12) Martin Truex Jr., Toyota (21) Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Chevrolet (23) JJ Yeley, Chevrolet (18) Carson Hocevar, Chevrolet (1) Chase Briscoe, Toyota (22) Chandler Smith, Ford (16)Justin Haley, Chevrolet (20) Helio Castroneves, Chevrolet (6) Zane Smith, Ford\n\nDaytona Duel No. 1 leaders\n\n23XI teammates Bubba Wallace and Tyler Reddick are both racing in the top-four with 20 laps remaining in Duel No. 1. Also running up front: reigning Daytona 500 champion William Byron and Ryan Preece.\n\nPreece was later shuffled back after getting stuck on his own in the middle lane.\n\nPole winner Chase Briscoe retires from Duel No. 1\n\nNot wanting to risk his pole-winning No. 19 Toyota, Chase Briscoe and his Joe Gibbs Racing team opted to retire from Duel No. 1 to keep his car from sustaining any damage ahead of the 67th annual Daytona 500. Briscoe is still guaranteed to start on the pole for Sunday's race.\n\nHelio Castroneves knocked out of Daytona Duel No. 1\n\nJustin Haley got into the back of Chandler Smith, sending his No. 66 Ford hard into the wall on Lap 14 and collecting a number of other cars, including four-time Indy 500 champion Helio Castroneves, who was making his NASCAR debut. Smith and Castroneves were forced to retire from the race with damage, though the IndyCar legend is guaranteed a starting spot in Sunday's Daytona 500 with a provisional.\n\nHaley also hit the outside wall in the process, while Ty Gibbs, JJ Yeley, and Bubba Wallace also sustained damage.\n\nFirst caution flag flies in Daytona Duel No. 1\n\nZane Smith brought out the caution flag on the third lap after hitting the wall and cutting his right front tire in Turn 2. Smith, who was running in the fifth position, managed to make it back to pit road under his own power.\n\nDuel at Daytona No. 1 begins\n\nThe green flag has dropped on the first of two Daytona 500 Duel races as Chase Briscoe leads the field. Briscoe will also start on the pole for Sunday's 67th annual Daytona 500.\n\nHelio Castroneves attempts first NASCAR race\n\nHelio Castroneves, who won the Indy 500 four times in his illustrious open-wheel career, is behind the wheel of a Cup Series car for his first NASCAR race. Castroneves will start 20th of 23 cars in Duel at Daytona No. 1. Should his finishing result not lock him into the Daytona 500 field, Castroneves is guaranteed a provisional starting spot for Sunday's race but would start last on Sunday.\n\nWhat time do the Daytona Duel races start?\n\nDuel at Daytona No. 1 is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET.
