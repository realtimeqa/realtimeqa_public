Wilmore and Williams are now expected to board a SpaceX Dragon capsule with the Crew-9 team to undock early Tuesday morning from the International Space Station.\n\nThe four spacefarers – also including NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – would then make a water landing Tuesday evening near Florida.\n\nNASA was initially targeting a Wednesday undocking and return.\n\nWhat happened to the Boeing Starliner?\n\nThe impending homecoming has been months in the making for Wilmore and Williams, who in June flew to the orbital laboratory aboard the Starliner spacecraft. The mission, the maiden crewed voyage of Boeing's vehicle, ended in failure when a slew of technical issues with the spacecraft prompted NASA to send it back in September without its crew for an autonomous landing in New Mexico.\n\nWilmore and Williams, who instead joined SpaceX Crew-9 when Hague and Gorbunov arrived later that same month, have since been awaiting that mission to conclude and its replacements to arrive. That happened Saturday when the four astronauts of the Crew-10 mission reached the space station following a Friday night launch from Florida.\n\nThe Starliner astronauts will now make their long-awaited return journey to Earth with the Crew-9 team.\n\nNews about our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nWhen will the Starliner astronauts return with Crew-9?\n\nStarliner astronauts Wilmore and Williams are due to board the SpaceX Dragon that the Crew-9 team flew to the space station in late September to undock around 1:05 a.m. EDT Tuesday.\n\nAhead of Wilmore, Williams, Hague and Gorbunov would then be about a 17-hour flight back to Earth before they'd land at around 5:57 p.m. EDT off the Florida coast, according to NASA.\n\nHow to watch Crew-9 undocking, landing\n\nNASA plans to provide coverage of both the undocking and landing on its streaming service, NASA+.\n\nA livestream of the Dragon's undocking is scheduled to begin at 12:45 a.m. EDT Tuesday.\n\nThe space agency would then resume covering the Dragon's return voyage around 4:45 p.m. EDT Tuesday before the spacecraft's planned deorbiting burn and water landing.\n\nA press conference would then take place around 7:30 p.m. for NASA officials to discuss the landing, though the astronauts would not participate so soon after returning.\n\nWhat will Crew-10 do at the International Space Station?\n\nThe Saturday night arrival of the Crew-10 astronauts is what set the stage for Wilmore and Williams to finally return after more than nine months and 280 days in orbit.\n\nThe crew, under the command of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, also includes NASA pilot Nichole Ayers and two mission specialists from other space agencies: Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.\n\nThe Crew-10 mission launched Friday night from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelling the astronauts into orbit aboard their own Dragon capsule. Once separated from the rocket, the Dragon Endurance, which has flown on SpaceX crew missions before, used its own thrusters to autonomously power on to the space station.\n\nBefore the outgoing astronauts depart the station, they've been spending a few days helping the new arrivals familiarize themselves with the orbital laboratory and station operations during a handover period. Once the Crew-9 members have left, Ayers, McClain, Onishi and Peskov will become part of Expedition 73 and remain at the station for about six months on a rotation conducting scientific experiments.\n\nThe SpaceX crew missions are contracted under NASA's commercial crew program, which allows the U.S. space agency to pay SpaceX to launch and transport astronauts and cargo to orbit aboard the company's own vehicles. The Boeing Starliner is meant to one day become a second operational vehicle for NASA under the program, though its path toward certification remains fraught after its botched inaugural crewed flight test.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Crew-11's early return will represent the first medical evacuation in the 25-year history of the ISS, said Dr. James Polk, chief health and medical officer at NASA Headquarters.\n\n“Obviously, this was a serious medical condition. That is why we're pursuing this path,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a Thursday, Jan. 8, news conference.\n\n\"Crew member is stable. As we mentioned, we're not electing an emergency deorbit. But obviously, as we've already communicated, the capability to diagnose and treat this properly does not live on the International Space Station,\" Isaacman said.\n\nThe crew member's medical condition began on the afternoon of Wednesday, Jan. 7. Now, in the coming days, Isaacman said the SpaceX Dragon Endeavour spacecraft will depart the orbiting outpost with the four Crew-11 members: NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.\n\nPolk said NASA is erring on the side of caution by bringing Crew-11 home early. Isaacman said NASA expects to provide updates within the next 48 hours on the upcoming ISS undocking and atmospheric reentry-splashdown timeline.\n\nThe Crew-11 quartet launched into low-Earth orbit Aug. 1 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center aboard the Dragon and a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nFincke and Cardman had been scheduled to exit the ISS Thursday and perform power upgrade work during a 6½-hour spacewalk, including installing equipment and routing cables for a future solar array. Polk said the crew member's medical condition had nothing to do with spacewalk preparations, and it was \"totally unrelated to any operations on board.\"\n\n\"They obviously select four people that are in top-flight condition to fly these NASA missions. But of course, somebody can always come down with some sort of medical problem,\" Don Platt, director of the Florida Institute of Technology's Spaceport Education Center in Titusville, told FLORIDA TODAY, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"For them to make a decision like potentially cutting short an International Space Station mission — and all the ramifications that then entails — is showing sort of the severity of the possibilities that they're facing here,\" Platt said. \"Obviously, the capsule has to come back with that astronaut. And they can't leave other astronauts on the space station without a ride home.\"\n\nSlated to remain aboard the ISS are NASA astronaut Chris Williams and cosmonauts Sergey Mikaev and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. The trio launched to the orbiting outpost on Thanksgiving aboard a Soyuz MS-28 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.\n\n'Very rare' for crew to curtail mission for medical issue\n\nSpace author and podcaster Emily Carney said medical issues during stints aboard the ISS, which can range from six months to a year, are usually minor and resolved in low-Earth orbit.\n\n\"It’s very rare for a crew to curtail a mission due to a medical issue,\" Carney wrote to FLORIDA TODAY.\n\n\"The last time a crew had to leave a space station for medical reasons was in November 1985, a little over 40 years ago, when the crew of Soyuz T-14 had to return to Earth two months into a six-month mission aboard Salyut 7. The crew’s commander, Vladimir Vasyutin, had an infection that necessitated a return to Earth,\" Carney wrote.\n\nCarney said a significant medical event took place in 2019 on the ISS, where an unidentified crew member experienced a blood clot in the jugular vein. The condition was successfully managed with blood thinners, and the astronaut safely completed the scheduled mission.\n\nOn a minor note, Carney said astronauts can experience space adaptation sickness, which is a motion sickness suffered while people initially adapt to microgravity. This is unlikely to be the case now, as Crew-11 has been in orbit for more than five months.\n\nNASA may speed up Crew-12 launch from Cape Canaveral\n\nLooking ahead, NASA was targeting Feb. 15 to launch Crew-12 — the next four-person crew rotation to the ISS — for a long-duration mission.\n\nIn light of the medical issue, Isaacman said NASA is now evaluating earlier launch opportunities with its international and commercial partners.\n\nCrew-12 consists of NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.\n\nThe crew will launch to the ISS aboard a SpaceX Dragon and Falcon 9 from the Cape.\n\nNASA Crew-8 taken to hospital after 2024 splashdown\n\nThis is not the first recent health concern involving NASA astronauts.\n\nOn Oct. 25, 2024, the four members of NASA Crew-8 were flown to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola for evaluation \"out of an abundance of caution\" after their Dragon spacecraft splashed down off the Florida Panhandle.\n\nOne astronaut stayed in the hospital overnight for observation before rejoining the crew at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nCrew-8 had spent 232 days conducting scientific research aboard the ISS during their 235-day mission.\n\nIn August 2021, NASA postponed a spacewalk involving NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and JAXA Japan astronaut Akihiko Hoshide after Vande Hei experienced \"a minor medical issue.\" That spacewalk was scheduled to last six hours and 50 minutes.\n\nRick Neale is a Space Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY, where he has covered news since 2004.

This comes after being assigned to that cohort back in September. They will return in the SpaceX Dragon, which is named Freedom, alongside NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.\n\nHere's what to know before the upcoming return to Earth.\n\nHow did the astronauts get 'stuck' in space?\n\nWhen is the next Florida launch? Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA rocket launch schedule at Cape Canaveral\n\nWilliams and Wilmore certainly did not expect to be on the ISS for nine month when they launched to space in June aboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft on a crewed test flight. The test flight − which would have certified Starliner to ferry NASA crews to and from the ISS − was supposed to last only eight to ten days.\n\nThat short test flight became extended as NASA and Boeing rushed to find answers after the spacecraft's thrusters malfunctioned upon the docking with the ISS in June. Uncertain about safely returning Williams and Wilmore onboard the Starliner, NASA reassigned the astronauts to the upcoming Crew-9 mission.\n\nNASA removed two astronauts from its Crew-9 mission to allow for Williams and Wilmore to join the cohort, and return onboard the SpaceX Dragon − which carries four people at a time. The altered Crew-9 − only Hague and Gorbunov − launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon Freedom in late September.\n\nMeanwhile, the Starliner spacecraft had landed on September 7, without Williams and Wilmore onboard. According to recent NASA press briefings, Boeing is still working on resolving the issue with the thrusters.\n\nCrew-10 SpaceX Dragon issues\n\nCrew-10 was supposed to launch to the space station back in February, yet late last year, SpaceX encountered production issues with the Dragon spacecraft which would have ferried the crew.\n\nThe new Dragon spacecraft, that was supposed to carry Crew-10, was not quite ready due to a battery problem, so NASA opted to go ahead with another Dragon — known as Endurance — in order to launch sooner. This Dragon has flown three previous missions and had originally been slated to fly Axiom-4's private astronaut mission to the ISS.\n\nAstronauts speak out: This is not a 'rescue' mission\n\nEver since remarks on social media by Elon Musk and President Trump in late January, the story has confused many people.\n\n\"The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long,\" Musk wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Jan. 28. Musk owns the social media website, is the CEO of SpaceX, and serves as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump.\n\nSince the remarks, many astronauts have been sharing thoughts on social media. This past week, NASA astronaut, Karen Nyberg, took to Facebook to point out NASA's side of the story.\n\n\"The main thing to point out is that there is no 'rescue' mission to get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams home. NASA simply made changes to their operational timeline to accommodate them becoming part of the standard crew rotation − the decision to bring them home on a SpaceX vehicle was made LAST SUMMER. And nothing has changed since,\" wrote Nyberg.\n\n\"Though I know there had to be a huge mental adjustment for Butch and Suni as the plan changed from an 8-day mission to one of several months, making those adjustments is often part of the job,\" wrote Nyberg. \"As a former astronaut, the only astronauts I feel bad for are the two who had to be removed from Crew-9 to accommodate Butch and Suni's return and now have to wait for their chance to live and work on the ISS!\"\n\nNyberg also pointed out that NASA crewed missions to the space station typically last six months.\n\nThe expedition of Williams and Wilmore is not even close to the longest stay in space by U.S. astronaut. That record goes to Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in orbit in between 2022-23 when the Russian Soyuz spacecraft he flew on to the space station sprung a coolant leak − which extended his stay on the space station by six months.\n\nWhen will the astronauts depart the Space Station?\n\nOriginally slated for Wednesday, Crew-9 may return to Earth a day sooner than expected.\n\nCrew-9, which includes Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore, Williams, will suit up and prepare to undock the Crew Dragon Freedom from the space station tonight, Monday, March 17. NASA plans to begin live coverage of hatch closure starting 10:45 p.m. EDT Monday.\n\nOf course this all depends on weather off the West Coast of Florida, where the spacecraft is scheduled to splashdown.\n\nNASA states that Tuesday is looking favorable for weather. Crew-9 is slated to undock at 1:05 a.m. Live coverage will be provided on NASA's website beginning at 12:45 a.m.. If all goes well, and weather is still looking favorable, the Dragon will undock at 1:05 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nWhen will the astronauts splashdown?\n\nThe return trip will be around 17 hours, as deorbit burn is anticipated for 5:11 p.m. − which will slow the spacecraft down from its 17,500 mph orbital cruising speed for its reentry into the atmosphere.\n\nAfter a ride through the atmosphere, parachutes will slow the Dragon spacecraft down to 15 miles per hour. It will splashdown softly into the ocean, and NASA and SpaceX recovery crews will welcome the astronauts back to Earth onboard a SpaceX recovery ship.\n\nSplashdown is scheduled for 5:57 p.m..\n\nMedical teams will be ready to assist the crew, offering stretchers, yet this is not a concern. It is normal for astronauts to experience muscle weakness their first days back on Earth after being in microgravity for an extended period of time − and was even an issue during week-long Space Shuttle missions. Astronauts return to normal in the weeks post-spaceflight as their bodies readjust to Earth's gravity.\n\nNASA will address the public and media beginning at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday evening, providing mission updates.\n\nFLORIDA TODAY will also provide live coverage of the events beginning 3:45 p.m. on Tuesday, March 18 at FloridaToday.com/space.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

When, how ...", "text": "Updated Jan. 12, 2026, 11:18 a.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary Four astronauts are returning to Earth early from the International Space Station due to a medical issue with one of them.\n\nThis marks the first time a crew has evacuated the station for a medical emergency in its 25-year history.\n\nThe Crew-11 mission, a joint effort between NASA and SpaceX, will end ahead of schedule.\n\nFour astronauts aboard the International Space Station recently began packing their bags to prepare for an unprecedented early departure to Earth after one of them experienced a medical issue.\n\nThe impending medical evacuation would bring to an untimely end a joint NASA and SpaceX mission known as Crew-11, which reached the orbital laboratory in August. When the four spacefarers on the mission, including two Americans, land back on Earth, they'll become the first crew to ever depart the space station early for medical reasons in its 25-year history.\n\nNASA made the decision Thursday, Jan. 8, to end the mission early after one of the astronauts aboard the ISS experienced what the U.S. space agency referred to as \"medical concern.\" The issue also prompted NASA to cancel the first of two planned spacewalks for January.\n\nHere's everything to know about what happened on the International Space Station, and how to watch the four astronauts return home.\n\nSpaceflight in 2026: 6 spaceflights ahead in year ahead, from NASA moon missions to SpaceX Starship\n\nWhen will astronauts leave International Space Station early?\n\nThe astronauts of the Crew-11 mission are due to depart no earlier than 5 p.m. ET Wednesday, Jan. 14, from the International Space Station, NASA announced. Were the undocking to occur as scheduled, the crew would face a more-than 10-hour journey through space and Earth's atmosphere, culminating in a water landing around 3:40 a.m. ET Thursday, Jan. 15, off the coast of California.\n\n\"Mission managers continue monitoring conditions in the recovery area, as undocking of the SpaceX Dragon depends on spacecraft readiness, recovery team readiness, weather, sea states, and other factors,\" NASA said in a Jan. 9 blog post.\n\n1st-ever ISS evacuation due to medical emergency\n\nNASA's decision to cut short the mission came after a \"medical concern with a crew member.\" NASA did not identify the astronaut – who is stable – nor share details about the medical issue, citing privacy.\n\n\"The capability to diagnose and treat this properly does not live on the International Space Station,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a Jan. 8 press conference.\n\nThe medical issue forced NASA to postpone a spacewalk initially scheduled for Thursday, Jan. 8. A second spacewalk set for Thursday, Jan. 15 also appears to have been canceled.\n\nWhat is the International Space Station?\n\nThe International Space Station has been stationed in low-Earth orbit for more than 25 years, typically about 260 miles high, where it has been home to astronauts from all over the world. Throughout its lifespan, the station has served as a test bed for scientific research in microgravity and has in years past opened itself up to private commercial missions.\n\nThe orbital laboratory is operated through a global partnership of space agencies, including NASA, Roscosmos, the European Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nMore than 290 spacefarers from 26 countries have visited the International Space Station, including 170 from the United States alone, according to NASA.\n\nHow to watch NASA coverage\n\nNASA will provide live coverage of the return of the astronauts, beginning with them boarding and undocking on the SpaceX Dragon capsule they rode to the station until they splash down in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nCoverage will be available on the agency's streaming app, NASA+ – also available on YouTube and the agency’s X account – as well as Amazon Prime. Netflix, which provides some live NASA coverage, including rocket launches, is not promoting the event on its platform.\n\nWhat is NASA SpaceX Crew-11? When did it reach the space station?\n\nAs the name suggests, Crew-11 is NASA and SpaceX's 11th science expedition to the International Space Station.\n\nThe four astronauts selected for the mission reached the orbital laboratory in August, replacing the Crew-10 contingent.\n\nThe missions, most of which last about six months, are contracted under NASA's commercial crew program. The program allows the U.S. space agency to pay SpaceX to launch and transport astronauts and cargo to orbit aboard the company's Dragon vehicles, freeing up NASA to focus on its Artemis lunar program and other spaceflight missions, including future crewed voyages to Mars.\n\nNASA is also hoping to certify Boeing's Starliner capsule to add a second operational vehicle for missions to the ISS before the station is retired by 2030.\n\nWho are the astronauts on Crew-11?\n\nHere's a look at the four astronauts who are part of Crew-11:\n\nZena Cardman , a NASA astronaut from Virginia making her first spaceflight;\n\n, a NASA astronaut from Virginia making her first spaceflight; Mike Fincke , a NASA astronaut from Pennsylvania making his fourth trip to space;\n\n, a NASA astronaut from Pennsylvania making his fourth trip to space; Kimiya Yui , a Japanese astronaut of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA);\n\n, a Japanese astronaut of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); Oleg Platonov, a Russian Roscosmos cosmonaut.\n\nWhen will Crew-12 launch, reach space station?\n\nThe early return of the Crew-11 astronauts would leave the space station understaffed until the arrival of the mission's Crew-12 replacements.\n\nThe Crew-12 astronauts are due to arrive at the station as early as Feb. 15, NASA said as recently as Nov. 20 in a blog post. However NASA and SpaceX are now evaluating earlier launch opportunities.\n\nSpaceX uses its Falcon 9 rocket – one of the most active in the world – to launch the crew missions from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The astronauts themselves ride a Dragon crew capsule – the only U.S. spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to and from the space station – that separates from the rocket in orbit.\n\nWhat astronauts are on the International Space Station?\n\nThe Crew-11 astronauts are among seven people living and working aboard the International Space Station.\n\nNASA astronaut Chris Williams and Russians Sergey Mikaev and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who arrived at the end of November on a Soyuz MS-28 spacecraft, are the newest additions at the orbital laboratory.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Finally.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth on Tuesday after more than 280 days in space. Their water landing, which came after about a 17-hour voyage, is something of a storybook ending to the Starliner saga that has captivated the nation and recently become the subject of political posturing.\n\nMonths ago, Wilmore and Williams watched as the Starliner spacecraft they rode to orbit undocked from the International Space Station and left them behind. While the troubled test capsule manufactured by Boeing for NASA missions returned to Earth empty-handed, its crew had no choice but to remain for a few more months at the orbital laboratory.\n\nThe experienced NASA astronauts then had to bide their time in the cosmos until the stars aligned – figuratively, of course – for their own return journey to commence. That chance came early Tuesday morning, when Wilmore and Williams could finally board another spacecraft – this one manufactured by Boeing's competitor, SpaceX – to undock and leave the space station behind.\n\nThe astronauts landed just before 6 p.m. EDT on Tuesday off the coast of Florida in a SpaceX Dragon along with the two astronauts of a mission known as Crew-9.\n\n\"And splashdown. Crew-9 back on Earth,\" NASA communications officer Sandra Jones said while commenting on NASA's livestream.\n\nAll told, Wilmore and Williams' extended mission is now officially the sixth longest in NASA's history, with five astronauts having spent more consecutive days in space than the pair. Both will now get to at long last reunite with their families and friends while recovering from the toll of a lengthy spaceflight.\n\nRead more news about our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nWhen did the Starliner astronauts land with SpaceX Crew-9?\n\nJoining the Starliner astronauts for the water landing off the Florida coast at around 5:57 p.m. EDT were NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – the two Crew-9 astronauts who originally flew aboard the spacecraft to the space station in September.\n\n\"Nick, Alek, Butch, Suni on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home,\" the four were told by someone from Mission Control.\n\nThe splashdown came after Wilmore and Williams boarded the Dragon Freedom with the Crew-9 team to undock after 1 a.m. EDT Tuesday from the ISS Harmony module, a port and passageway onto the station. The departure was a little earlier than expected after NASA and SpaceX bumped up the return date from Wednesday to ensure weather conditions would be favorable for when the Dragon reached Earth.\n\nSpace X Engineering Manager Kate Tice said during NASA's official livestream that the Dragon successfully landed \"in the Gulf of America off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida.\"\n\nWhat happened with the Boeing Starliner?\n\nFor Hague and Gorbunov, the landing brings to an end an anticipated six-month routine science expedition to the space station. But for Wilmore and Williams, their nine-month stay was anything but expected.\n\nAs the two NASA astronauts selected for the first crewed flight test of Boeing's Starliner, Wilmore and Williams arrived in June at the space station for what was meant to be a brief orbital stay.\n\nInstead, that demonstration came to an ignominious end when NASA decided the troubled Boeing vehicle wasn't up to the task of transporting its crew back to Earth. The Starliner, which had encountered helium leaks and propulsion issues that engineers discovered when it reached the station, undocked in September without Wilmore and Williams for a parachute landing in the New Mexico desert.\n\nNASA ultimately decided to keep Williams and Wilmore in orbit for a few extra months rather than launch an emergency mission to return them to Earth in order to keep the space station fully staffed. In September, the SpaceX Crew-9 mission launched as planned, but with one crucial change: Just two astronauts, Hague and Gorbunov, headed to the station instead of four to leave two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nIn the months since, the original crew of the Starliner have been integrated into Expedition 72 at the station while awaiting the completion of the Crew-9 mission in order to return home.\n\nFor their part, the astronauts, who have both now completed three trips to orbit, have regularly spoke about relishing the extra time in the cosmos, including in an exclusive interview in January with USA TODAY. Wilmore and Williams also sought to dispel the notion that they were \"stuck\" at the station, insisting that the extended stay is simply part of the job.\n\n\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,\" Wilmore said earlier this month when he, Hague and Williams appeared from the station for a news conference.\n\nTrump, Musk weigh in on Starliner saga\n\nThe Starliner astronauts' insistence that they are not in distress at the space station hasn't stopped their unexpectedly long stay from becoming politicized.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office, he and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made assertions that the vehicle's crew were \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" in space and that the Biden administration was to blame. Trump also recently said that it was he who \"authorized\" Musk to retrieve the astronauts. The plan to bring the astronauts home was in place before he was elected.\n\nTrump doubled down on the claim Monday in a post on Truth Social, writing the Biden administration \"shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them – Another thing I inherited from that failed group of incompetents.\"\n\nWilmore was diplomatic about Trump and Musk earlier this month when prompted in questions from reporters, though he dismissed their claims that the decision last year to extend the mission was politically motivated.\n\n“The words they said, well, that’s politics. I mean, that’s part of life,” Wilmore said during the March 4 news conference. “From my standpoint, politics has not played into this at all.”\n\nCrew-10 arrival at ISS allows for Crew-9 to return on Dragon\n\nKey to the Starliner astronauts' ability to return to Earth was the arrival of another SpaceX mission replacing Crew-9 at the space station.\n\nThe Crew-10 mission, under the command of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, arrived Saturday night at the space station following a Friday night launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center. The crew of international astronauts selected for the mission also includes NASA pilot Nichole Ayers and two mission specialists from other space agencies: Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.\n\nThe mission got off the ground following a brief two-day delay do to an issue with the launchpad’s ground system, with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelling the astronauts into orbit aboard a Dragon capsule. Once separated from the rocket, the Dragon Endurance, which has flown on SpaceX crew missions before, used its own thrusters to autonomously power on to the space station.\n\nThe launch also came after NASA twice before delayed the Crew-10 mission, originally slated to get off the ground in February.\n\nNASA initially announced in December that the launch had been pushed to late-March to give SpaceX more time to prepare a new Dragon capsule for liftoff. The launch date was then moved back up to mid-March – possibly due to pressure from Trump and Musk – when NASA decided to instead use a \"previously flown\" Dragon.\n\nBefore the outgoing Crew-9 and Starliner astronauts departed the station, they spent a few days helping the new arrivals familiarize themselves with the orbital laboratory and station operations during a handover period. Ayers, McClain, Onishi and Peskov will soon be part of Expedition 73 and will remain at the station for about six months conducting scientific experiments.\n\nWhat's next for Boeing and Starliner?\n\nThe SpaceX Crew missions, most of which last about six months, are contracted under NASA's commercial crew program. The program allows the U.S. space agency to pay SpaceX to launch and transport astronauts and cargo to orbit aboard the company's own vehicles, freeing up NASA to focus on its Artemis lunar program and other deep space missions, including future crewed expeditions to Mars.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner is meant to one day become a second operational vehicle for NASA under the program, though its path toward certification remains fraught after its botched inaugural crewed flight test.\n\nBoeing officials had high hopes that a successful mission would be the demonstration needed to win approval from NASA for Starliner to make routine trips to orbit on behalf of the U.S. space agency. For that to still happen, the aerospace company has been conducting more tests and making modifications to the vehicle to remedy its propulsion system woes and prepare it for routine spaceflight, NASA officials have said.\n\n\"Once the test campaigns are complete, NASA will develop a potential Starliner flight schedule based on the International Space Station's current mission schedule,\" a NASA spokesman said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Those astronauts, Nick Hague of NASA and Russian Aleksandr Gorbunov of Roscosmos, are part of a mission known as Crew-9.\n\nNASA launched the Crew-9 mission in September with just two astronauts instead of four in order to free up two seats for Wilmore and Williams upon that mission's conclusion. The decision came after the U.S. space agency opted to send the troubled Starliner back to Earth without its crew, leaving Wilmore and Williams in need of a ride home − and extending their stay in space for several months longer than anticipated.\n\nWatch the livestream above as the astronauts of the Starliner mission finally make it back to Earth after more than nine months in orbit.\n\nWhat time did NASA livestream start?\n\nAs it did for the undocking, NASA began providing a livestream of the landing at about 4:45 p.m. EDT on its streaming service NASA+.\n\nSpace X Engineering Manager Kate Tice and NASA Communications Officer Sandra Jones are serving as commentators for the Tuesday livestream regularly providing updates.\n\nA press conference is also set to take place around 7:30 p.m. EDIT for NASA officials to discuss the landing, though the astronauts are not expected to participate so soon after returning.\n\nWhat time will the Starliner astronauts land with Crew-9?\n\nThe astronauts are approaching the end of about a 17-hour voyage back to Earth for a targeted water landing at 5:57 p.m. EDT off the Florida coast, according to NASA.\n\nThe imminent splashdown comes after the Dragon Freedom capsule undocked right on schedule at around 1:05 a.m. EDT Tuesday from the ISS Harmony module, a port and passageway onto the station.\n\nDragon Freedom began its de-orbit sequence at 3:04 p.m. EDT and completed a de-orbit burn about 16 minutes later, according to the livestream. That burn was going to \"help set them up on a trajectory to splash down,\" according to NASA's commentary.\n\nThe departure of the Starliner astronauts with Crew-9 is a little earlier than expected after NASA initially announced that the four spacefarers wouldn't head back to Earth any earlier than Wednesday. But after examining weather forecasted off the Florida coast, NASA and SpaceX opted to bump up the return date to when conditions should be better for the Dragon's landing.\n\nWhat is Crew-10 doing at the International Space Station?\n\nThe Saturday night arrival of the SpaceX Crew-10 astronauts is what paved the way for Wilmore and Williams to finally head home after more than 280 days in orbit.\n\nThe crew, under the command of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, includes NASA pilot Nichole Ayers and two mission specialists from other space agencies: Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.\n\nAfter a two-day delay, the Crew-10 mission launched Friday night from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelling the astronauts into orbit aboard a Dragon capsule.

The four spacefarers arriving on that mission, known as Crew-10, will pave the way for Williams and Wilmore to depart with the Crew-9 team.\n\nWhen the departing astronauts board a SpaceX Dragon docked at the outpost since September, it will represent the culmination of a return mission NASA laid out months ago – seemingly contrary to President Donald Trump's claim that he \"authorized\" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to retrieve the astronauts.\n\nBut even when the Crew-10 replacement mission reaches the space station as early as Thursday morning, the Starliner astronauts won't be able to come home right away. So when, exactly, could Williams and Wilmore return to Earth?\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nWhat happened with the Boeing Starliner?\n\nAs the two astronauts selected for the Starliner's first crewed flight test, Wilmore and Williams launched in June on a mission to test a Boeing vehicle intended to one day join the SpaceX Dragon in transporting NASA astronauts to orbit.\n\nThe mission was supposed to be a 10-day stay at the ISS. But that was before NASA discovered that the Starliner spacecraft had experienced multiple helium leaks and propulsion system issues.\n\nAfter months of deliberating, NASA officials decided that instead of having Wilmore and Williams return to Earth on Starliner, the agency would undock the empty vehicle for an autonomous landing in September in New Mexico.\n\nHow are the Starliner astronauts returning to Earth?\n\nUnder NASA's plan, first announced in August, it was decided that Wilmore and Williams would instead make their return journey aboard the Starliner's potential future competitor, a SpaceX Dragon.\n\nThe specific Dragon selected as Williams and Wilmore's ride back to Earth has since been at the station since late-September after arriving with the Crew-9 mission.\n\nThough that mission was the ninth science rotation mission to the station under NASA's commercial crew program, it was the first without a full contingent of four astronauts. Astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov were the only Crew-9 spacefarers sent to the orbital outpost on a Dragon with two empty seats reserved for the Starliner astronauts when their mission concludes.\n\nWhen could the SpaceX Crew-10 mission launch?\n\nBefore the Starliner crew members can depart with the Crew-9 team, they must await the arrival of the mission's successors.\n\nThe Dragon capsule transporting the four-member crew of Crew-10 is due to launch at 7:48 p.m. EST March 12 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA said in a mission blog update. The U.S. space agency plans to provide coverage of both the crew's launch from Florida and arrival at the space station the following morning.\n\nThe launch date for the Crew-10 mission, originally anticipated to get off the ground in February, has twice fluctuated since December.\n\nNASA initially announced that the launch had been pushed to late March to give SpaceX more time to prepare a new Dragon capsule for liftoff.

Joining Williams and Wilmore for the voyage are the two spacefarers of a mission known as Crew-9, who in September arrived at the orbital laboratory aboard that particular Dragon spacecraft.\n\nLater Tuesday evening, the Dragon carrying the four astronauts – including NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – is due to splash down off the Florida coast.\n\nThe imminent water landing would bring to an end a lengthy spaceflight saga that thrust Williams and Wilmore into the spotlight and raised questions about the future of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. For more than nine months, Williams and Wilmore have lived among the stars after arriving for a doomed mission that was only meant to last a few days.\n\nIn that time, the pair of experienced astronauts have become near-household names, with their ordeal capturing public fascination and later becoming politicized when President Donald Trump decided to weigh in.\n\nBut the stage was finally set for Wilmore and Williams to embark on their long-awaited return trip with the arrival Saturday of the Crew-10 astronauts, who have now replaced the outgoing Crew-9 mission aboard the space station.\n\nWhat time will Starliner, Crew-9 astronauts splash down?\n\nThe departure of the Starliner astronauts with Crew-9 is a little earlier than expected after NASA initially announced that the four spacefarers wouldn't head back to Earth any earlier than Wednesday.\n\nBut after examining weather forecasted off the Florida coast, NASA and SpaceX opted to bump up the return date to when conditions should be better for the Dragon's landing.\n\nThe Dragon Freedom capsule undocked right on schedule at around 1:05 a.m. EDT Tuesday from the ISS Harmony module, a port and passageway onto the station.

Instead of departing on the spacecraft that bore them to the space station, Wilmore and Williams had no choice but to watch as the the troubled Starliner undocked in September to head back to Earth without them.\n\nNASA ultimately decided to keep Williams and Wilmore at the station for a few extra months rather than launch an emergency mission to return them to Earth in order to keep the space station fully staffed. In September, the space agency launched the SpaceX Crew-9 mission with two astronauts instead of four to leave two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nFor their part, the astronauts have regularly spoke about relishing the extra time in the cosmos, including in an exclusive interview in January with USA TODAY. Wilmore and Williams have also sought to dispel the notion that they are \"stuck\" at the station, insisting that the extended stay is all part of the job.\n\n\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,\" Wilmore said earlier this month in a news conference with journalists from the station.\n\nTrump, Musk weigh in on Starliner saga\n\nThe Starliner astronauts' insistence that they are not in distress at the space station hasn't stopped their unexpectedly long stay from becoming politically charged.\n\nSince Trump took office, he and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have made assertions that the vehicle's crew were \"abandoned\" or \"stuck\" in space as a result of the Biden Administration. Trump also recently claimed that it was he who \"authorized\" Musk to retrieve the astronauts, despite the return plan being in place before he was elected.\n\nWilmore was diplomatic about Trump and Musk earlier this month when reporters asked multiple questions about their claims.\n\n“The words they said, well, that’s politics. I mean, that’s part of life,” Wilmore said during the news conference. “From my standpoint, politics has not played into this at all.”\n\nCrew-10 begins mission at International Space Station\n\nThe Saturday night arrival of the Crew-10 astronauts is what paved the way for Wilmore and Williams to finally head home after more than 280 days in orbit.\n\nThe crew, under the command of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, includes NASA pilot Nichole Ayers and two mission specialists from other space agencies: Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.\n\nAfter a two-day delay, the Crew-10 mission launched Friday night from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelling the astronauts into orbit aboard a Dragon capsule.

NASA and SpaceX, which jointly operate the Crew-10 mission, waived off the launch due to an issue with the launchpad’s ground system.\n\nHad the mission launched as scheduled, the Crew-10 astronauts would have rendezvoused with the space station early Thursday morning. The voyage was longer following the Friday night launch because the orbital laboratory was farther away when Dragon entered Earth's orbit, a NASA spokesman told USA TODAY.\n\nRewatch Crew-10 open hatch, greet astronauts\n\nThe hatch of the Dragon was opened after 1 a.m. Sunday, allowing the crew to exit the vehicle and enter the space station through its Harmony module. Once aboard, the four Crew-10 spacefarers officially greeted the Expedition 72 crew members, including the astronauts who flew aboard the Starliner.\n\nNASA provided a livestream of the moment on its streaming service, NASA+. One by one, the new arrivals floated through the hatch to greet the smiling crew aboard the station.\n\nIt was \"an amazing journey,\" McClain said during the live broadcast after that hatches were opened. \"You can hardly even put it into words.\"\n\nPeskov, during brief remarks, thanked \"all the world's space industry.\"\n\nWhen will Starliner astronauts return with Crew-9?\n\nThe arrival of Crew-10 means Williams and Wilmore will be able to return with Crew-9 as early as Wednesday, March 19, on a separate Dragon already docked at the station, according to NASA.\n\nThe Crew-9 mission, which reached the station in late September, included just two crew members instead of four – NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The decision to send a truncated crew allowed for two extra seats to be available on the Dragon capsule for the Starliner crew.\n\nThe tentative return date would allow for a few days for Crew-10 to orient themselves at the space station. The handover period is a crucial process for the outgoing astronauts to help the arriving spacefarers familiarize themselves with their new home and the work taking place, according to NASA.\n\nOnce Crew-9 undocks on the Dragon, they would make a splashdown landing off the Florida coast.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The payments by LUS to LUS Fiber raised concerns that the larger sister utility was illegally subsidizing Fiber to help pad the telecom's struggling bottom line.\n\nThe staff of Louisiana's Public Service Commission wrote in a June audit of Fiber following the payments that \"there is the appearance of self-dealing that clearly benefited the Fiber utility,\" calling the payments \"a form of subsidy\" to Fiber.\n\nLUS Fiber has struggled to reach profitability since its inception, and only saw its first year with greater revenue than expenses in 2016. State law prohibits a taxpayer funded utility from unfairly subsidizing a sister utility.\n\nRobideaux announced this summer that he discovered other payments LUS made to LUS Fiber, this time $8 million for a power outage monitoring service over eight years. But Robideaux said his staff couldn't find evidence the service was used or saved any money on outages. And he said it appeared to duplicate a $22 million system that also was designed to monitor power outages.\n\nIn 2011, when the payments for Fiber's power outage monitoring serve were established, Fiber ended the year in the red, spending $16.5 million more than the revenue it generated and maintaining an operating deficit of nearly $29 million.\n\nThe PSC's audit also revealed $5.4 million in annual payments from LUS and LCG to Fiber and highlighted several high-value LUS and LCG accounts that amounted to millions in annual payments to Fiber, including the $1 million a year power outage service.\n\nWhat money was involved?\n\nFiber paid back the $1.75 million in sewage lift station service payments to LUS once the issue was reported.\n\nPayments for the power outage service date back to November 2010, and were increased from an initial $20,145 a month to $84,450 a month in July 2011 by former LUS Director Terry Huval.\n\nThe PSC also identified other high-dollar payments to LUS Fiber by LUS and the city-parish government totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.\n\nFiber bills LUS $52,360 each month for internet services to some 77 smart meter gatekeepers, which act as neighborhood-level communication hubs for monitoring LUS's nearly 65,000 wireless smart meters, according to The Advertiser's analysis of Fiber billings to LUS.\n\nFiber also bills LUS's Electric Division some $60,000 a month for services to equipment at about 142 telephone poles and bills LCG $17,000 a month for traffic control equipment connectivity and $14,000 for internet connections to 59 Lafayette Police Department cameras on telephone poles around the city.\n\nRobideaux is focused on those payments to Fiber, which he announced in October when he also announced he was replacing the leadership at LUS and LUS Fiber.\n\nAre the payments proper?\n\nLocal and state officials determined LUS's payments for the unused sewer lift station services were improper. Because the services were only used at 38 of 101 lift stations where LUS had requested service, the PSC determined the payments violated state law prohibiting unfair subsidizing of a related organization.\n\nRobideaux also disclosed that he believes the $8 million in additional payments his staff discovered this year from LUS to LUS Fiber also could violate state law. He said his staff could not find evidence the service was used or saved LUS money; the payments were improperly calculated; and the payments were made for a service the city-parish already paid for through another system.\n\nRobideaux noted LUS spent $22 million to install smart meters for customers that were supposed to provide power outage monitoring. Huval since had claimed the smart meters did not provide real-time outage information because of software issues.\n\nRobideaux has said the LUS Fiber service only accessed its customers, which represents a small percentage of LUS customers. Huval said Fiber's outage monitoring service provided real-time outage information, making it significantly more useful than the frequently-delayed smart meters.\n\nRobideaux has also questioned the calculations used to determine how much LUS should pay Fiber for the monitoring service. He said LUS Fiber could only charge what it actually cost to provide the service to LUS, which \"would have been a fraction of\" the $1 million a year paid.\n\nHuval, who initiated the payments between LUS and LUS Fiber, initially priced the monitoring service at $20,145 in November 2010 based on an estimate of how much LUS would save by reducing power outages. Huval later increased the monthly payment to $84,450 — or about $1 million a year — based on “a recent study acquired through our friends in Chattanooga,” he wrote in a July 20, 2011 email to LUS’s legal counsel.\n\nHuval argued last week that LUS Fiber could have charged as much as $3.5 million a year, based on an accounting of its operating costs if factoring in expenses for the monitoring service.\n\nHuval argued that his savings-based estimate calculation saved LUS millions during its use of the system, but PSC rules require services like the outage service to be \"recorded under the full-cost accounting methodology\" when provided only to affiliated entities.\n\nWhat's changed at LUS in the last 2 years?\n\nFollowing the discovery of the unused services at LUS's sewage lift stations, Robideaux moved to separate LUS and Fiber operations. Huval announced he was retiring early, and his $250,000 annual salary was split between two managers that would run the separated utilities.\n\nAt about the same time, a plan considered by Robideaux to pursue third-party management options for LUS became public. Huval firmly opposed the option, even after his retirement. The plan was dropped.\n\nIn October, Robideaux removed the directors of LUS and LUS Fiber he earlier had appointed after Huval left, saying the change was needed “to facilitate an internal review (of the two entities) on behalf of the Public Service Commission,” according to the release announcing the leadership changes.\n\nRobideaux then appointed his Chief Administrative Officer Lowell Duhon to be the new interim LUS Director, though Duhon previously oversaw LUS as chief administrative officer. He also appointed LUS Fiber Business Department manager Kayla Miles to be the new interim Director of Fiber.\n\nBoth leadership changes were questioned by LUS’s consulting engineer, NewGen Strategies, and have since been criticized as politically motivated.\n\nNewGen’s Managing Director Tony Georgis wrote in a Nov. 5 email that neither Duhon or Miles was qualified to lead either entity in its daily operations and should delegate leadership decisions to “more qualified staff within LUS and LUS Fiber.”\n\nWhat happens if the payments are improper?\n\nShould the $8 million in questioned payments for Fiber's power outage monitoring service be determined to be improper, Fiber could have to repay the money, as it did with the $1.7 million in improper payments for the lift stations.\n\nIn 2017, Fiber saw $4.5 million in net income after posting $3.2 million in its first year of profitability the year before. But since 2008, the telecom has accumulated some $48 million in operating deficits that have been funded through loans from LUS and other borrowing.\n\nShould Fiber have to repay that $8 million along with a corresponding loss of $1 million in annual revenue it received for the service, the utility would likely see a further hit to its $48 million operating deficit at a time when its annual debt service payments for loans from LUS and bond sales stand to increase by $7.5 million annually.\n\nFollow Andrew Capps for breaking news and updates on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/20/solar-flare-nasa-space-sun/83741492007/", "title": "What is a solar flare? NASA reports two strong events in one week", "text": "May 20, 2025, 12:28 p.m. ET\n\nIn the span of two days last week, the sun released two strong solar flares — meaning the solar system experienced its most powerful explosions which can cause some communications blackouts on Earth, according to NASA.\n\nOn May 13 and 14, NASA reported two separate solar flares that were ranked in the X-class, which marks the most intense flares, according to the agency.\n\nThe flare on May 13 was classified as an X1.2 flare, while the following day's event was listed as an X2.7 flare — the number provides more information about the event's strength, according to NASA.\n\nThe events are significant because they can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts, according to NASA. Europe, Asia and the Middle East experienced radio blackouts during the May 14 event, according to Space.com.\n\nIn the coming days, however, there is a lower chance for solar flares, a spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told USA TODAY.\n\nThe sun is currently in the maximum phase of its 11-year solar cycle, meaning the sun's magnetic poles have flipped and it has transitioned to being in an active and stormy state, according to NASA.\n\nWhy are the latest solar flares significant?\n\nAccording to the NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, the May 14 solar flare was particularly significant because of the level of intensity.\n\n\"Flares of this magnitude are not frequent,\" NOAA wrote about the event.\n\nThe strong flares also coincide with the sun's solar maximum this year, which is a period when scientists generally expect more solar storms, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is a solar flare?\n\nA solar flare is a burst of radiation on the sun, according to NASA. They are the most powerful explosions in the solar system, with the biggest ones having as much energy as a billion hydrogen bombs.\n\nWhen strong solar flares occur, they can cause radio communication blackouts, according to NOAA.\n\nNOAA measures solar flares based on several factors, including the level of x-ray flares and radio blackouts possible. Solar flares measured around X1 — like the May 13 and 14 events — indicate strong flare intensity. An X10 flare is described as as a severe event, according to NOAA.\n\nThe most powerful flare ever measured was in 2003, which was recorded as an X28, according to NASA.\n\nHow do solar flares impact Earth?\n\nThe harmful radiation emitted on the sun during a solar flare doesn't reach Earth, according to NASA.\n\nHowever, solar flares can cause disruptions to high frequency radio waves.\n\nThese radio waves refract off a region of the Earth's upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere. When a strong solar flare occurs, the radio waves in the ionosphere may be degraded, causing a blackout in communication, according to NOAA.\n\nElectric power grids and navigation signals can also be affected, and spacecrafts and astronauts may face risks, according to NASA.\n\nWill there be more solar flares this week?\n\nDespite the two solar flares last week, the chances for another event in the coming days are low, Shawn Dahl, NOAA's SWPC Service Coordinator, told USA TODAY.\n\nFor the week of May 19, Dahl said there is about a 35% chance for a minor to moderate event, and even lower for a strong event.\n\n\"The risk for (high frequency) radio degradation through the rest of the week is low,\" Dahl said.\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Here's ...", "text": "Updated Oct. 5, 2020, 10:28 a.m. ET\n\nThousands of students and families are attempting to access remote learning without a stable internet connection at home.\n\nMost cities have areas that don't have easy internet access, and sometimes the available plans are too expensive.\n\nThough districts across the state are attempting to provide devices and mobile connections, the gaps still remain.\n\nFor the past few weekdays, Crystal Berroa woke up in the morning not knowing how to help her two young daughters attend school remotely.\n\nBerroa lives in a shelter in New York City and repeatedly tried to contact school officials to help her daughters log into remote learning classrooms on school-issued iPads.\n\nSo far, she hasn’t gotten anywhere.\n\n”If one (iPad) connects and the other doesn’t, I’m screwed,” Berroa said. “There’s nothing I can do. Sometimes it doesn’t connect at all during the day. My daughter is a first grader. She's learning how to read right now. And I have no idea what's going on.\"\n\nBerroa’s family is one of thousands across New York who have struggled with the transition to remote learning because of internet access or connectivity issues in metropolitan areas.\n\nThe problem is amplified this school year by the COVID-19 pandemic that forced New York's largest school districts to start the fall semester online, often in the state's poorest communities.\n\nFor the past five years, New York has focused on rural broadband, awarding grants to small internet providers to bring a stable connection to remote corners of New York.\n\nBut even the largest cities have dead zones, with no major internet providers available. In areas where service is available, it may be unreliable or too expensive for some families to afford.\n\nData on broadband availability, quality and cost isn't precise, and that's keeping New York from truly addressing its digital gaps, community advocates and lawmakers argued in a letter to Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday. They urged him to sign the Comprehensive Broadband Connectivity Act, which would compel the Public Service Commission to collect data on high-speed internet in the state.\n\nWith many school districts conducting partial or full remote learning this fall, especially in low income areas, a lack of stable internet at home could jeopardize the only connection teachers have to those students.\n\n“In some neighborhoods (in New York City) as many as 40% of schoolchildren could not afford the kind of high speed broadband they needed to participate in remote learning,” said Bob Master, political director for the powerful union, the Communication Workers of America Northeast, during a recent webinar on broadband access in New York.\n\nInternet in rural NY: Students and workers need high-speed internet amid COVID. But these barriers remain\n\nBy the numbers\n\nMultiple factors influence a family’s ability to secure a stable internet connection at home:\n\nPoverty plays a role: 38% of all New York households earning $25,000 or less have no high-speed home internet connection, according to an analysis of the 2018 Census data by Future Ready Schools, a network of nonprofits and research groups.\n\n38% of all New York households earning $25,000 or less have no high-speed home internet connection, according to an analysis of the 2018 Census data by Future Ready Schools, a network of nonprofits and research groups. Cities aren’t exempt: 20% of households in New York metro areas don’t have high-speed internet; nearly 750,000 students live in those households, the group said.\n\n20% of households in New York metro areas don’t have high-speed internet; nearly 750,000 students live in those households, the group said. A problem in upstate cities: Large swathes of residents in upstate cities have no home broadband access, according to National Digital Inclusion Alliance data. In Syracuse, 32% of households had no broadband connection of any type; in Rochester, it was 20%, and Buffalo was 19%.\n\nFamilies adjust to online learning\n\nFamilies without home internet access often turn to community spaces like libraries — but many of those were closed until recently and still have capacity and technology restrictions related to COVID-19.\n\nIn March, the Monroe County Library System, which operates over 30 locations in the greater Rochester area, lent 500 mobile WiFi hotspots to patrons and families who didn’t have home internet connections.\n\n“We knew these challenges were coming,” said Adam Traub, the library system’s associate director.\n\n“Libraries have frequently been points of access for the internet, and we take that role really seriously. Especially during COVID-19, we’ve really tried to step up our efforts.”\n\nIn Rochester’s downtown Central Library, it’s not uncommon to see grade school students set up in study areas with their Chromebooks and headphones, working on classwork with a parent or sibling supervising nearby.\n\nTrachelle Bivins and her 5-year-old son Ondrae Florence sat in the corner of a library’s large room study area, coloring sheets spread out in front of Ondrae’s Chromebook.\n\nThe two come to the library almost every day, usually at 10 a.m. when the doors open.\n\nBivins sits next to her son for about six hours, guiding him through his days in remote kindergarten at Rochester’ School No. 23. She brings a plastic bin full of activity sheets, juice, snacks, pencils and crayons, and anything else Ondrae might need.\n\nOndrae moved to a new school this fall, but hasn’t been able to meet any of his teachers or classmates in person — Rochester schools will conduct remote learning for the first ten weeks of the year.\n\nBivins was apprehensive at first.\n\n“I was wondering ‘How are they going to have gym? How are they going to do that?’” she said.\n\n“My first thought was, ‘I’m just going to teach him.’ But once we got to try (remote learning), it wasn’t as bad as I thought. It’s not like they’re sitting there all day….they give them times to get up and move and take breaks.”\n\nThough the family has an internet connection at home, Bivins’ two younger children are often home, making it a difficult environment for Ondrae’s learning.\n\nThe library offers a quiet, isolated space with a strong internet connection so he can focus, Bivins said.\n\nDown the hall from Bivins and Ondrae sat Boona and Gammachis Duresso, of Brighton. Boona, 9, a fourth grade Rochester student, watched a math lesson on his Chromebook screen while older brother Gammachis looked on.\n\nThe family recently moved to Brighton, a suburb east of Rochester, and had yet to install a broadband internet connection in their new home.\n\nThe Brighton library isn’t currently offering wireless connection to customers inside the building, so the brothers ended up at Central Library so Boona could attend his classes for the day.\n\nDuring the spring peak of the pandemic shutdown, when students were just figuring out remote learning, parents might park outside closed libraries to access the WiFi signal so their kids could do schoolwork, Traub said.\n\nNow, libraries are offering limited computers with extended evening hours in some locations. Some branches are working on partnerships with local schools to offer in-person classwork help to students.\n\nDespite the efforts, the public appears to remain wary of COVID-19 in gathering spaces.\n\n“Folks aren’t necessarily ready to come back,” Traub said. “It’s been a slow reopening.”\n\nRemote learning not effective for all\n\nIn New York City, perhaps the state's most polarized example of the digital divide, an estimated 500,000 households don’t have access to the internet, according to nonprofit advocacy organization Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York.\n\nAbout 100,000 school age students do not have internet services, and 80,000 report not having a device with which to access the internet, even if they have a connection.\n\n“In New York City, where most people have access in most cases to multiple providers, you have a very serious affordability crisis,” Master said.\n\nMost New Yorkers have one or perhaps two choices out of the major providers in the area, like Spectrum or Verizon Fios.\n\nBut those networks can be prone to outages and create an “oligopoly pricing” scenario, as Brian Hall, organizer at the wireless network NYC Mesh, calls it.\n\nSome pockets of the city have no access to any major internet providers.\n\nNYC Mesh launched in 2014 as a volunteer-run wireless network provider meant to bring high-speed, low-cost internet access to New York neighborhoods. Customers pay a $160 installation fee, followed by a suggested donation of $20 per month for service, if they can afford it, Hall said.\n\nThe group is currently wiring 600 apartments in Grand Street Guild, a three-tower affordable housing complex on the Lower East Side. Spending time connecting large apartment buildings is the fastest way to reach the largest number of lower income residents.\n\n“We’re focused on connecting people, and doing that in the cheapest, most efficient way possible,” Hall said.\n\nStudents in those target households are often also experiencing poverty and homelessness, leaving advocates concerned that COVID-19 and the shift to further remote learning will present yet another hurdle for them.\n\nThe state Big 5 districts — New York City, Yonkers, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo —all started the school year online, while wealthier districts mainly have had at least some in-person learning.\n\nNew York City changed its reopening plans just days before in-person learning was to begin on Sept. 21. Students started in-person classes last week.\n\nHomeless students are of particular concern for online learning, many of whom live in shelters with no internet access, advocates said.\n\n“Remote learning has not been going effectively and well for all students,” said Raysa Rodriguez, associate executive director at the Citizens' Committee for Children.\n\nUpstate districts bridging the gap\n\nThe Rochester City School District, in a city that has one of highest rates of child poverty in the nation, was already working on the local digital divide when COVID-19 hit.\n\nAccording to a survey by the group Roc the Future earlier this year, 20% of Rochester residents had no internet connection of any type, and 17% had only a cellular data connection.\n\nThat means 37% of Rochester homes did not have an internet environment that’s conducive to remote learning.\n\nThanks to the 1Million project, a national initiative to increase student internet access, the Rochester district secured 12,000 mobile WiFi hotspots for Rochester students in the past year, which allow them to connect devices to a mobile wireless network.\n\nAdditionally, the district lent Chromebook tablets to every student in grades 4 through 12 to facilitate online assignments and remote learning.\n\nThe Syracuse City School District also distributed 8,000 learning devices and 500 mobile hotspots, with hundreds more still waiting to be picked up.\n\nBut Rochester is still a long way from equitable internet access, said Glen VanDerwater, the district’s executive director of instructional technology.\n\nEven though most Rochester neighborhoods are covered by at least one of the major area internet service providers — Frontier Communications, Spectrum or Greenlight Networks — the high-speed broadband packages offered are either not available or not affordable for some families in lower income neighborhoods, VanDerwater said.\n\n“Internet is not reaching our families in the greatest of need,” he said.\n\nIn the spring, Spectrum offered 60 days of free Wi-Fi to families with K-12 students who didn’t already have a Spectrum internet subscription.\n\nThe company renewed that offer in mid-September, and last week introduced Stay Connected K-12, a broadband program that will allow school districts to help students secure an internet connection.\n\nBut that only gets families without internet access a brief reprieve.\n\nPeople who can’t access the internet for the school year can’t use things like online classrooms, online health charts or online banking. It also quells the voice of consumers who are unable to communicate over the internet.\n\n“As these utilities begin to develop without the input of our entire community, that utility is going to be built in a way that’s going to exclude their input,” VanDerwater said.\n\nSarah Taddeo is the consumer watchdog reporter for USA Today Network's New York State Team.

Wind gusts downed trees and power lines, the reports said. More than 75,000 people were without power across North Dakota and Minnesota the morning of June 21, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker.\n\nSevere weather to move east over the weekend\n\nThe same complex of storms that originated in North Dakota is expected to move eastward through the Great Lakes region during the day on June 21 and into New York and New England by night, the National Weather Service said. The storms could bring localized flash flooding, strong wind gusts and hail.\n\nThe storms come as much of the nation is undergoing a \"significant and extremely dangerous heat wave\" into next week, according to the weather service.\n\nA high-pressure system over the Southeast was creating a clockwise air flow, which brought moisture from the tropical East Pacific across the Plains, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center. It’s the peak of the summer dome of heat and high pressure that meteorologists sometimes refer to as a “ring of fire,\" Jackson said.\n\nAccuWeather reported that groups of thunderstorms are expected to form at the edges of the dome of hot air, causing the ring of fire effect.\n\nAs it moves east, the storm system could evolve into a derecho, a damaging wind event that spans hundreds of miles, AccuWeather reported. A derecho is also known as an \"inland hurricane.\"\n\nAn area of high-pressure area lingering over the Appalachian region, flanked by a trough of low pressure over the Great Basin, allows thunderstorms to develop around the edges in a ring shape. The clockwise airflow pulls in moisture from the Eastern Pacific, the same region that’s been cranking out tropical storms over the past week.\n\nHeat bakes eastern half of US\n\nMeanwhile, more than 150 million Americans were under some kind of advisory or warning for dangerous heat across much of the eastern half of the country.\n\nTemperatures on June 21 are expected to meet or exceed 90 degrees in parts of over two dozen states, according to the weather service.

When the mall first opened in 1970, each of its three anchor department stores included its own restaurant; the availability of “ample eating facilities” inside the mall in its early years was blamed in part for the closure of the first restaurant located in the mall’s parking lot, apparently just too far away to tempt hungry shoppers outside. By the ‘80s, clothing stores aimed at “juniors” or “younger women” were increasingly visible among the mall’s offerings that had previously been designated for women, men and children.\n\nBy 2020, the periodic closure of yet another Muncie Mall store because of the financial failure of a national or regional company felt like a recent trend that was gathering momentum. But in fact, the mall had seen just such losses within its first decade, as anchors and smaller stores disappeared from its halls, only to be replaced by others. The difference in 2020, however, is the question of what, if anything, might be the replacement this time.\n\n►MALL STORES STATUS: What's the outlook for companies behind some of Muncie Mall's remaining stores?\n\nThe '60s: The mall that almost never was\n\n1964: Indianapolis developer Melvin Simon and Associates begins waging \"a long hard battle\" over zoning to build a shopping mall on 56 acres at McGalliard Road and Granville Avenue, according to The Muncie Star. \"Original plans called for a four-story office and medical building, plus three high-rise apartment units,\" in addition to retail, a 1967 article notes.\n\nApril 1965: Muncie government officials and businessmen — including Edmund F. Petty, president of Ball Stores — visit the \"brand new air conditioned downtown shopping mall\" in Urbana, Ill., looking for ways to revitalize Muncie's downtown. Continued efforts by the \"Muncie Foresight\" group to boost downtown in subsequent years, even after construction begins on the northeast-side Muncie Mall, ultimately result in the closure of part of Walnut Street downtown for a pedestrian mall, but fail to halt the migration of numerous businesses over the years from the city's center to the mall and the eventual northside business corridor.\n\nJanuary 1967: The metro plan director says a northside shopping mall appears to be dead after rezoning for the land expires, but just two weeks later he reverses that, giving Simon the go-ahead to apply for a building permit.\n\nJuly 1967: Sears announces it will close its downtown store at 115 S. Walnut St. to move into the new mall.\n\nDecember 1967: A Muncie Star article about local development — which cites not only the long-awaited Muncie Mall but also plans for a South Walnut Street K-Mart and the nearly-completed Zayres at the Meadows Shopping Center west of downtown — is accompanied by a photo of a \"Coming Soon, Muncie Mall Shopping Center\" sign in an overgrown field at the corner of McGalliard and Granville.\n\nMay 23, 1969: A formal groundbreaking ceremony is held for the \"multimillion-dollar Muncie Mall... (a) 550,000-square-foot shopping complex at Granville and McGalliard,\" The Muncie Evening Press reports. When completed, the mall is slated to have 45 retailers and \"service firms\" with parking for 3,200 cars. Department stores are Sears, W.T. Grant Co. and Britt's Department Store. Other tenants lined up so far include Standard Supermarket, Osco Drugs, Steck's, Singers, Paul Harris Co., Jonathans, Zales, National Shirt, Kinney Shoes, Goodman Jewelry, Nobil Shoes, Hoyt Wright, Goodyear, Fabric Lane and Neumode Hosiery.\n\nThe '70s: Santa, Sears and so much more\n\nFebruary 1970: Mall construction progresses toward a possible grand opening in August, The Muncie Star reports, noting McGalliard and Granville will be altered by the mall developers later in the year to accommodate expected heavier traffic.\n\nAug. 5, 1970: Sears officially opens its new store, the first Muncie Mall merchant to do so. Muncie Star coverage warns of possible inconvenience for customers during the first few days of Sears' operation since entrance roads from McGalliard to the parking lot are still being completed. Ads for Sears later in the month don't hesitate to promise \"acres of free parking.\" An Evening Press item also published Aug. 5 offers directions for those wondering \"How do you get to the Muncie Mall.\"\n\nSeptember 1970: A Muncie Star article cites the new mall as the major reason that two-lane McGalliard Road has become \"a bottleneck\" between Wheeling Avenue and Broadway, especially during peak traffic hours. \"...With the prospect of the (four-lane) Tillotson-McGalliard extension opening and the increasing traffic to the Muncie Mall, McGalliard Road may prove to be Muncie's road-to-avoid-if-at-all-possible,\" the article states with startling foresight.\n\nOctober 1970: Zales Jewelers opens in Muncie Mall at the start of the month at the same corner it still occupies 50 years later, according to a map published in 1970.

(During construction, dynamite attached to one of the non-union construction company's trucks in the mall parking lot explodes on a Friday night, shattering windows in the King's building and knocking some mall doors askew.) The restaurant closes in February 1974.\n\nAugust 1971: In the wake of annexation that makes McGalliard Road the city's responsibility, Mayor Paul Cooley says widening McGalliard to four lanes between Wheeling and Ind. 67 to relieve the traffic bottleneck is a top priority, but finding the funds to do so will take at least two years.\n\nSeptember 1971: A first-anniversary celebration for the mall includes the giveaway of a 1971 Vega.\n\nOct. 29, 1971: Late-night TV \"spook show\" host Sammy Terry is featured at the mall's Halloween \"Spooktacular,\" along with a costume parade and contest for kids.\n\nNovember 1973: Mall merchants announce that Christmas decorations this year will be lighted only during peak customer traffic hours in order to save electricity during the nation's energy crisis.\n\nFebruary 1974: An ad from the Muncie Mall Merchants Association lists current businesses in the mall: The Animal Fair, Barker's Shoe Store, Bresler's 33 Flavors, Britts, Brooks, Check'rd Flag, The Children's Photographer, Dean's Magnavox and Frigidare Center, Grant City, Hickory Farms, Cinderella Shoppes, Holland House Cafeteria, Dr. Tavel, Father and Son Shoes, General Nutrition Center, Goodman Jewelers, Goodyear Service Stores, Hot Sam's Pretzel, Hoyt Wright, Junior Threads, Keros Coney Island, King's Food Host, Kinney Shoes, Lloyd's Shoes, Mangels, Merchants National Bank, Mode O'Day, Motherhood Maternity Shop, Musicland, National Shirt Shop, Neumode Hosiery Shop, Nobil's Shoes, Orange Julius, Osco Drug, The Party House, Paul Harris, Regal Shoe Shop, Regis Beauty Salon, Russell Stover Candies, Sears Roebuck and Co., The Singer Company, So-Fro Fabrics, Stecks, Stecks Tree House, W.K.

If states do not comply, they could lose out on billions of federal dollars used for public safety, emergency services and transportation infrastructure.\n\n“We are experiencing creeping authoritarianism in this country, and as a people we must continue to resist,” said Neronha. “By threatening to withhold these congressionally allocated funds, used for projects like fixing highways and preparing for natural disasters, the President is willing to put our collective safety at risk.”\n\nThe two lawsuits ask the court to prevent DHS and DOT from implementing the conditions. The attorneys general of California, Illinois and New Jersey join Neronha in leading the lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court in Rhode Island.\n\nAlso joining the coalition are the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii,, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.\n\nWhat are the new requirements to receive federal funding?\n\nIn recent weeks, state grant applicants and recipients have seen immigration-enforcement language added to their grant’s terms and conditions, even for those with no apparent relation to immigration.\n\nThe requirements include providing access to individuals’ citizenship or immigration status, participating in joint immigration operations, complying with demands to detain people, and ceasing operation of programs that also serve immigrants, according to a press release.\n\nIf the state does not comply, the federal funding related to transportation, counterterrorism and emergency preparedness could be taken away.\n\nTrump has made immigration a central part of his administration, with a goal of deporting 1 million people a year. Last month, Trump signed two executive orders that threatened to cut off federal funding to so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that limit or refuse to cooperate with federal immigration law enforcement\n\nWhat do the lawsuits say?\n\nBoth lawsuits argue that the Trump administration is violating the Constitution because the executive branch does not have the power to dictate federal spending. Congress has that responsibility.\n\nThey say that putting immigration-enforcement conditions on grants from both FEMA and DOT is beyond the agencies' authority.\n\nThe states called the threats a “hostage scheme.”\n\n“By hanging a halt in this critical funding over states like a sword of Damocles,” they argued in the FEMA suit, “defendants impose immense harm on states, forcing them to choose between readiness for disasters and emergencies, on the one hand, and their judgment about how best to investigate and prosecute crimes, on the other.”\n\nThe lawsuit also says that accepting the conditions would destroy trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, a relationship which is “critical to public safety.”\n\nHow does this affect Rhode Island?\n\nAccording to the attorney general’s office, Rhode Island could lose millions of dollars in funding for emergency preparedness and transportation projects.\n\nIn 2024, Rhode Island received more than $45 million in emergency preparedness and response funds.\n\nIn addition, $628 million in transportation funds, which go towards infrastructure projects like highway development, airport safety and the Washington Bridge project, could also be at risk.\n\n“More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States,” reads the DOT lawsuit.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/immigration/2025/02/03/migrant-advocacy-groups-file-lawsuit-over-trump-orders-to-stop-asylum/78190426007/", "title": "Migrant advocacy groups file lawsuit over Trump orders to stop asylum", "text": "Feb. 3, 2025, 4:53 p.m. ET\n\nEl Paso's Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and several other migrant advocacy groups filed a federal lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his administration over the \"president’s recent proclamation aimed at completely shutting down asylum at the border.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Monday, Feb. 3, in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in Washington D.C., seeking to halt any actions by the president to \"ignores protections put in place by Congress and backed by the courts for generations that ensure people have a chance to have their asylum claims heard,\" the complaint states.\n\n\"Once again, the Trump administration wants to eliminate the ability of families to seek safety in our country in the form of asylum, a legal pathway,\" Jennifer Babaie, director of advocacy and legal services of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said in a statement. \"Regardless of any person's individual beliefs on immigration, any government attempt to blatantly violate our laws is a serious issue impacting all communities across the country.\n\n\"Spreading falsehoods about an ‘invasion’ at our border only fuels fear, aiming to dismantle the entire asylum process and weaponize our immigration laws. At Las Americas, we take our role of welcoming seriously and are committed to protecting it. We will not stand idly by as our immigration laws are manipulated.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, National Immigrant Justice Center, Texas Civil Rights Project, Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, ACLU of the District of Columbia, and ACLU of Texas filed the federal lawsuit on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, and the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. All of the organizations provide various services to migrants seeking asylum.\n\n“This is an unprecedented power grab that will put countless lives in danger,” Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. “No president has the authority to unilaterally override the protections Congress has afforded those fleeing danger.”\n\nThe lawsuit states Trump is falsely citing an \"invasion\" as a justification to deny asylum protections expressly granted by the U.S. Congress to protect families and individuals returning to countries where they are at grave risk of persecution with no recourse.\n\nThe protection Trump has threatened to eliminate includes migrants' abilities to apply for asylum, and laws that prohibit migrants from being removed from the U.S. if their lives or freedom are under threat in their home country or cases where \"there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture,\" the lawsuit states.\n\n“This is the latest flagrantly illegal attempt by the executive branch to end humanitarian protection at the U.S.-Mexico border,” Richard Caldarone, senior litigation attorney at the National Immigrant Justice Center, said in a statement. “The immigration laws do not give the president autocratic power to override Congress and brazenly violate U.S. treaty obligations related to the protection of refugees.\n\n\"This latest attempt to do so will make thousands of people vulnerable to persecution, torture, and death, and we will not stop fighting until all those who require protection have the opportunity guaranteed by U.S. law to seek asylum in this country.”\n\nThe lawsuit seeks for a federal judge to \"declare that the proclamation is unlawful in its entirety\" and prevent the Trump administration \"from implementing or enforcing the proclamation and vacate any implementing guidance,\" the lawsuits.\n\nThe defendants listed in the lawsuit are:\n\nU.S. President Donald J.

The judge demanded a written explanation for the refusal by noon Tuesday and the American Civil Liberties Union warned that \"we’re getting very close to\" a \"constitutional crisis\" due to the Trump administration's actions. .\n\nThe administration says the Venezuelans are members of a gang called Tren de Aragua, and that they are being deported on national security concerns. Lawyers for the Venezuelans say they have not been given due process.\n\nSeparately, the administration deported Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese citizen and Rhode Island doctor, on Friday despite the fact that she holds a valid H1B visa as an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University.\n\nTrump administration getting ‘very close’ to constitutional crisis: ACLU\n\nGovernment lawyers argued Monday they complied with a judge’s order blocking deportation flights of Venezuelans but the judge remained skeptical of their reasoning.\n\nFederal Chief Judge for Washington, D.C. James Boasberg temporarily blocked the flights on Saturday – through an oral order and then a written one – under President Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. But lawyers for the Venezuelans said two flights took off after the oral order.\n\nA Justice Department lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, told Boasberg no flights took off after his written order. If the flights had crossed into international territory when Boasberg’s written order appeared, he no longer had jurisdiction, Kambli said.\n\n“We believe we complied with the order,” Kambli said.“That’s not a call that can be made in a split-second,” he added, referring to turning a plane around in mid-air.\n\nBoasberg said he maintained jurisdiction of deportees in U.S. custody beyond U.S. territory. He said if the government disagreed with his ruling, it could appeal, which it did. He remained skeptical that the government couldn’t turn planes around if his order coincided with the flights.\n\n“That’s a heck of a stretch, I think,” Boasberg said.\n\nGovernment lawyers were ordered to provide more information about the flights by noon Eastern Tuesday. But Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union representing the Venezuelans, suggested the government hadn't followed the judge's order.\n\n“There’s been a lot of talk during the last several weeks about a constitutional crisis, throwing that term around,” Gelernt said. “I think we’re getting very close to it.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nGovernment refuses to describe deportation flights\n\nGovernment lawyers refused Monday to provide a federal judge any information about flights that deported hundreds of Venezuelans under national security grounds, but the judge who temporarily blocked the flights demanded a written explanation for the refusal by noon Tuesday.\n\nChief U.S. Judge James Boasberg temporarily blocked deportation flights Saturday – first orally and then in writing – of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. But lawyers representing the deportees said two flights took off for Honduras and El Salvador between the oral and written arguments, suggesting the government defied the judge’s order.\n\nA Justice Department lawyer, Abhishek Kambli, told Boasberg no flights took off after his written order. He said Trump has sole control over military flights like any carrying deportees. He said he couldn’t share information in open court because of national security and delicate foreign negotiations.\n\n“Those are operational issues and I’m not at liberty to provide any information about the flights,” Kambli said. “It is based on national security concerns.”\n\nBoasberg disagreed. He said his oral order should count as much as a written one. He said he retained jurisdiction over deportees in U.S. custody even if they’ve left U.S. territory.

But flights were already in the air heading to Honduras and El Salvador when he ruled.\n\nGovernment lawyers led by Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a filing Monday the planes were already outside U.S. territory and so not subject to Boasberg’s ruling.\n\n“Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,” said government lawyers, citing a 1990 decision in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “A judge who proclaims ‘I enjoin you’ and does not follow up with an injunction has done nothing,” and, if the judge “does not record an injunction or declaratory judgment on a separate document, the defendant is under no judicial compulsion.”\n\nLawyers for the Venezuelans said the refusal to turn the planes around looked like blatant defiance of the judge's order.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJudge refuses to drop hearing over Venezuelan deportations\n\nA federal judge refused to drop his Monday hearing into whether the Trump administration defied his order temporarily blocking the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans, after government lawyers argued neither the judge nor the migrants had the power to stop the removals.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi and top aides urged Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg not to hold the hearing and “de-escalate the grave incursions on Executive Branch authority that have already arisen.”\n\nBut Boasberg rejected the request without elaborating.\n\nThe government lawyers argued that Boasberg lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute because the president has the ultimate power to conduct foreign affairs and negotiate with foreign governments to transfer deportees abroad.\n\n“Plaintiffs cannot use these proceedings to interfere with the President’s national-security and foreign-affairs authority, and the Court lacks jurisdiction to do so,” the government lawyers wrote. “Once the terrorists had been removed from the United States, any decision by the President to take such actions pursuant to independent constitutional authority is therefore not a violation of the Court’s orders in all events.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nU.S. disputes reports of a new travel ban\n\nThe U.S. State Department refuted a report on Monday that it had drafted a list of countries whose nationals President Donald Trump should consider for a travel ban.\n\n\"First of all there is no list.

Is it going to be all Venezuelans or all Mexicans, or is it members of a particular gang? How's this going to be used in an individual case? Who will be subject to it?

Boasberg held a 5 p.m. hearing where he expanded the order to cover all Venezuelans under the act that targets alleged members of the crime gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nTwo deportation flights left Harlingen, Texas: at 5:26 p.m. Eastern headed to Comayagua, Honduras, and at 5:45 p.m. Eastern headed to San Salvador, El Salvador, according to a filing by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward Foundation. The flights landed at 7:36 p.m. Eastern and 8:02 p.m. Eastern, respectively.\n\nBoasberg’s oral order to turn around planes headed to other countries came between 6:45 p.m. and 6:48 p.m. Eastern, according to the lawyers.\n\nBoasberg said during the hearing that “any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.”\n\nGovernment lawyers said in a filing Sunday the five initial plaintiffs weren't deported. The filing said Boasberg’s order was published in the online court docket at 7:26 p.m. Eastern and that “some gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation has already been removed from United States territory” before the second, oral order.\n\nThe lawyers asked Boasberg to review whether the government complied with his order.\n\n“If that is how the government proceeded, it was a blatant violation of the Court’s Order,” the lawyers wrote.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump justifies Alien Enemies Act because of ‘invasion’\n\nPresident Donald Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which has been linked to contract killings, kidnapping and organized crime.\n\nThe law says a president can invoke it during “a declared war” with a foreign nation or government, or when “any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted or threatened” against the United States. The law had previously been invoked only three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\n\nCongress hasn’t declared a war. But Trump told reporters while flying from Florida back to Washington on Sunday that he considered this a “a time of war” because foreign criminals entered the country without legal authorization during previous administrations.\n\n\"This is a time of war, because Biden allowed millions of people, many of them criminals, many of them at the highest level, they emptied jails out,” Trump said. “That's an invasion. They invaded our country.”\n\n“In that sense, this is war,” Trump added. “In many respects, it's more dangerous than war because, you know, in war, they have uniforms. You know who you're shooting at. You know you're going after.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWhy were hundreds of Venezuelans deported?\n\nChief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg initially ordered the administration Saturday not to deport five Venezuelans who were fighting their removal from the United States. He later expanded the order to cover all Venezuelans being deported under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nBut flight logs suggest at least two deportation flights bound for Honduras and El Salvador might have taken off or landed after Boasberg issued his second oral order.\n\nThe Trump administration has asked the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to halt Boasberg's order while the case is litigated. The appeals court asked for written arguments Tuesday from the government and Wednesday from Venezuelans.

The lawsuits also claim the arrests, made as Elias and Melson protested police activity, violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly.\n\nJoe Askar, solicitor for the borough, said he is reviewing the filings and declined to comment.\n\nAftermath of an ‘intense’ operation\n\nInterviewed over the summer, Ambridge Police Chief John DeLuca referred to the operation as a “saturation patrol,” involving multiple local and federal forces, and “not an ICE detention roundup.” He said the department would work with ICE when asked, though it doesn’t have a formal contractual agreement.\n\nICE agents, aided by Ambridge police, the Beaver County Sheriff’s office and at least one Pennsylvania State Police officer, arrested individuals across town over the course of several hours the night of July 31. Observers and response volunteers crowded outside the police station.\n\nElias witnessed 12 arrests targeting suspected immigrants and, according to the complaint, began marching the perimeter of the Ambridge police station holding a homemade sign that read “No Justice, No Peace” and chanting “Shame!”\n\nThe Ambridge operation followed protests across the country as immigrant communities and advocates denounced ICE’s increasingly forceful tactics under President Donald Trump. In the Pittsburgh area, immigration-related arrests soared in the first six months of his administration.\n\nObservers in Ambridge said the arrests disrupted the Beaver County river town that’s home to a growing Latino community. Some suspected racial profiling, pointing to a traffic stop of a young Latino couple earlier in the night.Jaime Martinez, community defense organizer at Casa San José, said at the time, “This is the most intense thing we have ever seen.” Martinez leads a network of volunteers trained to respond in real time to ICE sightings, arrests and raids in an effort to document federal agents and deter a reported increase in civil rights violations under the Trump administration.\n\nMelson and Elias told Public Source that their lawsuits help give voice to those arrested by ICE and draw attention to how a national issue is affecting the local community.\n\n“The people who were taken that night aren’t afforded the ability to hold police and elected officials accountable,” Melson said.\n\nForceful arrests alleged\n\nElias was arrested around 10:40 p.m. and later charged with disorderly conduct, unreasonable noise and resisting arrest. A magisterial judge dismissed the charges for both Elias and Melson after they completed 25 hours of community service.\n\nMelson and her wife joined observers outside the police department shortly before Elias’ arrest. The complaint states that, after arresting Elias, officers directed Melson and others to step back another 10 to 15 feet because officers were taking someone into custody.\n\nLess than a minute later, officers Michael Longo and John Chickos arrested her, according to the filing. She claims no other bystanders around her were arrested, despite also not stepping back after police orders.\n\nWhile in custody, the filing states, Chickos used repeated force by “throwing her around” and pinching her under her arms, leaving bruises. Another unidentified officer kicked her, according to the suit, and she was strip-searched at the Beaver County Jail.\n\nShe claims she repeatedly asked for legal counsel, but was not permitted to contact a lawyer. Later, according to the lawsuit, an attorney representing Melson called the police department and was told by an officer she could not speak with her client. He said Melson’s charges were “not just disorderly,” though he refused to tell her what the charges were, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMelson was ultimately charged with obstruction of administrative law, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment.\n\nElias’ lawsuit states Ambridge Sgt. Sokheng Seng pulled Elias’ arm outside the normal range of motion, causing an “involuntary jerking” during the arrest. Elias claims he suffered physical injury, pain and emotional distress, according to the lawsuit.\n\nProtecting the right to protest\n\nEspecially in a small town, Elias said, people should be able to trust that police will protect them.\n\n“It’s important that somebody helps to keep the law enforcement folks within the law,” he said. “People that do [go to protests] should be able to exercise their rights.”\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Elias was also not given a reason for his arrest and was told by jail officials he was not “permitted” to have an attorney present at the arraignment per “jail policy.”\n\nThe lawsuit also states that Elias’ sign was confiscated and that he was arrested for the “purpose of chilling his First Amendment rights and in retaliation for his exercise of those rights.”\n\nChristine Elzer, the attorney representing Melson and Elias, said peaceful protest is one of the most “fundamental” rights in the United States and that arrests like theirs are a “threat to free speech everywhere.”\n\nElias and Melson demanded a jury trial and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nEmber Duke is an editorial intern at Pittsburgh’s Public Source.

Minnesota police are spending countless hours dealing with the chaos ICE is causing,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"This federal invasion of the Twin Cities has to stop, so today I am suing DHS to bring it to an end.\"\n\nNoem announced the surge in an interview on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\n\n\"We're sending more officers today and tomorrow,\" Noem said Jan. 11. \"They'll arrive, there'll be hundreds more in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely.\"\n\nHomeland Security’s deployments to Minnesota come amid nationwide protests over the killing of Renee Nicole Good and more than a month after federal authorities began sending agents to the state as part of an operation targeting undocumented immigrants and fraud in social services programs.\n\nHearings have not yet been set in either case, according to federal court records in Minnesota and the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nMinnesota AG blasts Noem over 'federal invasion'\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Ellison sued Noem and other top DHS officials, including Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino.\n\nState officials are asking the federal court in Minnesota to stop \"the unprecedented surge of DHS agents into the state and declare it unconstitutional and unlawful.\"\n\nEllison said in a statement that he is asking the court to act immediately, saying the federal agents pose an immediate threat to Minnesota: \"The unlawful deployment of thousands of armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents is hurting Minnesota.\"\n\nIn addition to Good’s death, Minnesota officials say Homeland Security’s operation in the state has forced schools to go into lockdown, businesses to close and diverted police from regular duties.\n\nNoem says the deployments are necessary to \"root out this rampant fraud.\"\n\n\"For years, these corrupt, activist politicians have refused to protect Minnesotans,\" Noem said in a statement. \"We will root out this rampant fraud, we will arrest the criminal illegal aliens hurting Americans with impunity, and we will hold those who aid and abetted this criminality accountable.\"\n\n'Occupiers rather than officers,' Illinois AG says of feds\n\nIllinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul in a statement called federal agents \"occupiers.\"\n\n\"Border Patrol agents and ICE officers have acted as occupiers rather than officers of the law,\" Raoul said. \"They randomly, and often violently, question residents. Without warrants or probable cause, they brutally detain citizens and non-citizens alike.\"\n\nThe state’s 100-page lawsuit recounts the tactics federal agents used during Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump administration's crackdown on the Chicago area.\n\nIllinois’ lawsuit cites the agency’s use of Black Hawk helicopters in storming a South Side apartment building, the fatal shooting by a federal agent of a Mexican immigrant and the use of tear gas near a children’s Halloween parade.\n\nState officials are asking the court to limit the tactics agents can use, including making arrests without warrants, using chemical weapons and concealment of license plates.\n\nHomeland Security’s activities in the Chicago area have slowed in recent weeks as agents have deployed to Minnesota. But Border Patrol Commander Bovino has vowed to return in force to the area.\n\n\"If you think we’re done with Chicago, you’d better check yourself before you wreck yourself,\" Bovino said in a statement.\n\nBovino is also named as a defendant in the Illinois lawsuit.\n\nGood shooting caught on video\n\nThe Jan. 7 shooting, which was caught on video, immediately sparked backlash against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement and has deepened divisions between federal and state authorities. The federal government says the agent acted in self-defense; Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and others say he acted recklessly.\n\nFootage shows multiple agents approach Good's SUV, which was stopped in the middle of the street. One officer tries to open the driver's side door as someone is heard yelling at her to get out of the car. Good briefly reverses before driving forward, then begins to turn right, away from the agents. As the vehicle moves forward, an officer standing near the front driver's side draws his gun and fires three times at close range.\n\nNoem, in several interviews Jan. 11, defended the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, and accused Good of \"domestic terrorism.\" Video analysis by USA TODAY shows Good's vehicle appeared to be turning away from the officer who fired on her.\n\nWhat to know about DHS’ deployment to Minnesota?\n\nIn the first week of January, the Department of Homeland Security announced a surge of 2,000 agents into Minneapolis and Saint Paul as part of the administration's deportation agenda and to investigate fraud. Federal officials describing the deployment called it the \"largest immigration operation ever.\"\n\nThe fraud investigations were launched after President Donald Trump seized on cases in Minneapolis, calling out Walz and going after the state's Somali community. Since 2022, federal prosecutors have charged more than 80 people in the schemes, many of them U.S. citizens of Somali descent.\n\nOfficials have not said how long the federal deployment would last.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said last week that it has arrested 1,500 undocumented immigrants since it launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.\n\nOver the weekend, thousands of people turned out for protests in Minneapolis. Though most of them remained peaceful, occasional flare-ups saw federal agents deploy pepper spray and tear gas. Videos also show federal agents, including Border Patrol officers, making immigration-related arrests.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nChristopher Cann is a national breaking news reporter for USA TODAY.

The demonstrations intensified after a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man accused of fleeing a traffic stop and attacking an agent, federal officials said.\n\nSince an immigration officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, last week, demonstrations against the Trump administration and ongoing immigration enforcement operations have erupted nationwide.\n\nState and local officials in Minnesota, who filed a lawsuit to halt the federal intervention, described ICE's actions as \"intolerable\" and called on protesters to remain peaceful. Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday also encouraged civilians to record ICE agents' conduct for \"future prosecutions.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which has sent about 3,000 federal agents into the Minneapolis area, dwarfing the local police presence, defended agents' actions and denounced local officials for not assisting immigration officers.\n\nVisual story: Video analysis shows how fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis unfolded\n\nLeavitt says Insurrection Act is a tool at Trump's disposal\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday lashed out at Democratic officials who have criticized federal law enforcement in Minnesota and touched on Trump's recent threat to invoke the Insurrection Act.\n\n\"The Insurrection Act is a tool at the president’s disposal,\" Leavitt said, speaking about the law that gives the president authority to deploy U.S. troops onto American soil. \"As you know, it's been used, sparingly, but it has been used by previous presidents in American history.\"\n\nShe went on to accuse Democratic officials of \"using their platforms to encourage violence\" against officers and agents in the area, though many leaders on the left have called for calm.\n\nCNN: News crew hit with pepper spray balls\n\nCNN said one of its crews has been hit with pepper spray balls while covering an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis.\n\nThe news agency said protesters were confronting ICE agents outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building on Thursday when someone threw what looked to be a water bottle at officials.\n\nSoon after that, CNN correspondent Julia Vargas Jones reported that protesters and the CNN crew “got hit with some projectiles with pepper spray.”\n\nThe Whipple building has become a hot spot for protesters, with multiple news outlets reporting that federal authorities used tear gas in an attempt to break up the demonstrations.\n\nFeds pulled over vans with staff, students in St. Paul: Reports\n\nFederal agents in St. Paul, Minnesota, this week have pulled over two vans carrying students and staff to school in separate incidents, district officials told multiple news media outlets.\n\nIn both instances on Jan. 12 and 14, “staff followed the district’s protocols, and both vans were able to continue to school without further disruption,” according to St. Paul Public Schools, reported CNN and FOX9.\n\nThe district said both vans were under contract and had the van company’s name on them.\n\n“We applaud the staff members onboard for keeping everyone calm and safe,” the district said.\n\nMeanwhile the school district is offering students the option for temporary virtual learning “for students who do not feel comfortable coming to schools at this time.”\n\nThe option will be available starting on Thursday, Jan. 22, and parents can sign on starting Thursday, Jan. 15.\n\nSchool has been canceled from Jan. 20-21 to allow staff time to prepare.

No one, including federal agents, is above the law.\"\n\nDHS identifies 3 men involved in 2nd immigration shooting\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Thursday identified three men who allegedly attacked an immigration agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, including a man who was shot by the federal officer.\n\nDHS says Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan immigrant, fled from federal agents in a vehicle and then on foot before he assaulted an agent.\n\nDuring the scuffle, two men from a nearby apartment, Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma, undocumented immigrants from Venezuela, \"attacked\" the agent with a \"snow shovel and broom handle,\" federal officials said.\n\nThe agent fired \"defensive shots,\" hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg, according to Homeland Security. The three men barricaded themselves in an apartment before being taken into custody. The agent and Sosa-Celis remain in the hospital, federal officials said Thursday.\n\nTrump admin must respond to Minnesota lawsuit by Monday\n\nMinnesota state prosecutors sued the Department of Homeland Security this week in an attempt to stop the ongoing immigration enforcement, describing it as a \"federal invasion.\" On Wednesday, a federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order to halt the operations.\n\nIn the hearing, U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez ordered the Trump administration to respond by Monday to Minnesota's complaints, saying she would rule after that, calling the issues raised by Minnesota's lawsuit \"enormously important.\"\n\n\"They deal with the very fundamental relationships between the government and the state and municipalities,\" she said.\n\n'Minnesota needs ICE to leave,' mayor says\n\nAfter Trump floated the use of the Insurrection Act, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey renewed calls on Thursday for federal authorities to leave the city.\n\n\"Minnesota needs ICE to leave, not an escalation that brings additional federal troops beyond the 3,000 already here,\" Frey said in a statement on X. \"My priority is keeping local law enforcement focused on public safety, not diverted by federal overreach.\"\n\nWalz to Trump: 'Turn the temperature down'\n\nWalz, in a statement on Thursday, asked the president to \"stop this campaign of retribution\" and urged residents to remain calm.\n\n\"I am making a direct appeal to the President: Let's turn the temperature down.

We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.\"\n\nNoem says she discussed Insurrection Act with Trump\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday that she has discussed the use of the Insurrection Act with President Trump.\n\n\"He certainly has the constitutional authority to utilize that,\" Noem told reporters. \"My hope is that this leadership team in Minnesota will start to work with us to get criminals off the streets.\"\n\nNoem also defended the actions of agents on the ground in Minnesota: \"Every single action that our ICE officers take is according to the law and following protocols that we have used for years,\" she said.\n\nThe tactics of federal immigration agents have come under intense scrutiny after the shooting of Good and growing skirmishes between federal officers and protesters. Videos have shown agents firing pepper spray from vehicles, pulling people out of cars and asking U.S. citizens for their IDs.\n\nShe added that there's \"No plans to pull out of Minnesota.\"From CNN's Amanda MusaA CNN crew was hit with pepper balls while at an anti-ICE protest in the Minneapolis area today.Demonstrators were confronting a large group of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building when an object was thrown at officials.“Just moments ago, we saw agents coming out of this building in formation and tried to clear protesters off of the street,” CNN correspondent Julia Vargas Jones told Jake Tapper this evening.“Soon after, some kind of projectile — looked to me like a water bottle — was thrown at these agents,” Jones said. “And then all of us, including our crew here, our CNN crew, got hit with some projectiles with pepper spray.”Arrests were recently made outside the federal building where anti-ICE protests have been happening daily, US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino told Fox News this afternoon.\n\nWhat is the Insurrection Act?\n\nThe Insurrection Act is a 1807 law that empowers a president to deploy the U.S. military to suppress events like civil disorder.\n\n“The Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy the military inside the United States and use it against Americans, making it one of the executive branch’s most potent emergency powers,” according to a 2022 report by the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nIt’s also one of the oldest emergency powers available to the president, the center says, dating to 1792. It gives Congress authority under the Constitution to “provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions,” and is the primary exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, the center's experts say, under which federal military forces are generally barred from participating in civilian law enforcement activities.\n\n– Kathryn Palmer and Kate Perez\n\nDeputy director of ICE says she's leaving the agency\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Madison Sheahan is leaving the agency, she said in a social media post on Thursday.\n\n\"Thank you, President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for your leadership and steadfast commitment to Defend the Homeland,\" she said in a post on X. \"I am proud of the work we have done to protect American families and I am grateful for the brave men and women serving at ICE.\"\n\nSheahan did not say why she was leaving her high-ranking post at ICE. Multiple news outlets, including Fox News and CBS News, reported Sheahan planned to run for U.S. Congress, citing unnamed officials.\n\nState investigators to probe second immigration shooting in Minneapolis\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Criminal Apprehension said it is launching a use-of-force investigation into the Wednesday night shooting of a Venezuelan man by a federal agent in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says the man fled officers in a vehicle but crashed into a parked car and then took off on foot. An officer attempted to take him into custody and a struggle ensued, the agency said. Two people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the agent with a snow shovel and broom handle, federal authorities say.\n\n\"Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg,\" Homeland Security said. \"All three subjects ran back into the apartment and barricaded themselves inside.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Criminal Apprehension had intended to probe the fatal shooting of Renee Good, but said the FBI blocked state authorities from investigating the incident.\n\nRecent ICE, Border Patrol shootings follow similar pattern\n\nImmigration agents have fired upon at least 10 people since August, USA TODAY has found. In each case, agents shot at drivers or into moving cars – a practice that has largely been discouraged by law enforcement because of risks to public safety.\n\nFootage of the incidents show agents swarming vehicles, smashing windows and trying to pry open car doors within seconds of approaching drivers. On multiple occasions, body camera video and cellphone footage has contradicted federal officials' initial claims about the shootings.\n\nPolicing experts and former law enforcement officials said many of the tactics being used by federal agents – from reaching into vehicles to stepping into the path of cars – are in stark contrast to well-known policing standards.\n\n“The growing number of incidents where we see agents resorting to deadly force without any reasonable basis is a recipe for disaster,” said David Harris, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who focuses on police procedure. “These actions,” he added, “don’t reflect the current thinking of law enforcement generally or best practices.”\n\nRenee Good's family speaks out: 'Beautiful light'\n\nRenee Good's family on Wednesday revealed new details about what she was doing in the hours leading up to the fatal shooting on Jan. 7 that sparked protests nationwide.\n\nIn statements where they called Good \"the beautiful light of our family,\" the woman’s four siblings, parents and their attorneys described the shooting as a result of a chance encounter after dropping off her 6-year-old child at school. According to the family and attorneys, Good and her wife, Becca Good, were driving in their car with their dog after dropping off their child when they came across federal agents in their neighborhood engaged in immigration action. The couple stopped \"to observe, with the intention of supporting and helping their neighbors,\" family attorneys said.\n\n\"We want to thank everyone who has reached out in support of Renee and our family. The kind of unending care we’ve been given during this time is exactly the kind that she gave to everyone,\" the family said in a letter shared with USA TODAY. \"Nae was the beautiful light of our family and brought joy to anyone she met. She was relentlessly hopeful and optimistic which was contagious. We all already miss her more than words could ever express.\"\n\n– Michael Loria\n\nThey sought justice for George Floyd. Now they march for Renee Good\n\nAlmost six years after former police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis, the city sits on a tinder box of sorrow and outrage. And activism.\n\n“We are completely retraumatized – people are deeply retraumatized,” former Minneapolis City Council President Andrea Jenkins said. “It’s like literally the same people, just six blocks from where George Floyd was murdered. It’s the same community, the same people, and the whole city.”\n\nRenee Good, a White mother, was fatally shot in her car on Jan. 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. It happened not far from where Floyd, a Black man, was killed.\n\nThings have changed since the days after George Floyd’s murder. There haven't been fiery and destructive protests. But the heart of the city is once again broken.\n\n“It’s just been relentless and people are exhausted,” Jenkins said.

Minneapolis is one of the largest urban centers for Native Americans in the United States. The cases include four men experiencing homelessness, according to the groups, and a man accused by ICE of \"violently\" assaulting an officer.\n\n“It is deeply offensive and ironic that the first people of this land would be subjected to questions around their citizenship,” Jacqueline De Leon, senior staff attorney at the nonprofit Native American Rights Fund and a member of the Isleta Pueblo. “Yet nevertheless, that is exactly what we’re seeing.”\n\nRead more here.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\n'This is not sustainable,' Minneapolis mayor says after shooting\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey renewed his call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to leave the city after a federal officer shot a man in the leg. He noted that the incident was the second shooting to occur in Minneapolis in a week, which has prompted public outrage and days of unrest in the city.\n\n\"This is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in,\" Frey said during a news conference Wednesday night. \"And at the same time, we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbors, to maintain order.\"\n\nThe mayor said residents have been asking a \"very limited number\" of local police officers to “fight ICE agents on the streets, to stand by their neighbors.”\n\n“We cannot be at a place right now in America where we have two governmental entities that are literally fighting one another,” Frey said, noting that the city only had about 600 officers while there were about 3,000 federal immigration agents in the area.\n\nFederal immigration agents 'creating chaos,' mayor says\n\nFrey said the presence of federal immigration agents throughout the city and across the state is \"creating chaos.\" Though the mayor reiterated his criticism over immigration enforcement operations, he also condemned hostile protests in the city and urged people to go home.\n\n\"I’ve seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable. If It were your city, it would be unacceptable there, too,\" he said during Wednesday's news conference.\n\nLocal media outlets reported that hundreds of protesters gathered near the shooting scene on Wednesday night, clashing with federal officers as they deployed gas and rubber bullets. While the mayor praised peaceful protesters, he urged residents to remain calm and discouraged violent demonstrations.\n\n\"We cannot counter Donald Trump's chaos with our own brand of chaos,\" Frey added. \"And I have seen thousands of people throughout our city peacefully protesting. For those that have peacefully protested, I applaud you. For those that are taking the bait, you are not helping, and you are not helping the undocumented immigrants in our city.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/09/ice-raids-los-angeles-protests-live-updates/84110835007/", "title": "Marines heading to LA; Newsom says move is Trump's 'deranged ...", "text": "June 9, 2025 Updated June 10, 2025, 12:44 p.m. ET\n\nEditor's note: This page reflects the news from ICE protests in Los Angeles on Monday, June 9. For the latest news on the LA protests, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Tuesday, June 10.\n\nLOS ANGELES − A tense standoff between California and the federal government escalated Monday, with federal officials preparing to send in 700 Marines to assist the National Guard and state officials saying they will sue the Trump administration's decision to \"trample over\" Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority.\n\nNewsom shot back at Trump over the move to send in Marines: \"U.S. Marines have served honorably across multiple wars in defense of democracy. They are heroes. They shouldn't be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfill the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President.\"\n\nThe addition of active-duty troops marks a significant escalation. It comes as California officials say they will sue the Trump administration, challenging the decision to federalize the National Guard and send its members onto city streets amid increasingly hostile protests over Trump's immigration policies, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday.\n\nIn addition to the Marines, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced on Monday that 2,000 National Guardsmen would be deployed to Los Angeles. The mobilization of additional troops comes after Trump authorized 2,000 guardsmen to be deployed to the city.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the Marines are being sent \"due to increased threats to federal law enforcement officers and federal buildings, approximately 700 active-duty... are being deployed to Los Angeles to restore order.\"\n\n\"We have an obligation to defend federal law enforcement officers - even if Gavin Newsom will not,\" Hegseth said.\n\nTrump said the troop deployment in Los Angeles is expected to last 60 days, according to California’s adjutant general.\n\nCalifornia governor says 'Trump wants chaos'\n\nAmid moves from the Trump administration to deploy as many as 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is firing back with all tools in his arsenal, including 800 additional officers, a lawsuit and invectives warning Trump is acting like a “dictator.”\n\n“Los Angeles: don’t take Trump’s bait. Trump wants chaos and he’s instigated violence,” Newsom said in a post on X. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don’t give him the excuse he’s looking for.”\n\nNewsom’s move to rally support comes after Trump ordered National Guardsmen to Los Angeles without the governor’s consent and after the president even suggested Newsom should be arrested.\n\n“This isn’t about public safety. It’s about stroking a dangerous President’s ego,” Newsom said in another post. “This is Reckless. Pointless. And Disrespectful to our troops.\"\n\nThe California governor has called out Trump’s moves to intervene in the city while also drawing a firm line with protestors: “Foolish agitators who take advantage of Trump’s chaos will be held accountable.”\n\nTrump and Newsom have often clashed, but the showdown over Los Angeles marks a new low in their heated relationship. In a lawsuit, Newsom says the Trump administration is violating California’s sovereignty.\n\n“One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit says. Trump “used a protest that local authorities had under control to make another unprecedented power grab, this time at the cost of the sovereignty of the State of California.”\n\nRead more about their feud here.\n\nMarines heading to Los Angeles\n\nA photojournalist for the Desert Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, spotted a convoy of Marines heading for Los Angeles Monday evening.\n\nFive buses and six to 10 armed vehicles passed Park Boulevard near Joshua Tree while heading west on Highway 62 — the main route from Twentynine Palms to Los Angeles — shortly after 7 p.m. At the nearby crosswalk, about 20 protestors were gathered demonstrating against the recent immigrations raids.\n\nThe movement of troops to the city comes just hours after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced 700 Marines would be \"deployed to Los Angeles to restore order.\"\n\nCalifornia state officials have fired back that federal troops are escalating the tension between law enforcement and protestors.\n\nProtests into the night\n\nSeveral crowds of demonstrators circled downtown Los Angeles, including City Hall and several federal buildings as helicopters paced the crowds from above. By 7 p.m. local time, the crowds numbered at least several hundred, snaking its way past cars and graffiti calling for ICE to be abolished.Car horns and sirens maintained a constant background symphony as protesters walked. Police officers periodically fired tear gas or pepper balls as a crowd sometimes moved too close to a protected building or someone threw a water bottle at them.Unlike the previous evening, local authorities appeared to have the area under firm control, although no one stopped people with spray paint from defacing public buildings.There was no visible sign of federal troops.\n\nLawsuit filed, alleges 'unnecessary, unlawful' actions by Trump\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Bonta announced details of the lawsuit against the administration, calling Trump's move \"unnecessary, counterproductive and most importantly unlawful.\" Bonta said Trump's order abused the federal government's authority and \"trampled over\" Gov. Gavin Newsom's sovereignty.\n\nTrump said the guard would restore order amid mounting violent clashes between police and protesters angry at his aggressive pursuit of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. illegally. On Monday, U.S. Northern Command confirmed 700 Marines would also be sent into the city.\n\nThe president pledged in a social media post to \"liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots. Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Newsom blamed Trump for the increase in unrest after three days of protests, saying \"we’re suing him.\"\n\n“Donald Trump is creating fear and terror by failing to adhere to the U.S. Constitution and overstepping his authority. This is a manufactured crisis to allow him to take over a state militia, damaging the very foundation of our republic,” Newsom said in a statement.\n\nPolice on Monday were urging businesses and residents to report any \"vandalism, damage or looting\" for documentation after some of the protests Sunday deteriorated into destructive clashes between officers and protesters. Some vehicles were set ablaze, protesters blocked the 101 Freeway, and a group of them converged on an overpass and threw objects down at police, video footage showed.\n\nAuthorities declared several of the demonstrations Sunday \"unlawful assemblies,\" sweeping in with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades to disperse hundreds of protesters. Police in riot gear were joined by hundreds of the California National Guard troops.\n\nNewsom calls in 800 police officers\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Monday that he would have an additional 800 state and local law enforcement officers deploy to Los Angeles.\n\nNewsom said the additional officers are being called in order to handle the protests stemming from the face-offs between protestors and national guardsmen that were sent in “illegally,” according to the governor’s office.\n\n“Chaos is exactly what Trump wanted, now we are sending in hundreds more law enforcement to pick up the pieces,” Newsom said. “State and local leaders stand together, coordinated and resolute to ensure the safety of the Los Angeles region.”\n\nKaren Bass, LA’s mayor, backed Newsom: “While Washington choreographed these chaotic events, the LAPD and local law enforcement continue to effectively respond.”\n\n700 Marines sent to LA\n\nThe Pentagon is sending 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration sweeps by the Trump administration, according to U.S. Northern Command spokesperson Col Kelly Frushour.\n\nFrushour said the troops belong to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment and are based at Twentynine Palms, about 140 miles east of Los Angeles. The California-based Marines will join the 2,100 federalized National Guard troops \"protecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area,\" Frushour added.\n\nMarines heading to Los Angeles are from an infantry battalion whose typical mission is close combat with enemy forces. But for this mission, Frushour said, the activated Marines and Guardsmen \"have been trained in de-escalation, crowd control, and standing rules for the use of force.\"\n\nThe Marines will be moving out within hours, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Marines had been on standby since Saturday, according to U.S. Northern Command, which is in charge of the operation that also includes California National Guardsmen. Like the Guard troops, the Marines will be used to protect federal property.\n\nThe addition of active-duty troops is a significant escalation in the administration’s ongoing efforts to round up those who have violated immigration laws. There are thousands of active-duty troops assisting at the southern border but none inside a major U.S. city.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook, Davis Winkie\n\nGov. Newsom files lawsuit against Trump over California ‘sovereignty’\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit on Monday against President Donald Trump over the president’s move to deploy members of the California National Guard without Newsom’s consent. The process is called federalizing the National Guard.\n\nThe Office of the California Attorney General shared a copy of the lawsuit with USA TODAY late Monday afternoon local time.\n\n“One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit says. Trump “used a protest that local authorities had under control to make another unprecedented power grab, this time at the cost of the sovereignty of the State of California.”\n\nTrump authorized 2,000 National Guardsmen on June 7 to deploy to Los Angeles and on June 9 Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered another 2,000 to the city, according to the lawsuit.\n\n50 arrests, 600 non-lethal bullets fired: LAPD\n\nOfficials at the Los Angeles Police Department announced that they had arrested 50 people over Saturday and Sunday in downtown areas that “escalated into significant acts of violence, vandalism, and looting.”\n\nLAPD said 29 people were arrested Saturday evening for failing to follow orders to disperse. 21 people were arrested Sunday on charges from attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail to assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, LAPD said.\n\nAuthorities said officers used tear gas on the “hostile crowd” as well as over 600 rounds of non-lethal bullets. Among those hit was an Australian journalist covering the protests.\n\nAt least five officers received minor injuries, according to LAPD. Five police horses also “were targeted and sustained minor injuries.”\n\nPolice said protest groups used handheld radios “to coordinate and evade law enforcement.”\n\nLAPD said its Professional Standards Bureau will investigate excessive use of force allegations.\n\nWatch officer fires non-lethal bullet at journalist\n\nAn Australian journalist was shot with a rubber bullet by an officer while covering protests in Los Angeles over the weekend, according to her media outlet.\n\nLauren Tomasi, a U.S. national correspondent for Australia's 9News, was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet while reporting on the immigration raids and ensuing protests in Los Angeles on Sunday, June 8, the network reported.\n\nVideo captured by 9News shows a nearby armed police officer aiming a weapon at Tomasi before firing, striking the back of her left leg. Tomasi is heard yelling out in pain as the camera pans away.\n\nTomasi is sore but otherwise unharmed from the incident, 9News reported.\n\n- Greta Cross\n\nWhy burning EVs like Waymos isn't a good idea\n\nMultiple Waymo self-driving robotaxis were set on fire in Los Angeles during the protests. Other cars were also put to the torch but the Waymos have garnered special interest, partially because they're something new on the scene and partially because as electric vehicles, they raise different and specific concerns if their batteries burn.\n\nElectric vehicle fires can burn hotter and more intensely than gasoline-fueled cars, if their batteries catch fire.\n\nThe fires also release different emissions than traditional gasoline-powered vehicle fires, including gases such as hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and metal-based particulates.\n\nEV fires are also more difficult to put out than ones in gasoline-powered cars and require different firefighting techniques, which firefighters are trained on.\n\n- Elizabeth Weise\n\nGlendale scraps deal with ICE\n\nThe City of Glendale, about 9 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, announced it would be terminating its contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold federal immigration detainees at the local police facility, city officials said in a news release Sunday night. ICE’s agreement with Glendale had been in place since 2007, according to the release.\n\n“(The) City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” the statement said.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Homeland Security responded to the announcement on X, saying ”Glendale’s politicians stand with criminal illegal aliens, including gang members, rapists, and murderers over American citizens.”\n\n“It is deeply disturbing that sanctuary politicians in Glendale, California, would terminate an agreement to hold ICE detainees and violent criminals — which the city has had with DHS for more than 15 years — just as violent rioters are looting and defacing Los Angeles and assaulting federal law enforcement,” DHS said.\n\n- Victoria Valenzuela\n\nCelebs speak out on LA protests\n\nSeveral stars have taken to social media to share information and resources, and to criticize the federal response to what they called peaceful demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nOn June 8, Billie Eilish's brother and collaborator, Finneas, posted on his Instagram story about the protests, cursing at ICE and sharing that he attended a protest and was immediately met with force.\n\n\"Tear gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown ‒ they're inciting this,\" wrote the songwriter, an LA native.\n\n-Taijuan Moorman\n\nCalifornia to sue Trump administration over National Guard deployment\n\nBonta, the California attorney general, confirmed June 9 that the state plans to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its \"unlawful\" decision to deploy National Guard troops in Los Angeles against Newsom's wishes.\n\nBonta said that by the time the first few hundred troops arrived in Los Angles \"the protests had mostly dissipated and streets were mostly quiet and calm.\" After the troops were deployed, Bonta said the situation escalated and unrest grew, \"causing highways to close and putting people in danger.\"\n\nThe order violated the 10th Amendment and failed to meet the criteria required to invoke the law, according to the attorney general. Bonta said the move marks the first time a president has invoked this statute since President Richard Nixon ordered the National Guard to deliver mail during the 1970 Postal Service Strike.\n\n\"They unlawfully invoked a law that's intended to prevent an invasion by a foreign nation or a rebellion or local and state law enforcement make it so that the laws of the United States cannot be executed,\" Bonta said. \"Those are the only three triggers that would provide for the invocation of the National Guard, and none of them were present here.\"\n\nWhen asked about Trump's suggestion that Newsom should be arrested, Bonta defended the governor's actions and downplayed the possibility.\n\n\"It is the president and the Trump administration that is consistently and frequently, blatantly and brazenly violating the law, not Governor Newsom,\" Bonta said. \"So it's a seems to be more of bluster and threat.\"\n\nSan Francisco joins in protests\n\nIn San Francisco, three separate protests against immigration arrests were scheduled for Monday, June 9.\n\nThe first took place at noon at the California State Building, a few blocks from City Hall. It was called by the Service Employees International Union, whose California president, David Huerta, was arrested Friday in the Los Angeles protests. Attendees were urged to wear their union colors.\n\nA second protest was scheduled to be held at San Francisco City Hall at 4 p.m. local time and was organized by multiple local progressive groups.\n\nFinally, at 6 p.m. a protest was scheduled to be held at the 24th street BART subway plaza in San Francisco’s Mission District, which is the heart of the city’s Hispanic community.\n\nThe protests in San Francisco come as several Waymo self-driving taxis were attacked and burned in Los Angeles during protests on Saturday, June 7. The city in Northern California is home to the largest number of the self-driving cars, where they are a common sight on roadways.\n\nWaymo told USA TODAY while the company was still operating and serving riders in San Francisco, out of an abundance of caution it was limiting trips in certain areas where protesters may be gathering.\n\n- Elizabeth Weise\n\nLA day laborers don't fear ICE raids\n\nWhile national attention focused on Los Angeles, it was business as usual for virtually everyone in the city.\n\nOutside the Home Depot in the Paramount neighborhood, a small group of day laborers in paint-stained pants sat on buckets waiting for work. Several said ICE had detained people across Alondra Boulevard on June 7, sparking unrest.\n\nThey said that although they lacked papers to remain legally in the United States, they weren’t worried about being deported if ICE agents returned. Mexican-born Jose Luis Valencia, 54, said if it’s his time to go back to his home country, he’ll go.\n\n“We’re not thieves,” he said. “We’re just looking for jobs.”\n\nLA resident says city is still 'very peaceful' amid protests\n\nLongtime LA resident Ira Long, 67, said the reporting of the unrest has been overblown. Long, a pastor at the Alondra Church of Christ in Compton, said he still remembers when the National Guard was called out in the wake of the 1992 Rodney King riots.\n\n“That was a really, really terrible time. Right now I don’t feel any of that tension or anxiety,” said Long, a retired special education teacher. “But people are uneasy, and there’s a real sense of loss because we have lost people who were a part of this community.”\n\nSpeaking as church volunteers prepared to distribute food to community members about a half mile from where weekend protests erupted, Long said he wants the rest of the country to know Los Angeles is a good, safe city.\n\n“This is a very loving community,” he said. “It’s never been totally out of control. It has its challenges, its issues. But there are also amazing and fantastic families who make this a great place to live. It’s very peaceful. And right now it’s pretty cool.”\n\nImmigration enforcement protesters rally outside Justice Department\n\nDozens of protesters rallied outside the Justice Department’s headquarters in Washington to criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the National Guard.\n\n“Enough of these mass ICE raids who are sweeping up innocent people,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said June 9. “Enough of the undermining of due process.”\n\nThe Service Employees International Union organized the protest after the union’s California president, David Huerta, was arrested in the Los Angeles protests. Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told KNBC, Huerta allegedly obstructed law enforcement vehicles from getting into a facility where they were conducting a search warrant, citing video of the arrest.\n\n“They tried to move him and then he got into a physical altercation with one of our agents and he resisted and he had to be pepper sprayed and subdued,” Essayli said.\n\nParticipants at the Justice Department protest held signs that said, “Free David. End ICE Raids” and “Justice for David Huerta Now.”\n\nThe rally was one of more than a dozen scheduled in cities across the U.S. to demand Huerta’s release and an end to workplace immigration raids, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\n'I would': Trump says he'd arrest Newsom\n\nAmid the mounting legal clash between the federal government and the state of California, Trump suggested that his border czar Tom Homan should arrest Newsom.\n\n“I would do it … I think it’s great,” Trump said when asked if Homan should arrest the governor, who has challenged the administration’s mobilization of National Guard troops to crack down on violent protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\nArresting Newsom, who responded to Homan’s threat by daring the feds to arrest him in a June 8 social media post, would represent a major escalation of the state’s widening rift with the Trump administration.\n\n− Davis Winkie\n\nNewsom warns that Trump could try federalizing Guard 'in any state'\n\nLAPD Chief Jim McDonnell called the outbreak of violence \"disgusting\" and said it had grown worse Saturday. He said he does not believe the same people who were genuinely protesting immigration policy were involved in the violence.\n\nNewsom warned that violent protesters would be arrested and prosecuted. He also kept up his social media attack on Trump, saying California \"didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved\" and that unrest is \"exactly\" what Trump wanted.\n\n\"Let’s get this straight: 1) Local law enforcement didn’t need help. 2) Trump sent troops anyway — to manufacture chaos and violence. 3) Trump succeeded,\" Newsom wrote. \"4) Now things are destabilized and we need to send in more law enforcement just to clean up Trump’s mess.\"\n\nFamilies of detainees plead for release of loved ones\n\nFamily members of several people detained last week in an ICE sweep pleaded for the release of their loved ones at a press conference Monday. Elaina Jung Hee Vermeulen, with the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, said she attempted on Sunday to meet with some of the detained warehouse workers.\n\n\"Instead of allowing me to meet with community members, they jumped onto trucks in riot gear,\" she said. Vermeulen urged local leaders to protect the rights of working class immigrants and said ICE must be banned from entering workplaces.\n\n\"Every single person who is here, who is figintg for a better life for their family, deserves to have their rights protected,\" she said.\n\nNoem explains reversal on federalizing National Guard\n\nAs South Dakota governor in February 2024, Kristi Noem threatened then-President Joe Biden when Democrats said he should federalize the National Guard in Texas to disrupt that state governor's anti-immigration efforts.\n\nIf he did, Noem warned, Biden would be mounting a “direct attack on states’ rights,” and sparking a “war” between Washington and Republican-led state governments, she said in a Feb. 6, 2024 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nOn June 8, Noem − now Trump's Homeland Security secretary − cheered Trump for doing the same thing to the Democratic governor of the state of California.\n\nOn CBS News' Face the Nation Sunday, Noem explained her reversal by saying, \"Governor Newsom has proven that he makes bad decisions.\" Read more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer\n\n‘Trump didn’t start’ riots: California sheriff rips Harris’ comments\n\nA California sheriff running for governor isn’t pleased with former Vice President Kamala Harris’ reaction to the explosive protests. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said in a June 8 post on X that Trump is \"not out there lighting cars on fire, hurling projectiles at law enforcement or blocking freeways.”\n\nThe sheriff, whose county is just north of San Diego and the fourth-most populous county in the state, was responding to Harris’ earlier statement where she said the deployment of the National Guard was \"meant to provoke chaos.”\n\nHarris, who is mulling a bid for California governor next year, put much of the blame on the Trump administration’s ICE raids and a \"cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\"\n\nBianco, who is also running for governor in 2026, is a long-standing Trump supporter who gained a bit of attention in 2021 for vowing not to enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates in his office.\n\nHe said Sunday the former VP’s comments were “an embarrassment.\"\n\n“The Democrats and their ‘leaders’ own this,” Bianco added.\n\n− Phillip M. Bailey\n\nLatinas for Trump co-founder blasts Trump immigration policy\n\nFlorida state Sen. Ileana Garcia, who co-founded the group Latinas for Trump, criticized his administration's recent immigration enforcement actions as “unacceptable and inhumane” in a post on X.\n\nHer remarks come as federal agents have arrested immigrants in courthouses across the U.S., including Florida, stripping them of due process protections, as NBC News reported.\n\n“I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings − in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims − all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,” she wrote in her post, referring to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\n\nShe said she stands with Florida Republican Rep. María Elvira Salazar, who wrote in a statement June 6 that “anyone with a pending asylum case, status-adjustment petition, or similar claim deserves to go through the legal process.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBorder czar denies threatening to arrest Newsom\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan on Monday denied ever calling for the arrest of Newsom. Homan told Fox News that he was asked if Newsom or Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass could be arrested and Homan responded that, if they commit a crime, they could be arrested.\n\n“There was no discussion about arresting Newsom,” Homan said.\n\nNewsom had addressed the issue on social media, saying that \"Trump’s border czar is threatening to arrest me for speaking out. Come and get me, tough guy. I don't give a damn. It won’t stop me from standing up for California.\"\n\nProtesters flee tear gas grenades\n\nAt 8 p.m. local time on Sunday, authorities declared the protest to be an unlawful assembly and moved in aggressively with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades.\n\nThat sent hundreds of people running, their eyes streaming with tears. Helicopters clattered overhead as protesters fled the area to the honking of car horns and periodic cheers.\n\nAccording to preliminary information, police said at least 10 people have been arrested and three officers were injured during protests on Sunday. California Highway Patrol arrested 17 people on the 101 Freeway, police said. On Saturday, police arrested 29 people.\n\nRecent ICE sweeps sparked protests in Los Angeles\n\nThe protests began Friday after Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps in the area resulted in more than 40 arrests. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the raids and said those arrested by ICE included a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\n\"These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets,\" McLaughlin said in a statement. \"Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer.\"\n\n60 arrested after San Francisco protest\n\nProtests against immigration enforcement policies were not limited to the Los Angeles area. In San Francisco, a demonstration that drew hundreds ended with violence and about 60 arrests, police said.\n\n\"Individuals in the group became violent and began to commit crimes ranging from assault to felony vandalism and causing property damage,\" San Francisco police said in a statement. An unlawful assembly was declared and many left the scene while others vandalized buildings and police cars. Two officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\n\n\"Individuals are always free to exercise their First Amendment rights in San Francisco but violence especially against SFPD officers - will never be tolerated,\" the statement said.\n\nVideos show Waymo cars on fire amid LA protests; service reportedly suspended\n\nLos Angeles protesters set fire to Waymo self-driving cars\n\nPhotos and videos show several Waymo self-driving cars being torched during the protests.

JB Pritzker as hundreds of National Guard troops seemed poised to enter the city where tensions are boiling over the Trump administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\n\"Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform on Wednesday, Oct. 8, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel.\n\nPritzker responded defiantly, writing on X, \"I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?\" Johnson said he's \"not going anywhere\" and added \"This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as hundreds of National Guard troops – 300 from Illinois and 200 from Texas – arrived in the greater Chicago area, according to U.S. Northern Command. The White House ordered their deployment on Oct. 4 over the vociferous objections of local and state leaders, who filed a lawsuit challenging the move.\n\n'Invasion of Illinois': Pritzker slams Trump troops headed to Chicago\n\nU.S. District Judge April M. Perry at an emergency hearing allowed the deployment to move forward but warned that any troop action before an Oct. 9 hearing could be used as evidence against the Trump administration. So far, soldiers were seen assembling at the Army Reserve Training Center in Elwood, a village about 45 miles southwest of Chicago.\n\nPritzker and Johnson for weeks have condemned increasingly aggressive ICE raids in the city and Trump's characterization of Chicago as \"the worst and most dangerous city in the world.\" Earlier this week, Johnson signed an executive order establishing an \"ICE Free Zone\" prohibiting federal immigration agents from using city property in their operations.\n\nThe nation's third-largest city has become the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration's intensifying deportation campaign and crackdown on crime in Democratic-led cities. Trump this week floated the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act if judges or leaders in blue cities continue to hold up National Guard deployments.\n\nProtests break out as ICE raids ramp up in Chicago\n\nTrump’s battle with Chicago has been stewing for more than a month, with the president threatening that the city would be next in line after deploying 800 National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., in August.\n\nTrump says his Chicago-area immigration crackdown, called Operation Midway Blitz, is needed to apprehend \"the worst of the worst\" criminal immigrants. The stepped-up enforcement has fueled a simmering powder keg, heightening tensions in the city and spurring ongoing protests, especially at the ICE processing center in the suburb of Broadview, where several protesters were arrested last weekend.\n\nThis week, groups of nonprofits, unions, journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration saying federal agents responded to demonstrations \"with a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians.\" Among the plaintiffs is a pastor who said federal agents shot him with pepper balls and sprayed him in the face with tear gas.\n\nProtests swelled in recent weeks as ICE has launched highly visible and aggressive raids across Chicago. On Sept. 30, immigration agents descending from Black Hawk helicopters stormed and wrecked a South Side apartment building in search of Venezuelan gang members. Two of the 37 people subsequently arrested were \"confirmed\" members of the Tren de Aragua gang, the Department of Homeland Security said.\n\nOn Oct. 4, a woman was shot by a U.S. Border Patrol in a clash between protesters and immigration officers on Chicago’s Southwest side, while according to the Chicago Sun-Times, masked federal agents unleashed a chemical irritant outside a Logan Square neighborhood grocery store where protesters had blocked their progress.\n\n'This is about consolidating power,' governor says\n\nPritzker has said the state \"won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator\" and called the activation of National Guard troops a \"manufactured performance.\"\n\n\"I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,\" he said on Oct. 4, posting on X that the War Department had given him an ultimatum: \"Call up your troops, or we will. It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.\"\n\nAccording to immigration authorities, more than 800 \"illegal aliens including worst of the worst criminals\" have been detained since the blitz began. But Illinois leaders fear Trump is using conflict between federal agents and anti-immigration enforcement protesters to justify troop deployment and to ultimately take control of the heavily Democratic stronghold.\n\n\"This is not about fighting crime, this is about sowing fear and intimidation among Americans,\" Pritzker said last month. \"This is about consolidating power in Donald Trump's hands.\"\n\nThe 500 National Guard troops staging outside Chicago will be tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel, including ICE agents operating in the area, according to U.S. Northern Command, which will oversee the deployment.\n\nThe Trump administration has included Chicago among blue cities and states whose federal funds are being withheld during the ongoing government shutdown. Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said that $2.1 billion in promised federal funds for Chicago's transit system have been paused.\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/08"}]}

Kennedy Jr. on Jan. 7 released new dietary guidelines that flip the traditional food pyramid to emphasize full-fat dairy, protein and \"healthy fats.\" Kennedy, announcing the changes, declared, \"We are ending the war on saturated fats.\"\n\n\"With this legislation, schools will finally be able to expand their offerings to include nutritious whole milk,\" Trump said. \"It's the perfect follow-up to the new real food pyramid.\"\n\nThe bill is the first legislation Trump signed in 2026. Under the new law, schools participating in the National School Lunch Program ‒ which provides meals for nearly 30 million students, including 21 million at free or reduced prices ‒ can offer students whole, 2% milk or nondairy beverages that are \"nutritionally equivalent\" to milk, in addition to reduced-fat and fat-free milk.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said it should take only \"a few weeks\" before whole and 2% milk are offered in schools.\n\nThe law overhauls school milk standards set in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, signed by former President Barack Obama, that limited milk in schools to reduced-fat options in a push to fight the nation's childhood obesity epidemic.\n\n\"President Trump will sign into law a fix to the failed Obama policy that foolishly banned whole milk from public schools and barred children from the essential nutrients needed to grow, learn, and stay healthy,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. \"This is common sense and great news for America’s children, dairy farmers, and parents who deserve choice, not big government mandates.\"\n\nRogers added that Trump is \"delivering on his commitment to Make America Healthy Again!”\n\nThe new law permits both flavored and unflavored milk and organic and nonorganic milk and applies to school breakfasts and lunches. In addition, the new law will allow parents to sign off on their children receiving a substitute for milk due to dietary restrictions because of disability. The current law requires a written statement from a doctor.\n\nSince unveiling the dietary guidelines, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has encouraged Americans to drink whole milk through a new promotional campaign featuring Trump sporting a milk mustache.\n\nAn image posted by the USDA on X, accompanied by the hashtag \"#DrinkWholeMilk\" shows Trump looking into the camera while leaning against his Oval Office desk with a glass of milk.\n\nReminiscent of the \"Got Milk?\" ads of the 90s and 2000s, Trump can be seen in the apparently edited image with a line of milk on his upper lip beneath the title, \"The Milk Mustache Is Back. Drink Whole Milk.\"\n\nPrevious nutrition guidelines suggested minimizing or avoiding full-fat dairy and all types of fat, including healthy and saturated. The new guidance recommends three servings of full-fat dairy a day but caps saturated fat at 10% of daily calories per day.\n\nEating too much high-fat dairy can easily add up to the daily 10% threshold, according to health experts. But fat is not always a bad thing.\n\nWhole dairy contains more nutrients (including protein, calcium, phosphorus and vitamins A, B and D), more essential omega-3 fatty acids and helps people feel full for longer. Reduced-fat dairy options, on the other hand, offer many of the same nutrients while contributing less saturated fat to your diet.\n\nContributing: Mary Walrath-Holdridge of USA TODAY\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/12/09/fda-red-food-dye-3-ban/76857859007/", "title": "Will FDA ban red dye 3?

While the FDA has claimed that red 3, like other additives the agency has approved, can be safe to consume, advocates have long called for its ban amid concerns that the food dye is linked to cancer and behavioral problems in children.\n\nAt a U.S. Senate hearing last week, Jim Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, said it’s been more than a decade since regulators have evaluated the safety of the synthetic color additive.\n\n“With red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks, we’ll be acting on that petition,” Jones told a health committee Thursday.\n\nWhat is red dye No. 3? Lawmakers, advocates call for ban\n\nRed No. 3 is a color additive made from petroleum that gives foods and drinks a distinctive bright red coloring.\n\nThe food dye, which is largely banned in the European Union, has for years drawn the ire of advocates, public health groups and lawmakers due to scientific studies linking it to health issues.\n\nRed No. 3 has been linked to hyperactivity in children and has also been found to cause cancer in animals, although there is not enough research linking the additive to cancer in humans.\n\nConsumer Reports, an advocacy and research nonprofit, in 2023 called on the maker of Peeps candies to stop using red No. 3 in its products. Additionally, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer food safety organization, was among 24 groups and scientists that joined Consumer Reports in starting a petition in 2022 calling on the FDA to formally remove red No. 3 from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines.\n\nFollowing last week's senate hearing, Frank Pallone, Jr., D-N.J., joined a growing list of lawmakers urging the FDA to ban the food dye.\n\n“There is simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the color of their food so it looks more appealing,” Pallone said in a statement. “With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating.\n\nDoes the FDA regulate red dye No. 3?\n\nWhile red No. 3 has been banned from cosmetics in the U.S. since 1990, the dye – one of nine synthetic dyes approved for use in the U.S. – remains in food products.\n\nHowever, the FDA has two regulations for the use of red No. 3 in American products, one for food and one for ingested drugs.\n\nFDA regulations specify the products in which additives like red No. 3 can be used, the maximum amounts allowed and how food dyes should be identified on food labels.\n\nIn 1990, the FDA banned red No. 3 from cosmetics and topical drugs under the Delaney Clause due to evidence that the dye is carcinogenic at high doses to lab rats. However, because the additives have not been found to cause cancer in humans, the FDA has not taken action to ban them from food.\n\nThe FDA has been reviewing that clause under a petition filed in 2022 by a slew of public health groups.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr, Trump's health secretary pick, blasts additives\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination for health secretary, has spoken about the potentially harmful impacts of food dyes in American food.\n\nKennedy, who has not specified what he would do to address artificial food dyes if confirmed to the post, has a reputation for being critical of the FDA and modern medicines.\n\nKennedy has also in the past questioned the efficacy of vaccines and the origin of COVID-19. He's also spread unfounded claims about a link between childhood vaccines and autism, and he proposed the removal of fluoride from drinking water\n\nAfter California ban, states take action\n\nIn 2023, California became the first state in the nation to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of four food additives commonly found in thousands of products across the United States, including red No. 3.\n\nIn a separate act passed this year, California moved to ban six of the nine FDA-approved artificial food dyes in public school food and drinks by 2027. The bill did not include red No. 3.\n\nSince then, more states have followed suit with bills of their own targeting the use of food additives, including Illinois and New York.\n\nThe Illinois State Senate in April passed a bill that would ban red No. 3, along with three other chemical additives, sending it next to the state House for consideration.\n\nNew York legislators also introduced a bill in February that would ban red No. 3 in food and drinks in the state.\n\nIn the past decade, bills targeting red No. 3 and other food dyes have been introduced in Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, and West Virginia, according to the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit.\n\nFood manufacturers and industry groups have long been critical of such restrictions.\n\nIn a news release responding to the Illinois bill, the National Confectioners Association said \"It’s time to stop pretending that Illinois state legislators have the scientific expertise to make these very important regulatory decisions.\"\n\n\"Usurping FDA’s authority does nothing but create a patchwork of inconsistent requirements that increase food costs, create confusion around food safety, and erode consumer confidence,\" the association said in a statement.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman, Alyssa Goldberg\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

West Virginia is taking soda out of food stamp programs and outlawing chemical dyes. Utah is removing fluoride from water. Arizona has banned ultra-processed food in public school cafeterias.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again movement, which focuses on ending what President Donald Trump's health secretary calls the “chronic disease epidemic,” is finding success in state capitals as lawmakers and governors take up or oppose health-related measures ranging from vaccine \"advisories\" to food safety.\n\nBut Kennedy's supporters aren't following a simple partisan formula. They are opposing a Republican-backed bill in Tennessee that would limit the liability of pesticide companies, for example, while backing California Democrats on measures involving improved food quality for incarcerated people and limiting use of glyphosate, a herbicide linked to cancer.\n\nAt the federal level, Kennedy in his opening months on the job announced a plan to phase out artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply and directed his department to conduct studies aimed at identifying \"environmental toxins\" behind the rising rates of autism. His critics have hammered him over his views on vaccines and for making major staffing cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOutside of Washington, D.C., Kennedy's followers appear to be scrambling the country's stubborn red-blue divide.\n\nShifting from kind of 'woo-woo' to 'kind of trendy'\n\n“It’s considered less 'woo-woo' now,” said Emily Stembridge, a 39-year-old mother of three from Lehi, Utah, who recruited like-minded moms to lobby her Republican-dominated state to ban artificial food dyes from school lunches. “Now it's kind of trendy, and so, it was the time to strike.”\n\nStembridge, a Republican who grew up in a health-conscious family, says she was intrigued by Kennedy’s 2024 presidential run, which ended last August when he dropped out and endorsed Trump before landing a job in the new president's Cabinet. The way Kennedy talked about health during that White House campaign, with an emphasis on “moms and families,” spoke to her.\n\n“I’d never seen anyone in his position putting these issues in the forefront,” she said. “These are things a lot of us were recognizing in our day-to-day that no one else seemed to want to pay attention to.”\n\nStembridge, who calls herself a MAHA Mom, contacted Utah state Rep. Kristen Chevrier and urged the Republican to introduce a bill banning artificial dyes in public schools. The freshman lawmaker did not need much convincing. As a mother of three children with autoimmune issues, Chevrier said she is forced to shop at specialty stores or make everything from scratch.\n\n“The whole mindset of our nation has shifted,” Chevrier said of her legislation, which Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed into law in March.\n\n'Dynamic change, state by state'\n\nKennedy's momentum at the state level has not surprised Del Bigtree, CEO of the MAHA Alliance Super PAC and of MAHA Action, a nonprofit which tracks legislation throughout the country.\n\n“What you're seeing is what government does when the people are watching,” he said. “And now you are gonna see dynamic change, state by state, I believe, because Robert Kennedy Jr. is championing these issues.”\n\nThe other reason politicians are paying attention, Bigtree says, is they see MAHA Moms as a “powerful voting block.”“Moms are the most vocal voting block,” he said.\n\nKennedy this spring toured states that had passed MAHA-aligned bills and executive orders including West Virginia, Utah and Arizona. He visited Indianapolis for the launch of Gov. Mike Braun’s “Make Indiana Healthy Again Initiative,\" where the Republican signed nine executive orders that called for the examination of the health impacts of artificial dyes and additives and increasing residents’ access to local foods.\n\nAt the Indiana meeting, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV doctor whom Trump appointed to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was also present with Kennedy to put a MAHA stamp of approval on the governor's efforts.\n\nDuring last year's presidential campaign Trump described Kennedy as a longtime friend and called his endorsement a great honor.\n\n“I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines,” Trump said, at a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27, less than 10 days before he won the presidential election.\n\nNew laws in five states\n\nOthers have followed Trump and Kennedy's lead. Governors in at least five states have signed MAHA-aligned laws and more than 30 more bills have been introduced around the country.\n\nIn March, West Virginia became the first state to enact a sweeping ban on artificial food dyes and Utah led the nation in banning supplemental fluoride in the water supply. Florida lawmakers followed suit in a bill that passed last week that is now awaiting a signature from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. In April, Arizona banned ultra-processed foods in public school meals and purchases of soda using food stamps. The same month, Idaho banned soda and candy purchases using food stamps.\n\n\"Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement,\" said Republican Gov. Brad Little, adding that Kennedy had called it an act of patriotism. \"Idaho couldn’t agree more.\"\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai said the states' embrace of the MAHA agenda proved that \"everyday Americans support President Trump’s commonsense initiative.”\n\nWhile at least 11 Republican-controlled states are taking the lead on introducing MAHA-aligned bills, the advocacy group \"MAHA Action\" is also supporting Democrat-led bills in blue states. For instance, the group is backing California's Farm to School Program to improve student nutrition and a proposed bill in New Jersey banning the sale and application of the insecticide chlorpyrifos. People close to Kennedy, many of whom are former Democrats, say they see party lines blurring when it comes to health.\n\nCalifornia, led by two-term Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, was the first state to ban some artificial dyes last year. The state's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment found a potential link between these dyes and hyperactivity.\n\nMAHA: An 'awakening for the Republicans'?\n\nWill Cole, a functional medicine practitioner, has known Kennedy for almost a decade. A former Democrat who is now an independent, Cole said there’s a “realignment playing out in real time.”\n\n“I feel like it's an awakening for the Republicans,” he said, adding that the GOP has been “abysmal” when it comes to these topics.\n\nBefore the MAHA fever took hold, he would have been described as a \"crunchy leftist\" in certain Republican circles, said Cole, whom the actress and wellness mogul Gwyneth Paltrow credits with helping her on her health journey.\n\nBigtree, who grew up in Boulder, Colorado, favoring outdoor sports, natural food stores and a “very liberal” mindset, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"The entire idea of natural health and natural living and getting chemicals out of food used to be completely a liberal perspective,\" he said. \"And now, suddenly in one of the most amazing shifts we've ever seen, we're seeing dyes being removed by a Republican administration.\"\n\nBoth Bigtree and Cole talked about how after years of chasm, health care policy might finally be the unifying element between the two parties.\n\nDemocrats tried for decades to pass comprehensive healthcare legislation before finally succeeding without any GOP support in 2010 under President Barack Obama. That effort cost Obama's party control of the U.S. House of Representatives, while Republicans failed in their own bids to repeal the law. Kennedy's supporters say one crucial way in which their work differs is in its intense focus on prevention and understanding the root causes of chronic diseases along with making healthcare more affordable.\n\nThe policy team at MAHA Action is primarily focused on health-oriented bills at the state level because that's where most U.S. health policy is made, said Bigtree.\n\nHe said the \"incredible success\" of the MAHA movement at the state level is applying \"immense pressure\" on the U.S. Congress to follow suit. The organization is currently working with members of both parties in Congress to co-sponsor future bills, Bigtree said while declining to identify what legislation or which Democrats the organization was working with.\n\n\"Too soon,\" he said.\n\nCalley Means, an entrepreneur who serves as an advisor to Kennedy as a \"special government employee\" said MAHA is about transparency. Kennedy has accused Big Pharma and Big Food of keeping Americans sick for profit.\n\n\"It's about making sure the incentives of our health care and food systems are prioritized to American health,\" he said, adding that Kennedy would use \"his levers of power to spur transparency with the American people.\"\n\nCole said he believes the most important thing holding together the diverse coalition of people within the MAHA movement is \"freedom of speech and diversity of thought\" around health and medicine.\n\nKennedy’s Instagram account was taken down by its parent company Facebook in 2021, for sharing “debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.” Cole said the way speech around health was handled online by major technology companies became a “bonding cause” among classic liberals, moderates, libertarians and conservatives.\n\n“We are not gonna agree on everything. Many of us are gonna be socially liberal people,” he said. “So it'd be interesting to see how we can continue to work together.”\n\nCritics worry about RFK Jr. and MAHA movement's sway on public health\n\nPaul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he agrees with Kennedy's encouragement of bans on soda and candy from the food stamp program. But he said Kennedy's views on most other things are \"dangerous\" to children.\n\n\"He's an anti-vaccine activist. He's a science denialist, which is why I don't trust him with the science of food either because he's so willing to deny the science of vaccines,\" Offit said. \"Why is he suddenly going to be much more reasonable about science regarding anything else?\"\n\nTaking fluoride out of the drinking water, which Kennedy has encouraged states to do, will only increase cavities in that state, Offit said.\n\nTennessee state Rep. Dr. Brock Martin, a Republican, said seeing Kennedy assume the position of health secretary was one of the coolest things he’d seen in the new Trump administration. Back in his home state, Martin said one of his priorities will be to propose a bill that would help increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables in areas considered to be food deserts.\n\n“As a legislator, that's exciting because I know it's gonna drive cost down on health care,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, MAHA Action is opposing a GOP bill in Tennessee that would limit the liability of pesticide companies if they were not labeled as harmful by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “That is a tricky one for me because I'm in farmland where all my farmers who put food on the table are reliant upon that product,” Martin said. “I was kind of torn on that one. I didn't know honestly where I was gonna vote on it once it got there.”\n\nThe bill, which passed the state Senate, was held up in the House and has been tabled for now, he said.\n\nStembridge, the mother who pushed for the ban on artificial food dyes in Utah, met Kennedy when he visited her state to celebrate the passage of the bill.\n\n\"It was exciting because he's actually addressing the giant elephant in the room of humanity,\" she said. \"Like, America is sick and someone's finally pointing that out, and then saying, 'And what are we gonna do about it?'\"\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House Correspondent for USA TODAY.

Brett Guthrie is in a unique position to act.\n\nFour U.S. House members from Kentucky signed a letter in September urging Congress to keep older laws that allowed hemp to flourish intact. Guthrie was not among them.\n\nAfter a record 43 days, the federal government shutdown is over. President Donald Trump signed a bill approved in the House and Senate on Nov. 12 that will fund the government through January.\n\nBut for hemp farmers and others connected to the industry in Kentucky, the fight is just beginning.\n\nSlipped into the compromise was language backed by U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell that limits the amount of THC that can be included in hemp-based products to 0.4 milligrams. THC, an abbreviation of tetrahydrocannabinol, is the intoxicating chemical in marijuana, which has been legalized in several states but remains banned federally.\n\nMcConnell has said his aim was to close a loophole opened in a 2018 farm appropriations bill he supported that inadvertently allowed hemp-based products with intoxicating qualities to hit the market. Hemp has become big business in the years since, and industry advocates are up in arms about the looming crackdown — including U.S. Sen. Rand Paul and U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, who both opposed the measure.\n\nThe law is set to go into effect after a 365-day grace period to give farmers time to pivot. But industry members such as Jim Higdon, cofounder of Louisville-based Cornbread Hemp, say that timeframe is shorter than it appears.\n\n\"A year is a long time, but not for Congress,” he said, urging for more legislation to address the issue before the ban begins. “To get a bill through, it's going to take a sprint, but it's possible.\"\n\nThe shutdown bill and the future of the hemp industry\n\nKentucky has had its own hemp laws on the books, which would be superseded by the new federal legislation. The language McConnell backed makes several nationwide changes to hemp regulations, including limiting THC in hemp products to 0.4 milligrams, defining \"industrial hemp\" to clarify it applies to industrial applications or research and banning synthetic hemp products such as delta-8.\n\nMcConnell has said his aim is to protect kids from consuming dangerous intoxicating products, frequently pointing toward hemp products contained in packaging that mimics food items like Oreos and Funyuns. And his office noted more than 80 health and safety groups signed a letter sent to Congress in September urging lawmakers to close the loophole.\n\nThe Allen County Agency for Substance Abuse Policy and the Scottsville Allen County Faith Coalition were two Kentucky-based groups that signed the letter, which said the current federal definition of hemp \"has created serious challenges for regulators and public-health officials, while fueling widespread, largely unmonitored sales of highly intoxicating product.\"\n\nMeanwhile, NBC News reported Trump supports language in the bill concerning hemp, and Bowling Green Independent School District Superintendent Gary Fields has said he's optimistic the bill will help curb vaping by kids in Kentucky.\n\nPaul, though, has argued the legislation would all but destroy the hemp industry and wipe out laws approved by the state legislature. The Kentucky Department of Agriculture reports half of the commonwealth's 120 counties contain hemp farms, with nearly 5,000 acres producing the crop — and just 2.5% of the yield going toward products that would remain legal under the new law.\n\nSome Kentucky legislators have spoken up as well. Rep. Savannah Maddox, R-Dry Ridge, worked on state legislation that established the commonwealth's hemp laws and said the federal bill would \"disregard all that progress to take us back to prohibition — a policy that is proven not to work.\"\n\nAnd while Gov. Andy Beshear is rarely in agreement politically with Paul and Maddox, this is an issue where they share common ground. He hadn't reviewed the specific language ahead of his Nov. 13 weekly press conference, but he noted hemp is an \"important industry in Kentucky.\"\n\n\"We should have appropriate safety regulations around it, but we should make those regulations here in Kentucky, talking to the industry and making sure that we get that balance right,\" Beshear said. \"I think that we can protect our kids, I think that we can do the right thing to protect all of our people without handicapping an industry that supports a lot of people.”\n\nMassie is in Paul's corner and voted against the bill, with a spokesperson noting the hemp provision factored into his decision. Two other Republican U.S. representatives from Kentucky, Andy Barr and James Comer, signed a letter in September opposing changes to federal hemp laws but ended up voting in favor of the bill to reopen the government.\n\nAlex Bellizzi, a spokesperson for Barr, said the congressman believes \"ending the longest shutdown in American history, led by Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats, needed to happen.\" Barr is currently running for the U.S. Senate seat McConnell will leave open after his retirement next year.\n\n\"The hemp provision included in the bill doesn't take effect for a year,\" Bellizzi said. \"In the meantime, Congressman Barr will work to secure a path forward to protect consumers, grow businesses, and see this industry thrive.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey's signature was also on that September letter, and the Democrat from Louisville joined colleagues in his party in voting against the legislation. A Comer representative did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nU.S. Rep. Hal Rogers previously said he understands concerns from constituents but supported closing the 2018 loophole due to \"concerns about hemp products, like Delta-8 THC, that have ended up in the hands of high school students.\" The Republican voted in favor of the bill this week.\n\nThat brings us to U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, a key player for the future of the business. He did not sign the letter in September and voted in favor of the bill to reopen the government. His office did not immediately respond to a Nov. 13 request for comment, but Higdon said he could have the ability to save the industry.\n\nGuthrie, from Bowling Green, is chair of the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which Higdon said would be the appropriate body to take up a bill within the next year to take a closer look at hemp regulations and potentially pass new legislation.\n\n\"Chairman Guthrie has been open to hearing from us through this process, and he's becoming more educated in this space,\" Higdon said in a Nov. 13 interview, noting he'll visit Washington, D.C. next week to discuss hemp policy. \"... We're on 364 days. The president signed it last night, and they'll count that day.\"\n\nGrand opening? In this state of the hemp industry?\n\nHigdon's Cornbread Hemp, which he cofounded alongside his cousin Eric Zipperle, is the fastest-growing hemp company in America on the 2024 Inc. 5000 list. He's had Dec. 8 circled on his calendar for months.\n\nThe six-year-old company — which produces oils, topicals and gummies containing CBD, a nonintoxicating chemical found in hemp, a type of cannabis plant, as well as gummies and seltzers that are infused with trace amounts of THC derived from hemp — is gearing up for the public grand opening of its new 25,000-square-foot facility in Louisville.\n\nHigdon and Zipperle have created a facility that employs roughly 100 people, was projected to rake in $50 million in sales in 2025 and will soon be open to the public with a retail shop and tours.\n\nThink of it like a distillery tour, but for a hemp company.\n\n\"Come see it while it's legal,\" Higdon joked.\n\nOver the last few years, Higdon hasn't shied away from declaring Cornbread Hemp as a model business in the hemp industry, and one that other \"good acting hemp companies\" should follow.\n\n\"When we got started it was a David and Goliath story, and we knew that the only way we could compete was on quality,\" Higdon said. \"We pursued USDA certified organic products and innovated the first USDA certified organic gummies in this category ... that's been the foundation of our commitment to quality and the demonstration that we're going above and beyond and to a higher standard than most in the industry.\"\n\nAnd while Higdon largely points his finger at McConnell for allowing this state of play to arise, he finds at least one point where he shares a sentiment with the senator. Higdon doesn't want to see intoxicating hemp products in the hands of children, noting he's also advocated for a 21-and-older age gate for the products. Bad actors should be taken out of the market, he said, and there's \"no path to saving\" questionable synthetic products.\n\nHowever, Higdon said the largest consumer of his brand's products are women over the age of 65.\n\n\"The whole concept of marketing to children, I get that it happens, but from our perspective, it's not even our universe,\" Higdon said. \"Our universe is catering to women over 65 who cannot sleep. They love us.\"\n\nCornbread Hemp is already seeing a spike in orders as customers gear up for products to completely disappear in the future, if there is not a federal reversal.\n\n\"Right now, everyone's job is secure,\" Higdon said. \"In the short term, we're not scaling back anything.\"\n\nCornbread Hemp won't go away quietly. Higdon is heading to Washington, D.C. next week, and Zipperle is already working to diversify the product line, hoping to give the business legs to stand on as the future remains uncharted.\n\nIt isn't just the employees working inside the swanky new Cornbread Hemp facility that Higdon worries about.\n\nThe Kentucky farmers who grow hemp for the company also stand to suffer from the override of the 2018 legislation. Higdon said that while technically the farmers could continue to grow the crop, the market for it will essentially evaporate if Congress doesn't reverse course.\n\nKatie Moyer doesn't run a $50 million business. The Kentucky Hemp Association member from Western Kentucky processes about five acres of hemp seed and root annually on her farm in Crofton — \"it's not a huge amount, but we are a small business.\"\n\nJust a fraction of her sales go to products that will remain legal under the new bill, she said. She plans to \"get more involved in the animal bedding industry\" and \"focus on that 2% of my business that is based on roots, seeds and stock.\"\n\nKentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell is also worried about how this federal move stands to negatively impact farmers. Shell said he recognizes there were issues with the previous Farm Bill, but he wants to see hemp farmers protected and to not criminalize nonintoxicating CBD products in the state's hemp program.\n\n\"Kentucky’s farmers deserve stability and support as they work to grow and diversify their operations,\" Shell said in a Nov. 12 statement. \"We’ve seen strong progress in hemp production, including significantly increased acreage from last year — an encouraging sign of the industry’s resilience and potential.\"\n\nRight now, the future looks grim for hemp manufacturers like Cornbread Hemp. But Higdon remains hopeful a bill will get through Congress in the next 364 days to prevent the collapse of his business and the entire hemp industry.\n\n\"We have a real obligation to 100 employees ... and we've told them we're going to figure this out, and we've got to do that,\" Higdon said.\n\nTell us what you think.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/951562/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-28-dec-2020", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 28 Dec 2020 | The Week", "text": "1. Hospitals ‘under pressure’ as Covid soars\n\nHospitals in the south of England say they have seen a “real rise in pressure” as Covid infections continue to soar. Paramedics in London are now receiving almost 8,000 call-outs a day. As hospital admissions near the level of the first peak, a paramedic told the BBC that some patients had been treated in ambulance bays because of a shortage of beds. “It's been a horrendous time,” the paramedic said.\n\n2. Trump signs Covid relief bill\n\nDonald Trump has signed the coronavirus relief and spending bill, restoring unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and avoiding a partial federal government shutdown. The US president had initially refused to sign the bill, saying he wanted to give people bigger one-off payments but the delay meant that millions of Americans temporarily lost unemployment benefits. The package is worth $900bn.\n\n3. Brits ‘lose rights’ under Brexit deal\n\nBritons travelling to the EU have been warned they will no longer be able to enjoy free healthcare or escape roaming charges after Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal comes into force on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Institute for Public Policy Research says UK workers’ rights are at risk of being eroded under the trade deal.

More youngsters turning to God\n\nPeople in their late teens and early twenties are more likely to believe in God than those in their late twenties and thirties, according to a poll. Experts said members of Generation Z are facing less “stigma” from their peers for their religious beliefs. It is thought that the ease with which young people can access information about religion online may have also influenced the trend.\n\n9. Vaccines will bring ‘Roaring Twenties’\n\nThe rollout of Covid-19 vaccines will lead to a boom in Britain’s hospitality industry similar to the “Roaring Twenties,” a think tank has forecast.

Nonessential employees were off work since the shutdown began Oct. 1, and essential workers continued working without being paid during that time.\n\nThough the bill approved Nov. 12 only funds federal government operations through January, it specifically funds the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and military construction projects through the end of the fiscal year in 2026. That includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, meaning they would be paid out even in the event of another shutdown in early 2026.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Human Services had announced earlier on Nov. 12, before the House vote and the president's signature on the bill, that partial SNAP payments would begin going out to recipients immediately. The state said Nov. 17 that full payments would begin that day.\n\nTravel disruptions could take a while to unwind, even after the federal government halted its plans to cut flights at major airports.

The distribution will run from 10 a.m. until all allotted food is distributed.\n\nGates will open at 8 a.m. that day. Second Harvest asks the public not to arrive before then, because the church gate will be closed, and no early entry will be possible.\n\nSecond Harvest staff and volunteers will distribute items for a traditional holiday meal along other shelf-stable goods, fresh produce and frozen turkeys.\n\nThis distribution will provide food to 800 families. Each vehicle can receive food for up to two households. Second Harvest asks that those picking up for two households bring proof of address to confirm that they live at different addresses.\n\nFind other food distribution locations and food pantry hours on Second Harvest’s Get Help page, SecondHarvestETN.org/get-help/\n\nTennessee begins issuing full SNAP benefits for November\n\nFive days after the end of the federal government shutdown, Tennessee announced it would begin getting full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to recipients starting Nov. 17 at the direction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service.\n\nTennessee SNAP recipients who received a partial November benefit will get the rest of their payment for the month added to their EBT cards, Tennessee Department of Human Services announced in a news release.\n\nThose that hadn't received any November funds, as well as those normally paid on the 18th or later, will receive their full benefits.\n\nSNAP benefits for December will be issued in full on their normal dates, the release said.\n\nSNAP recipients can use the One DHS Customer Portal to view their latest case details at https://onedhs.tn.gov/csp.\n\nMcGhee Tyson Airport sees air travel returning to normal\n\nTravelers flying to or from Knoxville's airport by Nov. 17 could see few signs that the lengthiest shutdown in United States history had hit the aviation industry. Almost all flights were on time, according to McGhee Tyson Airport's online flight tracker.\n\nPeople catching connecting flights after leaving East Tennessee also faced fewer obstacles to a peaceful trip after the Federal Aviation Administration ended the cuts it had mandated at 40 major airports as of 6 a.m. Nov. 17.\n\nThe earlier cuts, which had prompted thousands of delays and cancellations even after the government shutdown ended on Nov. 12, were ordered as air traffic controllers and security screeners had continued working without pay for weeks. The cuts were lifted ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, which is is traditionally one of the busiest times for travel in the U.S.\n\nFlyover tradition returns to Neyland Stadium with end of shutdown\n\nTennessee football will have a flyover before it hosts New Mexico State at Neyland Stadium on Nov. 15 after the government shutdown ended, a UT spokesperson told Knox News on Nov. 13.\n\nIt is the first time UT has had a pre-game flyover since Sept. 20. The 43-day shutdown ended when U.S. House approved Senate-passed legislation Nov. 12 to fund the government and President Donald Trump signed it shortly after.\n\nThe flyover will include two F-35 fighters from the 58th Fighter Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTennessee to begin issuing partial SNAP benefits for November\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Human Services announced Nov. 12 it would begin processing partial SNAP payments that could be available as soon as that date, according to a news release.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service has directed states to issue 65% of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for November 2025.

How much will Second Harvest get?\n\nSecond Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee will receive $850,000 out of a $5 million pool of state funding for Tennessee's five food banks that was announced by Governor Bill Lee Nov. 4, 2025.\n\nWith federal benefit programs leaving families with less access to groceries during the government shutdown, the state committed to providing emergency dollars set to be distributed based on which regions have the highest populations of folks who use SNAP. Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee serves 18 counties in the area, including Knox County.\n\nSecond Harvest expects to receive the funds \"within the next week or so,\" Michael Torano, the nonprofit's chief marketing officer, told Knox News in an email on Nov. 10.\n\n“This support from the State of Tennessee will help tremendously with the incredible surge in demand for food we've experienced these past couple of weeks. We appreciate the support and continue to need more funding and help to ensure our East Tennessee neighbors receive nourishment during these critical times,” he said.\n\nCan you help? How to donate or volunteer at East Tennessee food bank amid SNAP lapse\n\nHow will Great Smoky Mountains National Park shift back to federal funding?\n\nWhile visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are enjoying a Nov. 10 snow, there is plenty of work being done behind the scenes with park management as officials wait for word on the status of the federal government shutdown.\n\nWhile the shutdown looks to be getting closer to ending, there is not yet a plan in place for how the park will reopen without local funding or how and when local funding will stop and federal funding begin.\n\nBeyond that, there are questions about how or even if Sevier County - and the rest of the local partners - will be repaid for funding the park since Oct. 3.\n\nDuring the 2013 government shutdown, the state along with Sevier and Blount Counties agreed to help keep the park open. By the time the agreement was in place, the government opened the following day and it only cost roughly $60,000, according to Friends of the Smokies. Still, it took Congress three years to approve reimbursements.\n\nLocal leaders announced Oct. 31 that the park would remain open through Jan. 4 with scaled-back operations, meaning restrooms, emergency services, campgrounds, Cades Cove, all visitor centers and picnic areas would remain open, but some staff would be furloughed.\n\nSupreme Court pauses ruling on full SNAP payments\n\nThe Supreme Court late Nov. 7 temporarily paused a lower court ruling that would have required the Trump administration to pay full Supplemental Food Assistance Program benefits for November promptly.\n\nIn response to an appeal by the administration earlier in the day, the Supreme Court issued an administrative stay, giving an appeals court more time to fully consider Trump's request, USA TODAY reported.\n\nThe administration had said it could make only partial payments, not transfer another $4 billion to states by Friday evening as ordered Nov. 6 by U.S. Distirct Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island.\n\nTrump administration says it will provide full November SNAP benefits - then appeals to Supreme Court\n\nAfter appealing a federal judge’s Nov. 6 order to provide full Supplemental Food Assistance Program benefits for November, the Trump administration said the next day it was working to issue full benefits to SNAP's 42 million recipients, USA TODAY reported.\n\nA memo from the Department of Agriculture said the agency is “working towards implementing November 2025 full benefit issuances.” The Friday memo said the department would “later today” make full funds available for the SNAP program.\n\nLate the same day, the Trump administration filed a last-minute appeal with the Supreme Court to block the court order requiring the release of full benefits, after the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to intervene, USA TODAY reported.\n\nThe agriculture department had said on Nov. 5 that SNAP recipients could receive up to 65% of benefits in November, rather than a maximum of 50% as it originally announced.\n\nRhode Island federal Judge John McConnell said in a Nov. 6 hearing the Trump administration has not worked quickly enough to release the funds.\n\nJudge orders federal government to pay full November SNAP benefits by Nov. 7\n\nDuring a Nov. 6 hearing, federal District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to fully cover federal food assistance for 42 million Americans in November by Nov. 7, CNN reported.\n\nThe Justice Department filed a notice to appeal the same day as the judge's ruling, USA TODAY reported.\n\nEarlier in the week Tennessee officials were still unsure when Supplemental Food Assistance Program benefits would be paid out to the one in 10 people relying on them, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Health and Human Services told Knox News on Nov. 5.\n\n\"States are required to recalculate November SNAP benefits using a revised formula, which will require time to implement,\" spokesperson Danielle Cotton said in an email. \"The federal government should reopen now, so that Tennessee families receive their full benefits.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Nov. 5 that SNAP recipients could receive up to 65% of benefits in November, rather than a maximum of 50% as it originally announced, USA TODAY reported.\n\nTrump earlier said his administration would not pay food assistance benefits until the federal shutdown ends. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later said the post didn't reflect plans to violate the rulings, saying, \"The administration is fully complying with the court order.\"\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Oct. 30 launched feedtn.org, a website where those relying on food aid can locate food pantries and those who want to help can find food banks to donate to and volunteer at.\n\nOn Nov. 4, Lee announced in social media posts that he would allocate $5 million in \"new state funding for food banks. Grants will be allocated based on SNAP populations\" across the state.\n\nMore than 690,000 Tennesseans were cut off from SNAP benefits Nov. 1.\n\nExtra $450M at federal level keeps WIC benefits flowing to infants and mothers\n\nAn infusion of federal funds this week will help Tennesseans continue to receive WIC benefits, at least for now.\n\n\"Tennessee WIC continues to operate, WIC Clinics are open, and participants can use their TNWIC Cards at authorized WIC vendors,\" Bill Christian, associate director of the Tennessee Department of Health's Office of Communication and Media Relations, told Knox News in an email on Nov. 3. \"Breastfeeding support and nutrition education programs are also continuing through WIC.\n\n\"The Tennessee Department of Health is closely monitoring the situation and will notify WIC participants and vendors in advance of any operational and program changes.\"\n\nThe WIC page on the state’s website was updated on Nov. 3 to read, “WIC is experiencing unpredictability in the timing of funding. However, thanks to emergency federal support, Tennessee’s WIC program remains open and is operating as normal.”\n\nOn Nov. 3, the National WIC Association learned that WIC had received $450 million in additional federal funding.\n\n“This additional funding is a welcome relief, but it is a stopgap, not a solution,” National WIC Association President and CEO Georgia Machell said in a statement.\n\n“Under ordinary conditions, these resources would cover roughly three weeks of operations. However, with other vital assistance programs like SNAP disrupted, demand for WIC is likely to surge, and states could exhaust these funds even faster. Families deserve to be able to count on both of these programs to put food on their tables.”\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − or WIC − provides free supplemental groceries, breastfeeding support and nutrition education for pregnant or recently pregnant women, breastfeeding women, infants and children younger than 5 and caregivers of children younger than 5 who fall under a certain household income level.\n\nGroceries covered by WIC include essentials for infants such as formula and baby food.\n\nIn Knox County, as many as 12,297 people are enrolled in WIC, according to the Knox County Health Department.\n\nWhich services for military veterans aren't available during the shutdown?\n\nSome specific offices and services for veterans offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs remain closed or unavailable during the government shutdown. Those are:\n\nVeteran career counseling and activities related to the transition assistance program\n\nThe GI Bill Hotline\n\nVA regional benefits offices, including Knoxville’s, which is in Nashville\n\nPublic affairs and veteran outreach\n\nThe printing of new presidential memorial certificates\n\nApplications processing for pre-need burials\n\nGrounds maintenance and the permanent placement of headstones at VA national cemeteries\n\nVA national cemeteries, including Knoxville National Cemetery, are still open for interments and visitation, and burials already scheduled will be held as planned, Richard Muñoz told Knox News in an email in October. Muñoz is the director of Mountain Home National Cemetery, which administers Knoxville National Cemetery. “Honoring our nation’s veterans and their families is our highest priority,” he said.\n\nAdditional veterans services that continue operate as normal during the shutdown are:\n\nProcessing of applications for headstones, markers and burial benefits at VA national cemeteries\n\nHealth care for veterans\n\nProcessing and delivery of VA benefits\n\nDecisions on veterans’ cases by the Board of Veterans’ Appeals\n\nOperation of contact centers and the Veterans Crisis Line\n\nTennessee to provide $5 million to food banks\n\nTennessee’s food banks will get a bit of monetary reprieve as they buckle down to support community members who need extra assistance during the shutdown.\n\nWith federal benefit programs leaving some families with more limited access to groceries, the state is providing $5 million in funding to its food banks, Governor Bill Lee announced in a Facebook post on Nov. 4. The emergency dollars will be distributed based on which regions have the highest populations of folks who use SNAP.\n\nMore than 34,600 SNAP recipients live in Knox County and there are nearly 700,000 in Tennessee.\n\n“We are grateful to the governor and to our legislators and all of our folks that are working really hard to help our communities, for this boost of support that's coming,” said Michael Torano, chief marketing officer at Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee, which is one of five food banks in the state and serves 18 counties across the region.\n\n“We're certainly excited for the effort that's being made and that it's coming in. Unfortunately, it's not enough, but something is certainly better than nothing, and it's going to go a long way on our shelves.”\n\nAs of 2:30 p.m. Nov. 4, Second Harvest had not heard how much of the funding it would receive.\n\nThe governor’s statement on social media directed Tennesseans to FeedTN.org to find available resources or ways to help.\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park to stay open, but just essential operations\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park will scale back operations slightly but remain open through Jan. 4 if the federal government shutdown persists, local leaders announced Oct. 31.\n\nThe new funding agreement between local government and groups will allow restrooms, emergency services, campgrounds, Cades Cove, visitor centers and picnic areas to remain open. Local funding kept the national park operational throughout October, one of the busiest seasons for visitors. Starting in November local leaders are scaling back their funding to keep a handful of essential operations going. while letting some other services lapse.\n\nRead more details about how the nation's most-visited national park will continue operating in our full article.\n\nNonprofits in crisis amid increased demand during shutdown\n\nTennessee’s nonprofits are in the midst of “a crisis situation,” said Kevin Dean, president and CEO of the Tennessee Nonprofit Network, an association that connects and strengthens nonprofits across the state. Between precarious government funding and low corporate and individual giving, organizations that give back are struggling.\n\nBut with the government shutdown threatening federal assistance programs, communities are looking to nonprofits to pick up the slack.\n\nIf programs such as SNAP and WIC lose funding Nov. 1, the network anticipates need will “go through the roof,” Dean said. “It’s not a great year to have an increased need, because the there's not increased funding to go along with it,” he added.\n\nThat makes it a key time for those who have the resources to step in and help, whether that’s through financial support or volunteer hours.\n\nDean also emphasized that nonprofits shape a number of spheres and impact community members in ways that often go unnoticed.\n\n“People need to realize that nonprofits are serving them in many ways. I think people don't realize that when they go to a zoo or an art museum, they're supporting a nonprofit, you know, when they go to the YMCA, they're supporting a nonprofit. When they go to a hospital, they're most likely going to a nonprofit hospital,” he said.\n\n“These nonprofits are doing things under the radar but are really keeping civil society together and keeping communities safer and healthier. People often forget that we are really the backbone of the United States, and we're really filling in the gaps for government.”\n\nTennessee launches FeedTN website as end of SNAP funding looms\n\nWith Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits about to end as of Nov. 1, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced the launch of FeedTN.org, a platform intended to help Tennesseans find resources for food assistance and opportunities to donate or volunteer.\n\nAs of Oct. 30, the site linked directly to Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee for Knox County.\n\nWill the government shutdown affect filing federal income taxes?\n\nDespite the ongoing government shutdown, taxpayers must abide by the regular 2026 tax filing deadlines, the Internal Revenue Service announced in October. \"Taxpayers must continue to file and pay taxes as normal,\" an IRS press release said.\n\nLike other federal agencies, the IRS has continued limited operations throughout the shutdown. The IRS is accepting and processing any payments and remittances received electronically or by mail. However, tax refunds will not be paid out during the shutdown, according to the IRS.\n\nAll Tennesseans taxpayers qualified for an extension until Nov. 3 to file their tax returns in 2025 after severe weather, the IRS announced last spring. That deadline stands during the shutdown.\n\nTaxes due during shutdown: Tennesseans face Nov. 3 deadline to file taxes, and support is limited amid the shutdown\n\nIs Great Smoky Mountains National Park taking reservations?\n\nReservations for day use areas in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, including picnic pavilions, Appalachian Clubhouse and Spence Cabin, can be made at recreation.gov during the ongoing federal government shutdown.\n\nBut even though Metcalf Bottoms, Deep Creek and Greenbrier pavilions are year-round facilities, as of Oct. 23 reservations via recreation.gov are only available through Oct. 31, with the next reservations available in May 2026. The official Great Smoky Mountains National Park website states these pavilions can typically be reserved up to a year in advance, though.\n\nThanks to funding from state and local government and partners, the park has continued to operate during the shutdown, but the current agreement with the Department of the Interior is only through Nov. 2. Officials have not said yet if it will be extended past that date.\n\nThe Cosby Pavilion, Appalachian Clubhouse and Spence Cabin are seasonal facilities and will not be available from November through April.\n\nThe Twin Creeks and Collins Creek picnic pavilions remain closed from when the park adjusted to abrupt staffing and organizational shifts back in March because of Trump administration orders and court rulings.\n\nParking tags for Great Smoky Mountains National Park are still available during the government shutdown via recreation.gov. If you purchase online, you must print them out before your visit. Even before the shutdown, park staff did not print parking tags for visitors, according to the park website. Annual passes can be purchased at smokieslife.org.\n\nKnoxville restaurants offer free meals for federal employees\n\nSome local restaurants are offering free food for federal workers during the federal shutdown:\n\nYassin's Falafel House is offering one free meal a day to federal workers when they show their ID for however long the government shutdown lasts. Owner Yassin Terou did the same thing during the 35-day-long 2019 shutdown. Read our full story about why Terou offers this help to his neighbors.\n\nis offering one free meal a day to federal workers when they show their ID for however long the government shutdown lasts. Owner Yassin Terou did the same thing during the 35-day-long 2019 shutdown. Read our full story about why Terou offers this help to his neighbors. Ruby Sunshine, a national chain with a restaurant on Market Square, is offering a complimentary entrée (up to $20) Monday through Friday to furloughed federal workers who show a valid government-issued employee ID, according to a news release.\n\nWill the government shutdown affect SNAP changes implemented by 'Big Beautiful Bill'?\n\nWhen the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" tax and spending act was signed into law in July, it changed requirements for who could receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps.\n\nThe changes focus on what are called “Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents,” people between the ages of 18 and 65 without a disability and without children under 14. Folks in this category – although there are some exclusions – must now spend a minimum of 20 hours per week working, volunteering or participating in a job training program, or they will receive SNAP benefits for just three months out of a three-year period.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent a policy memo to all SNAP state agencies that said the agencies had to immediately apply the changed criteria to applications.\n\nIn Tennessee, those shifts are being implemented. “To maintain SNAP benefits, ABAWD (able-bodied adults without dependents) customers are required to provide work verification at the end of their three-month grace period,” Danielle Cotton, PIO for Tennessee’s Department of Human Services, told Knox News in an email. “Verification deadlines vary for each household and are dependent on individual circumstances.”\n\nEven with much of the federal government closed, the changes made to SNAP are still being enforced in Tennessee. The deadline to provide verification documents regarding exemptions or evidence of work will remain in place.\n\nCongressional staffers aren't furloughed, but aren't getting paid\n\nSome federal employees are furloughed as the government shutdown continues into a third week, but not East Tennessee's congressional staffers.\n\nThe local and Washington, D.C., offices of U.S. Reps. Tim Burchett and Chuck Fleishmann are running as usual, though employees are working without getting paid if the shutdown lasts long enough. The only employees furloughed in either office are interns.\n\nHouse staffers are paid once a month and have not yet missed a paycheck, though that could change if the shutdown runs into November, Burchett chief of staff Jennifer Linginfelter told Knox News.\n\nThe prevailing feeling, Fleishmann's spokesperson Justin Doil said, is staffers will get backpay for any missed payments. Eventually.\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park campsites, LeConte Lodge still taking guests\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park visitors centers will continue to welcome people as usual at least through Nov. 2, thanks to funding from state and local government and other groups. But what about anyone looking to camp at the park or hike to LeConte Lodge to spend the night?\n\nBackcountry reservations and permits for Great Smoky Mountains National Park are still valid, and visitors can still get new backcountry reservations and permits on Smokiespermits.nps.gov or through calling the Backcountry Office, according to the park's website.\n\nLeConte Lodge is continuing to operate normally, a spokesperson from LeConte Lodge told Knox News Oct. 14. The 2025 season for the mountaintop lodge, which is accessible only by hiking, lasts through Nov. 25.\n\nReservations for horse camps, group campgrounds and frontcountry campgrounds still open for the season were listed available on Recreation.gov as of Oct. 13. The site warns, however, that depending on agency operations, reservations might not be able to be completed, and that campers might or might not be notified if a location for which they have a reservation closes.\n\nHow many federal workers live in or around Knoxville?\n\nThe Knoxville metropolitan statistical area is home to over 5,600 federal workers as of August, according to the most recent data available from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Knoxville MSA includes Anderson, Blount, Campbell, Grainger, Knox, Loudon, Morgan, Roane and Union counties.\n\nWIC still providing aid for mothers, babies in Tennessee\n\nAs of Oct. 17, the Tennessee Women, Infants, and Children Program is continuing to operate, Bill Christian, associate director of the Tennessee Department of Health's Office of Communication and Media Relations, told Knox News.\n\n\"Staff continue monitoring the federal situation and will notify participants and vendors in advance of any change to WIC operations in Tennessee,\" he said earlier in October.\n\nGeorgia Machell, president and CEO of the National WIC Association, said in a Sept. 30 statement WIC had enough funding to stay open for an estimated one to two weeks during the shutdown.\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − or WIC − provides free supplemental groceries, breastfeeding support and nutrition education for pregnant or recently pregnant women, breastfeeding women, infants and children younger than 5 and caregivers of children younger than 5 who fall under a certain household income level.\n\nShutdown means no flyover before Vols' home game against Arkansas\n\nTennessee football won't have a military flyover before its game against Arkansas at Neyland Stadium on Oct. 11 because of the government shutdown, a UT spokesperson told Knox News on Oct. 9. This will mark the first University of Tennessee home game this season without a flyover at the end of the national anthem.\n\nBus tours of Manhattan Project sites suspended\n\nThe Department of Energy has halted bus tours of Manhattan Project sites in Oak Ridge because of the federal shutdown.\n\nThe tours, which cost $15 per person and run for three hours, are postponed \"until further notice,\" according to information posted on the American Museum of Science and Energy’s website. People who purchased tickets on tours coinciding with the shutdown can contact jtackett@amse.org for refunds, according to the website statement.\n\nHow long before shutdown could disrupt public housing?\n\nEviction prevention advocates haven't heard of any disruptions to Section 8, housing choice vouchers or public housing due to the shutdown so far.\n\nThat could change, however, if the shutdown continues \"for a very long time,\" Michael Davis, the Eviction Prevention Program managing attorney for Legal Aid of East Tennessee, told Knox News in an email.\n\n\"If it goes longer than a month, we’ll likely start seeing substantial uncertainty and disruption to a lot of things,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development will continue paying its portion of HUD-assisted housing through November 2025, according to the National Housing Law Project. Davis said KCDC, Knoxville's public housing authority, might have reserves to prolong its payments past November. A representative from KCDC did not respond to Knox News' request for comment.\n\nKCDC manages and rents more than 3,700 units across more than 20 properties and manages the application process and distribution of 4,000 Section 8 vouchers, according to its website.\n\nMcGhee Tyson Airport flights staying on schedule\n\nDespite air traffic control staffing issues at some airports around the country at times, Knoxville's airport has been mostly travel business as usual.\n\nStaffing issues prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to reduce flights in and out of Nashville International Airport starting at 2:30 p.m. Oct. 7, The Tennessean reported. Flights at McGhee Tyson Airport, however, remained mostly on time as of 4:30 p.m. that day.\n\nSevier County tourism leaders ‘grateful’ for short-term Smokies fix\n\nPigeon Forge tourism department director Leon Downey is “grateful” that local and state leaders have implemented a plan to keep Great Smoky Mountains National Park fully open.\n\nWith nearly two million people visiting, October is one of the most critical months for businesses surrounding the park.\n\n“October is a beautiful month in the Smoky Mountains, and visitor access to the national park is significant to our tourism industry but also a joy for those who come to this area to experience our fall colors,” Downey told Knox News Oct. 6.\n\nSevier County ranks third in visitor spending among all 95 Tennessee counties, according to Tourism Economics. Last year, the national park generated $2.04 billion in visitor spending and $2.86 billion in total economic output.\n\nDowney added he’s “cautiously optimistic” the federal government shutdown will end sooner rather than later. But if not, he welcomes any extension of the short-term fix local and state leader have in place.\n\nGatlinburg reported experiencing minimal impact from the earliest days of the shutdown.\n\nChad Netherland of the Gatlinburg Convention and Visitors Bureau told Knox News Oct. 2 that stores and shops in the popular downtown areas were full and that hotels had no cancellations because of the shutdown.\n\nCounty would be reimbursed for inmates, while city is largely unaffected\n\nAs the federal government shutdown enters its second week, local governments that rely on federal dollars to fund programs and/or reimburse them for expenses are largely left waiting on funds. But that isn’t a problem − not yet, anyway.\n\nMoney collected by Knox County from the federal government is typically collected in arrears, meaning the county is reimbursed at a later date. This will be the case for the $354,312 in reimbursements the county is owed for housing inmates at the Roger D. Wilson Detention Facility in September.\n\nThe Knox County Sheriff’s Office billed the U.S. Marshals for $158,916 for housing federal inmates and billed the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement another $195,396 for holding immigration detainees, according to spokesperson Kimberly Glenn.\n\nOverall, the county budgets plenty in federal grants, roughly $178 million - $121 million of that for Knox County Schools – in fiscal year 2024. Those funds aren’t threatened as of now.\n\n“While reimbursement for grants is typically department-based, most departments have websites that automate this process,” Knox County Finance Director Chris Caldwell said in an email to Knox News. “We've been notified by some departments that the shutdown will not impact us on grant reimbursements. Additionally, we typically make quarterly grant reimbursements, so we will initiate that process later this month.”\n\nSimilarly, the city of Knoxville is not concerned about missing or delayed funds, spokesperson Kristin Farley said.\n\n\"While we are watching developments closely and are concerned about nonprofits who rely on federal dollars, the city is not overly dependent on federal funds,\" she said in an email to Knox News. \"Our last audit showed that federal dollars made up about 2% of our net budget (roughly $11.7 million). At this time, no payments have been delayed to the city – that we are aware of.\"\n\nOak Ridge Reservation, including national lab, operating as usual\n\nMajor parts of the federal and contract-based workforce at the Oak Ridge Reservation − which includes the Oak Ridge National Laboratory − are operating under normal conditions amid the shutdown.\n\n“DOE’s Office of Science laboratories are not currently experiencing a lapse in funding and continue to operate in a normal capacity, with staff reporting to work and carrying out their mission,” a Department of Energy spokesperson said in an unsigned statement via email.\n\nThe statement came as a response to Knox News’ questions concerning work and staffing at the lab, Y-12 and the Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management during the shutdown.\n\nLeaders at United Cleanup Oak Ridge − a contractor that, along with OREM, handles legacy waste cleanup across the Oak Ridge Reservation − also expect to keep operating normally, at least into November.\n\nUniversity of Tennessee not feeling shutdown impacts yet\n\nThe University of Tennessee at Knoxville is holding onto hope that Congress will reconcile and reopen the federal government soon. The Knoxville campus, along with others in the UT System, will operate normally in the meantime, UT System spokeswoman Melissa Tindell said.\n\nUT campuses might be affected if the government shutdown goes on for a long time. The university recommended faculty members reach out to program managers and federal contacts before the shutdown with any questions about research or federally funded programs.\n\nMany of UT’s research projects receive federal funding from agencies such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe University of Tennessee System lost $38.69 million for 45 grants terminated in May as ordered by President Donald Trump. Some of those grants have come back, Chancellor Donde Plowman told Knox News.\n\nBack in January 2019, the UT Institute of Agriculture sent out a newsletter about the previous shutdown, directing anyone working on projects that required federal funding to stop their work until resources were made available again.\n\n\"If the work does not involve accessing federal agency locations, resources, data, personnel, or additional funding, the work can continue as long as you have available award funding,\" the 2019 newsletter said. \"However, it is advised to be prudent in your expenditures and only incur expenses necessary for performance of current needs.\"\n\nDuring the current shutdown, students receiving financial aid or filing their Free Application for Federal Student Aid shouldn’t have problems, as the U.S. Department of Education is continuing to operate key areas including distributing financial aid and processing FAFSA applications with a skeleton crew during the shutdown.\n\n\"Regarding FAFSA and student loans, students are encouraged to continue submitting the FAFSA form and utilizing available site functions,” Tindell told Knox News via email. “Federal student loan payments should also proceed as scheduled.\"\n\nKnox County Schools prepared to cover costs for now\n\nKnox County Schools shouldn’t experience any problems with the government shutdown unless it lasts for a long time, according to Superintendent Jon Rysewyk. The district can use its own budget to pay for programs that use federal funding, like Title I and food services, and then file for reimbursement once the government reopens.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is operating with a small percentage of workers to continue work within the federal student loans and funding departments, according to a contingency plan. This includes making funding available for Title I and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act programs.\n\n“I think we're going to see a lot more impacts across many fields than just education,\" Rysewyk said about the possibility of a prolonged shutdown. \"But I think we're in pretty good shape to weather this one for a little while.”\n\nKnox News reporters Hayden Dunbar, Allie Feinberg, Mariah Franklin, Keenan Thomas, Devarrick Turner.

For the latest news on the LA protests, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Tuesday, June 10.\n\nLOS ANGELES − A tense standoff between California and the federal government escalated Monday, with federal officials preparing to send in 700 Marines to assist the National Guard and state officials saying they will sue the Trump administration's decision to \"trample over\" Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority.\n\nNewsom shot back at Trump over the move to send in Marines: \"U.S. Marines have served honorably across multiple wars in defense of democracy. They are heroes. They shouldn't be deployed on American soil facing their own countrymen to fulfill the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial President.\"\n\nThe addition of active-duty troops marks a significant escalation. It comes as California officials say they will sue the Trump administration, challenging the decision to federalize the National Guard and send its members onto city streets amid increasingly hostile protests over Trump's immigration policies, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday.\n\nIn addition to the Marines, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell announced on Monday that 2,000 National Guardsmen would be deployed to Los Angeles. The mobilization of additional troops comes after Trump authorized 2,000 guardsmen to be deployed to the city.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the Marines are being sent \"due to increased threats to federal law enforcement officers and federal buildings, approximately 700 active-duty... are being deployed to Los Angeles to restore order.\"\n\n\"We have an obligation to defend federal law enforcement officers - even if Gavin Newsom will not,\" Hegseth said.\n\nTrump said the troop deployment in Los Angeles is expected to last 60 days, according to California’s adjutant general.\n\nCalifornia governor says 'Trump wants chaos'\n\nAmid moves from the Trump administration to deploy as many as 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is firing back with all tools in his arsenal, including 800 additional officers, a lawsuit and invectives warning Trump is acting like a “dictator.”\n\n“Los Angeles: don’t take Trump’s bait. Trump wants chaos and he’s instigated violence,” Newsom said in a post on X. “Stay peaceful. Stay focused. Don’t give him the excuse he’s looking for.”\n\nNewsom’s move to rally support comes after Trump ordered National Guardsmen to Los Angeles without the governor’s consent and after the president even suggested Newsom should be arrested.\n\n“This isn’t about public safety. It’s about stroking a dangerous President’s ego,” Newsom said in another post. “This is Reckless. Pointless. And Disrespectful to our troops.\"\n\nThe California governor has called out Trump’s moves to intervene in the city while also drawing a firm line with protestors: “Foolish agitators who take advantage of Trump’s chaos will be held accountable.”\n\nTrump and Newsom have often clashed, but the showdown over Los Angeles marks a new low in their heated relationship. In a lawsuit, Newsom says the Trump administration is violating California’s sovereignty.\n\n“One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit says. Trump “used a protest that local authorities had under control to make another unprecedented power grab, this time at the cost of the sovereignty of the State of California.”\n\nRead more about their feud here.\n\nMarines heading to Los Angeles\n\nA photojournalist for the Desert Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, spotted a convoy of Marines heading for Los Angeles Monday evening.\n\nFive buses and six to 10 armed vehicles passed Park Boulevard near Joshua Tree while heading west on Highway 62 — the main route from Twentynine Palms to Los Angeles — shortly after 7 p.m. At the nearby crosswalk, about 20 protestors were gathered demonstrating against the recent immigrations raids.\n\nThe movement of troops to the city comes just hours after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced 700 Marines would be \"deployed to Los Angeles to restore order.\"\n\nCalifornia state officials have fired back that federal troops are escalating the tension between law enforcement and protestors.\n\nProtests into the night\n\nSeveral crowds of demonstrators circled downtown Los Angeles, including City Hall and several federal buildings as helicopters paced the crowds from above. By 7 p.m. local time, the crowds numbered at least several hundred, snaking its way past cars and graffiti calling for ICE to be abolished.Car horns and sirens maintained a constant background symphony as protesters walked. Police officers periodically fired tear gas or pepper balls as a crowd sometimes moved too close to a protected building or someone threw a water bottle at them.Unlike the previous evening, local authorities appeared to have the area under firm control, although no one stopped people with spray paint from defacing public buildings.There was no visible sign of federal troops.\n\nLawsuit filed, alleges 'unnecessary, unlawful' actions by Trump\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Bonta announced details of the lawsuit against the administration, calling Trump's move \"unnecessary, counterproductive and most importantly unlawful.\" Bonta said Trump's order abused the federal government's authority and \"trampled over\" Gov. Gavin Newsom's sovereignty.\n\nTrump said the guard would restore order amid mounting violent clashes between police and protesters angry at his aggressive pursuit of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. illegally. On Monday, U.S. Northern Command confirmed 700 Marines would also be sent into the city.\n\nThe president pledged in a social media post to \"liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots. Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Newsom blamed Trump for the increase in unrest after three days of protests, saying \"we’re suing him.\"\n\n“Donald Trump is creating fear and terror by failing to adhere to the U.S. Constitution and overstepping his authority. This is a manufactured crisis to allow him to take over a state militia, damaging the very foundation of our republic,” Newsom said in a statement.\n\nPolice on Monday were urging businesses and residents to report any \"vandalism, damage or looting\" for documentation after some of the protests Sunday deteriorated into destructive clashes between officers and protesters. Some vehicles were set ablaze, protesters blocked the 101 Freeway, and a group of them converged on an overpass and threw objects down at police, video footage showed.\n\nAuthorities declared several of the demonstrations Sunday \"unlawful assemblies,\" sweeping in with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades to disperse hundreds of protesters. Police in riot gear were joined by hundreds of the California National Guard troops.\n\nNewsom calls in 800 police officers\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Monday that he would have an additional 800 state and local law enforcement officers deploy to Los Angeles.\n\nNewsom said the additional officers are being called in order to handle the protests stemming from the face-offs between protestors and national guardsmen that were sent in “illegally,” according to the governor’s office.\n\n“Chaos is exactly what Trump wanted, now we are sending in hundreds more law enforcement to pick up the pieces,” Newsom said. “State and local leaders stand together, coordinated and resolute to ensure the safety of the Los Angeles region.”\n\nKaren Bass, LA’s mayor, backed Newsom: “While Washington choreographed these chaotic events, the LAPD and local law enforcement continue to effectively respond.”\n\n700 Marines sent to LA\n\nThe Pentagon is sending 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration sweeps by the Trump administration, according to U.S. Northern Command spokesperson Col Kelly Frushour.\n\nFrushour said the troops belong to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment and are based at Twentynine Palms, about 140 miles east of Los Angeles. The California-based Marines will join the 2,100 federalized National Guard troops \"protecting federal personnel and federal property in the greater Los Angeles area,\" Frushour added.\n\nMarines heading to Los Angeles are from an infantry battalion whose typical mission is close combat with enemy forces. But for this mission, Frushour said, the activated Marines and Guardsmen \"have been trained in de-escalation, crowd control, and standing rules for the use of force.\"\n\nThe Marines will be moving out within hours, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Marines had been on standby since Saturday, according to U.S. Northern Command, which is in charge of the operation that also includes California National Guardsmen. Like the Guard troops, the Marines will be used to protect federal property.\n\nThe addition of active-duty troops is a significant escalation in the administration’s ongoing efforts to round up those who have violated immigration laws. There are thousands of active-duty troops assisting at the southern border but none inside a major U.S. city.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook, Davis Winkie\n\nGov. Newsom files lawsuit against Trump over California ‘sovereignty’\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit on Monday against President Donald Trump over the president’s move to deploy members of the California National Guard without Newsom’s consent. The process is called federalizing the National Guard.\n\nThe Office of the California Attorney General shared a copy of the lawsuit with USA TODAY late Monday afternoon local time.\n\n“One of the cornerstones of our Nation and our democracy is that our people are governed by civil, not military, rule,” the lawsuit says. Trump “used a protest that local authorities had under control to make another unprecedented power grab, this time at the cost of the sovereignty of the State of California.”\n\nTrump authorized 2,000 National Guardsmen on June 7 to deploy to Los Angeles and on June 9 Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered another 2,000 to the city, according to the lawsuit.\n\n50 arrests, 600 non-lethal bullets fired: LAPD\n\nOfficials at the Los Angeles Police Department announced that they had arrested 50 people over Saturday and Sunday in downtown areas that “escalated into significant acts of violence, vandalism, and looting.”\n\nLAPD said 29 people were arrested Saturday evening for failing to follow orders to disperse. 21 people were arrested Sunday on charges from attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail to assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, LAPD said.\n\nAuthorities said officers used tear gas on the “hostile crowd” as well as over 600 rounds of non-lethal bullets. Among those hit was an Australian journalist covering the protests.\n\nAt least five officers received minor injuries, according to LAPD. Five police horses also “were targeted and sustained minor injuries.”\n\nPolice said protest groups used handheld radios “to coordinate and evade law enforcement.”\n\nLAPD said its Professional Standards Bureau will investigate excessive use of force allegations.\n\nWatch officer fires non-lethal bullet at journalist\n\nAn Australian journalist was shot with a rubber bullet by an officer while covering protests in Los Angeles over the weekend, according to her media outlet.\n\nLauren Tomasi, a U.S. national correspondent for Australia's 9News, was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet while reporting on the immigration raids and ensuing protests in Los Angeles on Sunday, June 8, the network reported.\n\nVideo captured by 9News shows a nearby armed police officer aiming a weapon at Tomasi before firing, striking the back of her left leg. Tomasi is heard yelling out in pain as the camera pans away.\n\nTomasi is sore but otherwise unharmed from the incident, 9News reported.\n\n- Greta Cross\n\nWhy burning EVs like Waymos isn't a good idea\n\nMultiple Waymo self-driving robotaxis were set on fire in Los Angeles during the protests. Other cars were also put to the torch but the Waymos have garnered special interest, partially because they're something new on the scene and partially because as electric vehicles, they raise different and specific concerns if their batteries burn.\n\nElectric vehicle fires can burn hotter and more intensely than gasoline-fueled cars, if their batteries catch fire.\n\nThe fires also release different emissions than traditional gasoline-powered vehicle fires, including gases such as hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and metal-based particulates.\n\nEV fires are also more difficult to put out than ones in gasoline-powered cars and require different firefighting techniques, which firefighters are trained on.\n\n- Elizabeth Weise\n\nGlendale scraps deal with ICE\n\nThe City of Glendale, about 9 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, announced it would be terminating its contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold federal immigration detainees at the local police facility, city officials said in a news release Sunday night. ICE’s agreement with Glendale had been in place since 2007, according to the release.\n\n“(The) City recognizes that public perception of the ICE contract—no matter how limited or carefully managed, no matter the good—has become divisive,” the statement said.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Homeland Security responded to the announcement on X, saying ”Glendale’s politicians stand with criminal illegal aliens, including gang members, rapists, and murderers over American citizens.”\n\n“It is deeply disturbing that sanctuary politicians in Glendale, California, would terminate an agreement to hold ICE detainees and violent criminals — which the city has had with DHS for more than 15 years — just as violent rioters are looting and defacing Los Angeles and assaulting federal law enforcement,” DHS said.\n\n- Victoria Valenzuela\n\nCelebs speak out on LA protests\n\nSeveral stars have taken to social media to share information and resources, and to criticize the federal response to what they called peaceful demonstrations in Los Angeles.\n\nOn June 8, Billie Eilish's brother and collaborator, Finneas, posted on his Instagram story about the protests, cursing at ICE and sharing that he attended a protest and was immediately met with force.\n\n\"Tear gassed almost immediately at the very peaceful protest downtown ‒ they're inciting this,\" wrote the songwriter, an LA native.\n\n-Taijuan Moorman\n\nCalifornia to sue Trump administration over National Guard deployment\n\nBonta, the California attorney general, confirmed June 9 that the state plans to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its \"unlawful\" decision to deploy National Guard troops in Los Angeles against Newsom's wishes.\n\nBonta said that by the time the first few hundred troops arrived in Los Angles \"the protests had mostly dissipated and streets were mostly quiet and calm.\" After the troops were deployed, Bonta said the situation escalated and unrest grew, \"causing highways to close and putting people in danger.\"\n\nThe order violated the 10th Amendment and failed to meet the criteria required to invoke the law, according to the attorney general. Bonta said the move marks the first time a president has invoked this statute since President Richard Nixon ordered the National Guard to deliver mail during the 1970 Postal Service Strike.\n\n\"They unlawfully invoked a law that's intended to prevent an invasion by a foreign nation or a rebellion or local and state law enforcement make it so that the laws of the United States cannot be executed,\" Bonta said. \"Those are the only three triggers that would provide for the invocation of the National Guard, and none of them were present here.\"\n\nWhen asked about Trump's suggestion that Newsom should be arrested, Bonta defended the governor's actions and downplayed the possibility.\n\n\"It is the president and the Trump administration that is consistently and frequently, blatantly and brazenly violating the law, not Governor Newsom,\" Bonta said. \"So it's a seems to be more of bluster and threat.\"\n\nSan Francisco joins in protests\n\nIn San Francisco, three separate protests against immigration arrests were scheduled for Monday, June 9.\n\nThe first took place at noon at the California State Building, a few blocks from City Hall. It was called by the Service Employees International Union, whose California president, David Huerta, was arrested Friday in the Los Angeles protests. Attendees were urged to wear their union colors.\n\nA second protest was scheduled to be held at San Francisco City Hall at 4 p.m. local time and was organized by multiple local progressive groups.\n\nFinally, at 6 p.m. a protest was scheduled to be held at the 24th street BART subway plaza in San Francisco’s Mission District, which is the heart of the city’s Hispanic community.\n\nThe protests in San Francisco come as several Waymo self-driving taxis were attacked and burned in Los Angeles during protests on Saturday, June 7. The city in Northern California is home to the largest number of the self-driving cars, where they are a common sight on roadways.\n\nWaymo told USA TODAY while the company was still operating and serving riders in San Francisco, out of an abundance of caution it was limiting trips in certain areas where protesters may be gathering.\n\n- Elizabeth Weise\n\nLA day laborers don't fear ICE raids\n\nWhile national attention focused on Los Angeles, it was business as usual for virtually everyone in the city.\n\nOutside the Home Depot in the Paramount neighborhood, a small group of day laborers in paint-stained pants sat on buckets waiting for work. Several said ICE had detained people across Alondra Boulevard on June 7, sparking unrest.\n\nThey said that although they lacked papers to remain legally in the United States, they weren’t worried about being deported if ICE agents returned. Mexican-born Jose Luis Valencia, 54, said if it’s his time to go back to his home country, he’ll go.\n\n“We’re not thieves,” he said. “We’re just looking for jobs.”\n\nLA resident says city is still 'very peaceful' amid protests\n\nLongtime LA resident Ira Long, 67, said the reporting of the unrest has been overblown. Long, a pastor at the Alondra Church of Christ in Compton, said he still remembers when the National Guard was called out in the wake of the 1992 Rodney King riots.\n\n“That was a really, really terrible time. Right now I don’t feel any of that tension or anxiety,” said Long, a retired special education teacher. “But people are uneasy, and there’s a real sense of loss because we have lost people who were a part of this community.”\n\nSpeaking as church volunteers prepared to distribute food to community members about a half mile from where weekend protests erupted, Long said he wants the rest of the country to know Los Angeles is a good, safe city.\n\n“This is a very loving community,” he said. “It’s never been totally out of control. It has its challenges, its issues. But there are also amazing and fantastic families who make this a great place to live. It’s very peaceful. And right now it’s pretty cool.”\n\nImmigration enforcement protesters rally outside Justice Department\n\nDozens of protesters rallied outside the Justice Department’s headquarters in Washington to criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the National Guard.\n\n“Enough of these mass ICE raids who are sweeping up innocent people,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said June 9. “Enough of the undermining of due process.”\n\nThe Service Employees International Union organized the protest after the union’s California president, David Huerta, was arrested in the Los Angeles protests. Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told KNBC, Huerta allegedly obstructed law enforcement vehicles from getting into a facility where they were conducting a search warrant, citing video of the arrest.\n\n“They tried to move him and then he got into a physical altercation with one of our agents and he resisted and he had to be pepper sprayed and subdued,” Essayli said.\n\nParticipants at the Justice Department protest held signs that said, “Free David. End ICE Raids” and “Justice for David Huerta Now.”\n\nThe rally was one of more than a dozen scheduled in cities across the U.S. to demand Huerta’s release and an end to workplace immigration raids, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\n'I would': Trump says he'd arrest Newsom\n\nAmid the mounting legal clash between the federal government and the state of California, Trump suggested that his border czar Tom Homan should arrest Newsom.\n\n“I would do it … I think it’s great,” Trump said when asked if Homan should arrest the governor, who has challenged the administration’s mobilization of National Guard troops to crack down on violent protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\nArresting Newsom, who responded to Homan’s threat by daring the feds to arrest him in a June 8 social media post, would represent a major escalation of the state’s widening rift with the Trump administration.\n\n− Davis Winkie\n\nNewsom warns that Trump could try federalizing Guard 'in any state'\n\nLAPD Chief Jim McDonnell called the outbreak of violence \"disgusting\" and said it had grown worse Saturday. He said he does not believe the same people who were genuinely protesting immigration policy were involved in the violence.\n\nNewsom warned that violent protesters would be arrested and prosecuted. He also kept up his social media attack on Trump, saying California \"didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved\" and that unrest is \"exactly\" what Trump wanted.\n\n\"Let’s get this straight: 1) Local law enforcement didn’t need help. 2) Trump sent troops anyway — to manufacture chaos and violence. 3) Trump succeeded,\" Newsom wrote. \"4) Now things are destabilized and we need to send in more law enforcement just to clean up Trump’s mess.\"\n\nFamilies of detainees plead for release of loved ones\n\nFamily members of several people detained last week in an ICE sweep pleaded for the release of their loved ones at a press conference Monday. Elaina Jung Hee Vermeulen, with the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, said she attempted on Sunday to meet with some of the detained warehouse workers.\n\n\"Instead of allowing me to meet with community members, they jumped onto trucks in riot gear,\" she said. Vermeulen urged local leaders to protect the rights of working class immigrants and said ICE must be banned from entering workplaces.\n\n\"Every single person who is here, who is figintg for a better life for their family, deserves to have their rights protected,\" she said.\n\nNoem explains reversal on federalizing National Guard\n\nAs South Dakota governor in February 2024, Kristi Noem threatened then-President Joe Biden when Democrats said he should federalize the National Guard in Texas to disrupt that state governor's anti-immigration efforts.\n\nIf he did, Noem warned, Biden would be mounting a “direct attack on states’ rights,” and sparking a “war” between Washington and Republican-led state governments, she said in a Feb. 6, 2024 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\nOn June 8, Noem − now Trump's Homeland Security secretary − cheered Trump for doing the same thing to the Democratic governor of the state of California.\n\nOn CBS News' Face the Nation Sunday, Noem explained her reversal by saying, \"Governor Newsom has proven that he makes bad decisions.\" Read more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer\n\n‘Trump didn’t start’ riots: California sheriff rips Harris’ comments\n\nA California sheriff running for governor isn’t pleased with former Vice President Kamala Harris’ reaction to the explosive protests. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said in a June 8 post on X that Trump is \"not out there lighting cars on fire, hurling projectiles at law enforcement or blocking freeways.”\n\nThe sheriff, whose county is just north of San Diego and the fourth-most populous county in the state, was responding to Harris’ earlier statement where she said the deployment of the National Guard was \"meant to provoke chaos.”\n\nHarris, who is mulling a bid for California governor next year, put much of the blame on the Trump administration’s ICE raids and a \"cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\"\n\nBianco, who is also running for governor in 2026, is a long-standing Trump supporter who gained a bit of attention in 2021 for vowing not to enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates in his office.\n\nHe said Sunday the former VP’s comments were “an embarrassment.\"\n\n“The Democrats and their ‘leaders’ own this,” Bianco added.\n\n− Phillip M. Bailey\n\nLatinas for Trump co-founder blasts Trump immigration policy\n\nFlorida state Sen. Ileana Garcia, who co-founded the group Latinas for Trump, criticized his administration's recent immigration enforcement actions as “unacceptable and inhumane” in a post on X.\n\nHer remarks come as federal agents have arrested immigrants in courthouses across the U.S., including Florida, stripping them of due process protections, as NBC News reported.\n\n“I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings − in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims − all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,” she wrote in her post, referring to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\n\nShe said she stands with Florida Republican Rep. María Elvira Salazar, who wrote in a statement June 6 that “anyone with a pending asylum case, status-adjustment petition, or similar claim deserves to go through the legal process.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBorder czar denies threatening to arrest Newsom\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan on Monday denied ever calling for the arrest of Newsom. Homan told Fox News that he was asked if Newsom or Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass could be arrested and Homan responded that, if they commit a crime, they could be arrested.\n\n“There was no discussion about arresting Newsom,” Homan said.\n\nNewsom had addressed the issue on social media, saying that \"Trump’s border czar is threatening to arrest me for speaking out. Come and get me, tough guy. I don't give a damn. It won’t stop me from standing up for California.\"\n\nProtesters flee tear gas grenades\n\nAt 8 p.m. local time on Sunday, authorities declared the protest to be an unlawful assembly and moved in aggressively with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades.\n\nThat sent hundreds of people running, their eyes streaming with tears. Helicopters clattered overhead as protesters fled the area to the honking of car horns and periodic cheers.\n\nAccording to preliminary information, police said at least 10 people have been arrested and three officers were injured during protests on Sunday. California Highway Patrol arrested 17 people on the 101 Freeway, police said. On Saturday, police arrested 29 people.\n\nRecent ICE sweeps sparked protests in Los Angeles\n\nThe protests began Friday after Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps in the area resulted in more than 40 arrests. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the raids and said those arrested by ICE included a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\n\"These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets,\" McLaughlin said in a statement. \"Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer.\"\n\n60 arrested after San Francisco protest\n\nProtests against immigration enforcement policies were not limited to the Los Angeles area. In San Francisco, a demonstration that drew hundreds ended with violence and about 60 arrests, police said.\n\n\"Individuals in the group became violent and began to commit crimes ranging from assault to felony vandalism and causing property damage,\" San Francisco police said in a statement. An unlawful assembly was declared and many left the scene while others vandalized buildings and police cars. Two officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\n\n\"Individuals are always free to exercise their First Amendment rights in San Francisco but violence especially against SFPD officers - will never be tolerated,\" the statement said.\n\nVideos show Waymo cars on fire amid LA protests; service reportedly suspended\n\nLos Angeles protesters set fire to Waymo self-driving cars\n\nPhotos and videos show several Waymo self-driving cars being torched during the protests. The LAPD said one street had been closed indefinitely after \"multiple autonomous vehicles\" had been set on fire.\n\nFootage shared on social media captured several of Waymo driverless taxis engulfed in flames in the June 8 protests. Others were vandalized with messages against Trump and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, videos show.\n\nWaymo suspended service in downtown Los Angeles and \"will not be serving any rides in the protest area until it is deemed safe,\" a company spokesperson told NBC News.\n\n− Melina Khan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/china/china-covid-lockdown-protests-2022-intl-hnk-dst", "title": "China Covid protests: How a deadly fire ignited a week of dissent ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nStunning scenes of dissent and defiance played out across China over the past week, marking the country’s largest protests in decades – and an unprecedented challenge to leader Xi Jinping.\n\nDeep public anger after nearly three years of snap lockdowns, border closures and financial hardship brought thousands out onto the streets to demand an end to mainland China’s zero-Covid policy – with some also calling for democracy.\n\nThe country’s security forces moved swiftly to snuff out the protests, while health officials tried to appease the public by promising to soften tough Covid measures. But furious posts on Chinese social media, which continued despite censors’ best efforts, suggested it wasn’t enough.\n\nThen came Friday, and the first known remarks from Xi on the protests – an unexpected acknowledgment of people’s frustration, according to a European Union official who declined to be named.\n\n“Xi also said Omicron is less deadly than Delta, which makes the Chinese government feel more open to further relaxing Covid restrictions,” the EU official added, raising hopes of greater freedoms after an extraordinary week.\n\nThe deadly fire\n\nOn November 24, Ali Abbas’ granddaughter was charging her tablet device when an electrical fault caused smoke to fill their Urumqi home, in China’s far western Xinjiang region, he told CNN on the phone from Turkey.\n\nSmoke quickly turned to flames, which raced through the wood-furnished apartment. Abbas’ granddaughter and daughter were able to evacuate – but residents on higher floors found themselves stranded after the elevator stopped working.\n\nSome households with previous Covid cases were also locked inside their apartments, leaving them with no way to escape. Urumqi has been under strict lockdown since August, with most residents banned from leaving their homes.\n\nThe fire broke out in Urumqi, Xinjiang, on November 24, according to Chinese authorities. Credit: Douyin\n\nVideos of the incident, taken from other buildings and on the street, suggest firefighters may have been delayed in reaching victims due to street-level lockdown restrictions. Footage shows one fire truck struggling to spray water at the building from a distance.\n\nState-run media reported the fire killed 10 people and injured nine, but reports from local residents suggest the real toll is far higher. A day after the blaze, Urumqi local government officials denied the city’s Covid policies were to blame for the deaths, adding that an investigation was underway.\n\nWhat happened to my neighbors is really a big disaster. I would like to express my sincere sorrow to all Uyghur people, to all those loved ones who lost their family members. Ali Abbas, apartment owner\n\nPublic anger quickly swelled. Videos online showed people marching to a government building in Urumqi on the night of November 25, demanding an end to the lockdown, chanting with fists in the air. Residents in other parts of the city broke through lockdown barriers and confronted Covid workers dressed in PPE; at one point, the crowd sang the national anthem, roaring the chorus: “Arise, arise, arise!”\n\nThe scenes were extraordinary in a city subject to some of China’s most stringent surveillance and security. The government has long been accused of committing human rights abuses against ethnic Uyghurs and other minorities in the region, including placing up to 2 million people in internment camps. Beijing has repeatedly denied these accusations, claiming the camps are vocational training centers.\n\nThe next morning, the Urumqi government said it would gradually ease the lockdown in certain areas. But by then, it was too late to quell the protests erupting across the nation.\n\nMounting frustrations\n\nThe protests tapped into a well of anger that had been brewing over China’s zero-Covid policy – and the damage it has often caused – as the rest of the world ended lockdown restrictions and eased other mandates, including masking.\n\nThe cost has been immense. Unemployment has skyrocketed. The economy is flailing. Those trapped in unexpected lockdowns have found themselves without adequate food, basic supplies, or even medical care in non-Covid emergencies.\n\nAnd, like those in the Urumqi fire, many deaths have been blamed on the zero-Covid policy in the last six months – far more than the six official Covid deaths reported during the same period. Demands for accountability are growing, especially after a September bus crash that killed 27 people while transporting residents to a Covid quarantine facility, and the November death of a toddler during a suspected gas leak in a locked-down residential compound.\n\nFrom left, a protest banner is seen on Sitong Bridge in Beijing on October 13, and Foxconn employees in Zhengzhou take buses home on October 30. Twitter/Getty Images\n\nThe policy had been broadly popular at the start of the pandemic, but many residents have now had enough. In a rare demonstration in October, a sole protester hung banners on a Beijing bridge that decried Covid restrictions and demanded Xi’s removal.\n\nThough all references to the banners were wiped from the Chinese internet, versions of those slogans began appearing in other parts of the country and in universities around the world – scrawled on bathroom walls and pinned on bulletin boards. More acts of disobedience came in November; workers fled China’s largest iPhone assembly factory in Zhengzhou when it was placed under lockdown, while residents of Guangzhou, also a manufacturing hub, tore down lockdown barriers and surged onto the streets in a nighttime revolt.\n\nFrom June to November 22, American think tank Freedom House recorded at least 79 protests against Covid restrictions, spanning from social media campaigns to gatherings on the street. But most of these voiced grievances against local authorities – a far cry from some of the nationwide protests that, for the first time in a generation, took aim at the country’s powerful leader and central government.\n\nAn unprecedented wave of protest\n\nProtesters gather in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai on November 26. Credit: Twitter/@whyyoutouzhele\n\nThe protests in Urumqi quickly sparked more across the country – from the original epicenter of the pandemic in Wuhan, to the capital Beijing, and Shanghai, China’s glitzy financial hub, which still carries the trauma of its own two-month lockdown earlier this year.\n\nHundreds of Shanghai residents gathered on November 26 for a candlelight vigil for the victims of the fire. Grief turned to anger as the crowd chanted slogans calling for freedom and political reform, while holding blank sheets of paper in a symbolic protest against censorship. In videos, people can be heard shouting for Xi and the Communist Party to “step down,” and singing a famous socialist anthem.\n\nAround 300 kilometers (186 miles) away, dozens of students in Nanjing gathered to mourn the victims, with photos showing a crowd of young people lit by cell phone flashlights. Images of the protests raced across social media faster than censors could erase them – igniting demonstrations in other university campuses, including the prestigious Peking University in Beijing. One wall at Peking University bore a message in red paint, echoing the slogans used by the protester who had hung the Beijing bridge banners in October: “Say no to lockdown, yes to freedom.”\n\nProtesters and students demonstrate outside Nanjing University, November 26. Credit: Twitter/@whyyoutouzhele\n\nSome of these protests dispersed peacefully, while several escalated into scuffles with police. In Shanghai, one protester told CNN around 80 to 110 people had been detained by police on the night of November 26, adding they were released 24 hours later after officers collected their fingerprints and retina patterns.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify the number of protesters detained and it is unclear how many people, if any, remain in custody.\n\nBeijing emerged as a protest hotspot on November 27, as hundreds of students gathered at the elite Tsinghua University, shouting: “Democracy and rule of law! Freedom of expression!” Elsewhere in the city, a large crowd gathered for a vigil and a march through the commercial center, chanting slogans for greater civil liberties.\n\nAmid the mourning and frustration, a strong sense of solidarity emerged as people shared the rare chance to stand side by side and voice grievances long silenced.\n\nIt turns out there are so many people who are wide awake Protester in Chengdu\n\nOnline, China’s vast army of censors worked overtime to erase content about the demonstrations – prompting many to get creative. Some posts on social media consisted only of one or two characters repeated for several paragraphs, in the long tradition of using codes and wordless icons to convey dissent on China’s internet.\n\nSimilar tactics were used on the ground, with videos on social media showing crowds shouting, “We want lockdowns, we want tests” after reportedly being told not to chant the opposite.\n\nProtesters in Shanghai hold up pieces of white paper to symbolize censorship, November 27.

In Shanghai, huge barricades were erected to prevent crowds from congregating on sidewalks, while police officers checked passengers’ cell phones on the street and on subway trains, according to eyewitnesses and videos on social media.\n\nIn a veiled warning, the Communist Party’s domestic security committee vowed to “strike hard against infiltration and sabotage activities by hostile forces, as well as criminal activities that destabilize social order,” according to state media.\n\nOthers in Beijing described receiving phone calls from authorities asking about their participation. One protester told CNN they received a call on Wednesday from a police officer, who revealed that their cell phone signal had been detected near a protest site three days before.\n\nAccording to a recording of the phone conversation heard by CNN, the protester denied being near the site that night – to which the officer asked, “Then why did your cell phone number show up there?”\n\nPolice form a cordon during a protest in Beijing on November 27. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nAt the same time as the crackdown, health officials tried to appease the public, acknowledging in a news conference on Tuesday that some Covid control measures had been implemented “excessively.” Authorities were adjusting measures to “limit the impact on people as much as possible,” they said, reiterating similar recent statements.\n\nThe promises failed to soothe some listeners who seethed in comments on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, where the conference was livestreamed. “You’ve lost all credibility,” one said. Another wrote: “We’ve cooperated with you for three years. Now, it’s time to give our freedom back.”\n\nThe following day, a top official gave the clearest indication yet that the country was considering a new direction.\n\n“With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China’s pandemic containment faces (a) new stage and mission,” said Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, who oversees the country’s Covid response, according to state media.\n\nSeveral cities moved quickly to loosen restrictions. On Friday, Beijing’s municipal government reversed rules set just 10 days ago that required residents to show a negative Covid-19 test taken in the previous 48 hours to board public transport in the capital city.\n\nTianjin and Chengdu also scrapped requirements for commuters to present a negative test result, effective immediately, according to notices from both cities’ metro operators on Friday.\n\nIn Chongqing and Guangzhou, close contacts of positive cases can quarantine at home instead of at a government facility. Several lockdowns were also lifted, including in Zhengzhou and in Guangzhou.\n\nWhile these measures are expected to bring some relief, authorities have repeatedly voiced concerns that vaccination rates aren’t high enough to fully open up without risking spikes in Covid deaths.\n\nChina recorded 34,772 new Covid cases on Thursday, then 32,827 on Friday, continuing a downward trend in daily infections from record highs on November 27.\n\nAs of Friday, thousands of buildings and residential communities across China remain under lockdown restrictions due to their classification as “high risk.”\n\n\n\nIt’s not opening up, don’t misinterpret this Comment on Weibo\n\nOne user on Weibo urged authorities to further relax rules “so people can live a normal life,” warning that strict Covid measures could push some too far.\n\n“If they don’t open up soon, people will really go crazy,” one comment read.\n\nAnother wrote: “The pressure is too great.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Carlotta Dotto Henrik Pettersson", "Jessie Yeung", "Carlotta Dotto", "Henrik Pettersson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/04/10/why-international-travelers-avoid-the-us/82979308007/", "title": "As border scrutiny grows, foreign visitors rethink travel to the US", "text": "April 10, 2025 Updated April 11, 2025, 11:20 a.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary Increased scrutiny at U.S. borders and recent detainments are causing some international travelers to reconsider visiting the U.S.\n\nSome travelers are opting for alternative destinations like Canada due to the current political climate and rhetoric.\n\nExperts warn that the shift away from the U.S. as a travel destination could have long-term economic consequences.\n\nRyan Estrada and Kim Hyun Sook recently made the difficult decision to cancel their monthslong visit to the United States this summer. They had spent years planning this trip, sacrificing others for this major one – Kim even denied renewing her job contract for it.\n\nCartoon artist Estrada and his wife Kim, a Korean graphic novel author, have been living in her home country for the past several years. This trip was their opportunity to visit Estrada's family and also meet with libraries across the country to talk about the books that they collaborate on. Kim was planning to be in the United States on a tourist visa for the permitted three months while Estrada, an American-born citizen, was going to arrive earlier and leave later.\n\nThey were all set for their trip when they heard the news about graphic artist Rebecca Burke being detained and banned from the United States. The British national, who was using homestays for her accommodations, was attempting to travel from Seattle to Vancouver during a backpacking sojourn throughout North America.\n\n\"She's a friend of friends, and it just kind of scared me,\" Estrada said. \"And everything after that, it seemed like every day there were two or three new stories that touched on exactly what we were afraid of.\" By that, he means the high-profile detainments and deportations of several green card holders, the enhanced scrutiny at U.S. borders, and the overall agenda of increased national security by the Trump administration. Even some U.S. citizens are hesitant to travel outside the country's borders.\n\nKnowing they were bringing art supplies with them, plus the fact that Kim's books – one being a fictional illustrated account about living under a South Korean military regime in the 1980s – are banned in four states, the couple felt going on the trip was just too risky.\n\nNeed a news break?

I thought people, even older relatives, would just be like, oh, you're overreacting. But my mom was like, 'yeah, don't come. It's too dangerous.' \"\n\nAmid recent travel advisories warning those coming to the United States plus strengthened immigration enforcement, many international travelers are starting to turn away from the U.S. as a destination. Between January and March, foreign arrivals dropped by around 4.4% from those first three months last year, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. In a March year-over-year comparison, that reduction doubles to almost 10%.\n\nAt Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport – consistently ranked the busiest airport in the world and a hub for international connections – 189,973 non-U.S. passengers passed through its terminals between March 1 and April 7, according to data by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That's an almost 5% decrease from the same time last year.\n\nSome fear for their safety over what could happen when trying to enter the nation's borders. Others are angered at recent policies, like the trade wars, and rhetoric, refusing to spend their dollars in the U.S. A decline in overseas visitors could have significant long-term consequences for the economy, with travel and tourism one of the country's leading industries, contributing 2.5% to the gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Travel Association.\n\n\"It's shaking everything up,\" said Hicham Jaddoud, professor of tourism at the University of Southern California Bovard College. \"We have seen also how these tourists that used to come to the U.S. decide to change their direction are looking at different destinations ... That's gonna impact that return rate or the acquisition cost of consumers coming back to the U.S. There are a lot of concerns, obviously, and they're all backed by data and numbers.\"\n\nHow is the travel industry being impacted?\n\nEarlier this year, the National Trade and Tourism Office predicted a positive forecast for 2025's international visitor numbers. Over the past several years, travel to the United States has been steadily increasing, with last year seeing 72.4 million international arrivals, up from 66.3 million in 2023.\n\nHowever, the U.S. tourism industry is already starting to see a flurry of cancellations across the board, from business to leisure and family travel. \"That cancellation impacts, obviously, hotel reservations, restaurants, every element that deals with tourism,\" said Jaddoud. In 2024, spending by international visitors generated $2.9 trillion in economic output. It supported 15 million jobs, from the more obvious hotel workers to indirect services like taxi drivers, according to the U.S. Travel Association. Canadian travelers alone spent $20.5 billion, and just a 10% reduction could mean a loss of $2.1 billion.\n\nLast month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged his citizens to \"choose Canada\" for their travels rather than going to the United States – and they are.\n\nNot only are airline bookings from Canada to the United States plummeting – down more than 70% each month through the end of September – but carriers are cutting flights by 3.5% between the two countries. \"This sharp drop suggests that travelers are holding off on making reservations, likely due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the broader trade dispute,\" the firm said in a statement, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\n\nBased just outside of Toronto, Jodi Gibson and his family were frequent travelers to the United States, often going to Cleveland with his season tickets for the Browns football team and hitting East Coast cities like New York for Broadway shows. He and his extended family just canceled their upcoming Orlando, Florida, trip to visit Disney theme parks over the unstable political climate. Trump's recent remarks that Canada should become the 51st state was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\n\"I canceled my season tickets this year. I just thought you know for the next four years, my money can be better spent somewhere where they don't have a leader trying to annex my country,\" Gibson said. Instead, the family plans to travel domestically in Canada and explore Ireland and Scotland.\n\nJaddoud warns that a loss of travelers won't just be for the short-term, but that impact could last for years. \"A shift toward alternative destinations, that was something that really kept me up at night as a result of all of these factors,\" he said. \"We have seen a noticeable shift among international travelers to go toward other destinations. As I mentioned, like Canada, for instance, has become increasingly attractive for Europeans.\"\n\nIf travelers have a good experience elsewhere, they may not choose to return to the United States. even if the political landscape changes.\n\nAlthough saddened by the loss of his trip and the uncertain future of his home country, Estrada feels confident in his decision to avoid taking his wife to the United States, even though he doesn't know when they can ever make that visit. \"They've made it clear that any reason is good enough,\" he said. \"So, if you're hearing a story about someone this is happening to, and in your mind you're like, there must've been a reason. Look at what some of the reasons have been in the past and realize that could be you.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/12/ice-tourist-detention-border-trump-immigration/82740260007/", "title": "Tourists detained by ICE treated like 'the worst criminal'", "text": "April 12, 2025 Updated April 15, 2025, 3:52 p.m. ET\n\nAmid an immigration crackdown, detention facilities have become overcrowded.\n\nThese uncommon detainees are decrying ICE detention conditions.\n\nA British backpacker. A Harvard researcher. A Canadian actress. An Australian mixed martial arts coach. Dozens of international college students.\n\nThe Trump administration's sweeping immigration-and-visa crackdown has begun ensnaring a class of people long-accustomed to being welcomed with open arms into the United States.\n\nAnd those uncommon detainees are bringing new attention to the often-harsh U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention system, where people can be held without charge indefinitely, sometimes in shocking conditions, or abruptly removed from the country.\n\nThis type of treatment has long been the case in ICE detention, but the people held by the government often didn't have the resources ‒ the access, language or middle-class expectations ‒ to denounce the conditions.\n\nNow, with President Donald Trump's crackdown, native English speakers, people with PhDs, and others are getting the word out to a broader public about a system they describe as arbitrary and punishing ‒ although ICE detention is not supposed to resemble prison.\n\n\"It's insane how easily someone can take away your freedom, lock you in a federal prison, without a clear reason. No explanation. No warning,\" Australian MMA coach Renato Subotic wrote in an Instagram post after being detained in early April. \"Just like that, you’re treated like the worst criminal.\"\n\nLike the other detained travelers, Subotic said he was trying to enter the United States with a visa and was handcuffed after customs officers identified a paperwork problem. Instead of being refused entry to the United States and put on a flight back home, Subotic said he was taken to a chaotic federal detention center for 24 hours.\n\nTrump campaigned on tough new immigration enforcement, particularly targeting violent offenders living illegally within the United States. But the crackdown has swept in everyday foreign travelers and tourists, too ‒ resulting in detention for infractions that previously would have gotten a severe glare or a $500 fine.\n\n\"I believe in respecting the rules. But putting someone in federal prison over a missing detail in a visa application?\" Subotic wrote in his post. \"Now I’m back in Australia, I’ll speak with my lawyers. Something has to be done about the way I was treated. Hope this never happen to nobody else.\"\n\nUSA TODAY asked ICE whether foreign travelers should expect to be detained on an infraction of customs or immigration law. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment regarding its detention practices.\n\nNot supposed to be punishment\n\nBecause immigration and visa violations are civil, not criminal matters, ICE detention is supposed to be \"non-punitive,\" according to the agency's own guidelines.\n\nBut conditions vary widely in the sprawling detention network overseen by ICE, which includes government-run and contracted facilities, said Deb Fleischaker, a former ICE official who served under the Biden administration and the first Trump administration.\n\n\"Legally, it is civil detention, not criminal detention,\" Fleischaker said. But \"by and large, people are treated like they are in jail.\"\n\nWhen the system gets overcrowded, conditions can deteriorate, she said. ICE held nearly 48,000 people in detention in early April, according to agency data. Last year, Congress provided funding for a daily average maximum of 41,500 immigration detention beds.\n\n\"Obviously, things get worse when the system is overburdened, when ICE contractors are overwhelmed and overworked,\" Fleischaker said, adding that problems used to be detected and fixed by internal review systems.\n\nBut the Trump administration recently eliminated two key oversight offices, the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.\n\nDetention or 'kidnapping'?\n\nCanadian entrepreneur-turned-actress Jasmine Mooney described an experience similar to Subotic's, but far longer. She described her 12-day ICE detention in The Guardian newspaper as a \"kidnapping.\" She was shuffled from site to site after she tried to enter the United States at the Mexican border, as she'd done many times before.\n\nICE officials left her shivering in cold rooms as she tried to make sense of her detention, she wrote.\n\nLegally, immigration officers couldn't send her back to Mexico, because she's a Canadian citizen. But in years past, agents might have escorted her to the San Diego airport and put her on a one-way flight to Vancouver, experts told USA TODAY.\n\n\"One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the U.S.,\" she wrote. \"The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before being sent to an ICE detention center without the chance to talk to a lawyer.\"\n\nMooney said she was one of 140 women in her dormitory. Many had overstayed visas, often after working in the United States for years and applying to stay but being denied.\n\n\"If someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets,\" she wrote, but these women didn't have criminal records and they took responsibility for overstaying their visas. \"Their frustration wasn’t about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.\"\n\nBritish backpacker Rebecca Burke did chores for her U.S. host family. ICE detained her for 19 days, claiming she should have requested work permission, not a tourist visa, despite having been allowed into the United States under the same circumstances previously.\n\nBurke said she was handcuffed, shackled, had her shoelaces cut off and then discovered the ICE agent assigned to her case had gone on vacation while she was detained in a room with 100 other women.\n\nHarvard Medical School researcher Kseniia Petrova has remained in ICE detention for more than seven weeks with no end date in sight.\n\nThe Russian native was returning from Paris to Boston Logan International Airport in February, with specimens for her lab's genetics research that customs officers said she failed to properly declare. She arrived with her J1 work-study visa; she was in good standing and had never entered the country unlawfully.\n\nTypically, when a traveler fails to properly declare an import, customs officers confiscate the product. Sometimes they issue a fine. In Petrova's case, they withheld her visa. ICE sent her to a privately run Louisiana detention center and has refused to release her or allow her to return to Europe.\n\nPetrova said she told CBP officers she feared returning to Russia because of her pro-Ukrainian political activism. Her Harvard colleagues and 17 U.S. senators have urged ICE to release her.\n\n'Immigration enforcement on steroids'\n\nLongtime immigration attorney Len Saunders, who is based near the Canadian border in Blaine, Washington, called the Trump approach \"scorched earth.\" He said border agents and customs officers have long had discretion to let in someone whose paperwork isn't perfect, giving them a grace period if necessary.\n\nThat changed with Trump's January inauguration, he said.\n\n\"It's like immigration enforcement on steroids,\" said Saunders, who helped advise Mooney. \"These cases happened in the past but not to the same degree as now.\"\n\nBut Saunders also noted that the conditions and uncertainty Mooney, Subotic and others experienced reflects standard practice once someone is in the immigration detention system.\n\nHe said there's typically a lack of urgency, especially because there aren't enough immigration judges to hold hearings swiftly. In criminal court, defendants are entitled by the 6th Amendment to speedy prosecutions. But in immigration court, detainees can languish for weeks or months.\n\n\"As an immigrant to this country, that would be my worst nightmare, ending up in one those places,\" Saunders said. \"I feel sorry for these people.\"\n\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/14/dhs-agents-deportation-not-trafficking/78641666007/", "title": "DHS agents shift to deportation instead of trafficking", "text": "Feb. 14, 2025 Updated Feb. 15, 2025, 12:11 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security has ordered its entire investigations division - composed of 6,000 agents - to divert focus on drug dealers, terrorists, and human traffickers and shift priority to the Trump administration’s mission of deporting people in the U.S. illegally, USA TODAY has learned.\n\nThe new focus for DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations agency (HSI), current and former officials say, is in keeping with recent executive orders signed by President Donald Trump that demand a wholesale shift in federal law enforcement resources toward immigration crackdowns and removal.\n\nBut they warn the shift will undermine high-profile investigations into some of the most dangerous transnational threats Americans face, including Mexican drug cartels smuggling deadly fentanyl across the border from Mexico.\n\n“A lot of my colleagues were afraid this was going to happen,” after Trump won election on a hardline immigration platform, said Chris Cappannelli, a former HSI supervisory agent. “This is going to be a total train wreck.”\n\n“Some of my friends short of mandatory retirement yet eligible are rushing to get their retirement paperwork in,” Cappannelli told USA TODAY. “Others are looking for other law enforcement jobs outside of DHS where they won’t have to be chasing migrants. This isn’t what they signed up for – or the best use of their skills and experience.”\n\nAsked about the shift, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin would only say that all DHS agents, including those at HSI, are now fulfilling the department’s “primary mission of protecting America through the arrest and removal of illegal aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and the integrity of our nation’s immigration laws.”\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has moved quickly since being sworn in Jan. 25 to deploy federal and state agents from across the government in the hunt for people in the country illegally. Last week, she asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to detail IRS agents who normally investigate tax fraud and money laundering to help \"secure the southern border and enforce immigration laws.\"\n\nKenneth MacDonald, another former HSI supervisory agent and a former White House official, said other critical threats could go uninvestigated by HSI, which he described as the second largest U.S. federal investigative law enforcement agency after the FBI. Those include child exploitation crimes, cyberattacks and Dark Web financial schemes, Iranian and Chinese nuclear traffickers, Russian organized crime, trade fraud and sanctions investigations.\n\n“Anything that crosses the border, both electronically and digitally or physically, those things are within the purview of HSI. It’s something like 400 statutes that we’re responsible for enforcing,” MacDonald said.\n\nThe directive could also threaten ongoing investigations and prosecutions, many of which are multi-agency efforts that have been years in the making – like several ongoing cases against the Sinaloa Cartel and other Mexican and Chinese transnational crime syndicates, current and former officials said.\n\n“I know there’s a lot of concern,” MacDonald added. “No one has a problem if this is short term. But if this is the foreseeable future, internally there are going to be lots of problems” and even more protests.\n\nHSI agents playing central roles in top national security investigations\n\nEarlier this month, HSI agents played a key role in helping Dominican Republic authorities seize an aircraft used by the sanctioned Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural-gas company based on violations of U.S. export control and sanctions laws.\n\nIn another case two weeks ago, HSI agents helped investigate and arrest two men on charges of participating in a neo-Nazi child exploitation enterprise that groomed and then coerced minors around the world into producing produce child sexual abuse material.\n\nAnd they have been instrumental in investigating and extraditing from Mexico alleged Sinaloa Cartel cell leader Octavio Leal-Hernandez, who the Justice Department said is responsible for trafficking large amounts of methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin and marijuana into the United States from Mexico.\n\n“The arrest and extradition of Leal-Hernandez marks a significant victory in our relentless fight against the deadly scourge of narcotics trafficking,” Shawn Gibson, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego said Jan. 23. Gibson and other federal officials said Leal-Hernandez’s extradition was based on a joint HSI/ Drug Enforcement Administration investigation that began in 2012.\n\nHSI agents now 'supporting the nation’s whole-of-government immigration enforcement efforts,' official says\n\nOne senior U.S. law enforcement official said no current DHS officials want to voice concern publicly because the Trump administration has launched numerous probes and disciplinary actions against suspected leakers of internal policy changes.\n\n“In the same way other federal law enforcement agencies and the Department of Defense are currently supporting the nation’s whole-of-government immigration enforcement efforts, ICE is focusing all its law enforcement personnel on mitigating public safety threats and preserving the integrity of our immigration laws,” McLaughlin told USA TODAY.\n\nTechnically, the Homeland Security Investigations division has always resided within ICE, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement, one of the main agencies within the sprawling Department of Homeland Security that was established soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to better protect Americans from domestic and foreign threats.\n\nBut HSI has fought for years for independence from ICE, saying its almost singular focus on what’s known as Enforcement and Removal Operations has sharply undercut its ability to investigate crimes that have little or no connection to illegal immigration – including transnational criminal networks in the United States and around the world.\n\nThat was especially the case in California and “sanctuary cities” like New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles that prohibit or limit their police departments and government officials from cooperating with ICE for fear of helping in the deportation of undocumented residents.\n\nCappannelli, who retired in 2022, and MacDonald, who retired in 2013, said HSI’s association with ICE, including using ICE email accounts, letterhead and even raid jacket insignias, hamstrung their efforts to cultivate sources and informants.\n\nYears of efforts to separate HSI from the 'undue toxicity' of ICE and its deportation efforts\n\nTrump’s promise to deport millions of immigrants during his first presidency had made HSI’s association with ICE exponentially worse, they said, especially in its efforts to fight drug cartels and conduct major investigations in the country’s biggest cities.\n\nMany HSI officials wrote a protest letter in 2018, asking then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to break up ICE because other jurisdictions were agreeing to partner with HSI only if “the ‘ICE’ name is excluded from any public facing information,” The Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nThen, in December 2021, senior HSI agents sent an internal report to President Joe Biden’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, urging him to let them become a standalone agency divorced from ICE. They cited 77 instances in which HSI’s affiliation with ICE “had hurt relations with state and local law enforcement, colleges and universities, and community groups, making it difficult to recruit new agents and build trust with victims of crime,” The Post reported.\n\nLast April, HSI announced a crucial victory in that effort, gaining its own website scrubbed of any links to ICE. They also got new email addresses and raid jackets for agents in 220 cities in the U.S. and 80 locations overseas, and even a team of publicists and other officials to help with their “rebranding,” the senior federal law enforcement official told USA TODAY.\n\nHSI’s new “independent branding” would allow its agents “to work without the undue toxicity that in some places comes with the ICE moniker,” Patrick Lechleitner, ICE’s acting director at the time, told The Washington Post.\n\n“They’ll still be part of ICE, just like the Marines are part of the Department of the Navy,” Lechleitner said then.\n\nIn recent weeks, though, the HSI agents have been told they are now migrating back to the old system, in which they and the enforcement and removal agents are all focusing on deportations.\n\nThe massive redeployment of HSI agents was also recommended by Project 2025, the sweeping and controversial policy blueprint for Trump's second term that Trump distanced himself from on the campaign trail but has since adopted in large measure.\n\nIt said DHS should \"refocus HSI on immigration offenses and criminal offenses typically associated with immigration (for example, human trafficking ). All criminal investigative work without a clear nexus to the border or otherwise to Title 8 should be turned over to the appropriate federal agency.\"\n\nCappannelli said one HSI agent involved in complex multi-agency criminal investigations is now chasing border crossers out of a remote station in Eagle Pass, Texas. He said he fears the wholesale redeployment of agents will have a devastating effect on ongoing investigations and prosecutions that require their continued assistance.\n\n“Imagine one of these guys having to tell a prosecutor, ‘Hey I can’t make it to court to testify on your case because I’m at the border'” looking for undocumented immigrants.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/asia/india-hindu-extremist-groups-intl-hnk-dst", "title": "India's Hindu extremists are calling for genocide against Muslims ...", "text": "Delhi, India CNN —\n\nAt a conference in India last month, a Hindu extremist dressed head-to-toe in the religion’s holy color, saffron, called on her supporters to kill Muslims and “protect” the country.\n\n“If 100 of us become soldiers and are prepared to kill 2 million (Muslims), then we will win … protect India, and make it a Hindu nation,” said Pooja Shakun Pandey, a senior member of the right-wing Hindu Mahasabha political party, according to a video of the event.\n\nHer words and calls for violence from other religious leaders were met with a roar of applause from the large audience, a video from the three-day conference in the northern Indian city of Haridwar shows.\n\nBut across India, people were outraged. Nearly a month on, many are still furious at the lack of government response or arrests over the comments, which they say highlights a worsening climate for the country’s Muslims.\n\nAfter mounting pressure, India’s top court intervened on Wednesday, asking for a response from state and federal authorities within 10 days.\n\nPandey and several others are being investigated by local police for insulting religious beliefs, a charge that carries a possible sentence of up to four years in prison, Haridwar police officials told CNN.\n\nNeither Pandey, nor the others, have publicly commented about the outcry or investigations.\n\nLate Thursday, police in Uttarakhand state, where Haridwar is located, arrested a man who spoke at the event, senior Haridwar Police official Shekhar Suyal told CNN. It is unclear what the man said at the event. Police have not formally charged anyone with any crime.\n\nCNN has contacted India’s Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Hindu Mahasabha and Pandey, but has not received a response.\n\nAnalysts say the Hindu Mahasabha is at the tip of a broader trend in India which has seen an alarming rise in support for extremist Hindu nationalist groups since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power nearly eight years ago.\n\nAlthough these groups aren’t directly associated with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his own Hindu nationalist agenda, and the lack of repercussions for these groups’ previous vitriolic comments, has given them tacit support, making them even more brazen, analysts say.\n\nAnalysts fear this rise poses a serious danger to minorities, especially Muslims – and worry it may only get worse as several Indian states head to the polls in the coming months.\n\n“What makes the Hindu Mahasabha dangerous,” said Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University near India’s capital, New Delhi, “is that they have been waiting for a moment like this in decades.”\n\nRise of the right-wing Hindu group\n\nFounded in 1907 during British rule at a time of growing conflict between Muslims and Hindus in the country, the Hindu Mahasabha is one of India’s oldest political organizations.\n\nThe group didn’t support British rule, but it didn’t back India’s freedom movement either, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was particularly tolerant of Muslims. Even now, some members of the group worship his assassin, Nathuram Godse.\n\nThe Hindu Mahasabha’s vision, according to the group’s official website, is to declare India the “National Home of the Hindus.” The website says if it takes power, it will not hesitate to “force” the migration of India’s Muslims to neighboring Pakistan and vows to reform the country’s education system to align it with their version of Hinduism.\n\nWith its controversial campaigns and ideology, Hindu Mahasabha has always been a marginal political force. The last time the group had a presence in Parliament was in 1991.\n\nBut according to Verniers, their “strength is not to be measured in electoral terms.” And in the past eight years since Modi came to power, they appear to have expanded in numbers and influence based on the size and frequency of their meetings, he said.\n\nWhile the group does not publicly disclose how many members it has, Verniers said they are “comfortably in the tens of thousands.”\n\nHindu Mahasabha targets rural communities in northern states, where there is a large BJP presence, encouraging them to vote for parties that align with their Hindu-nationalist ideology, including Modi’s BJP, Verniers said.\n\nModi, in turn, has publicly honored the Hindu Mahasabha’s late leader, Veer Savarkar, for “his bravery” and “emphasis on social reform.”\n\nNathuram Godse's statue is adroned with a garland at the Hindu Mahasabha office in New Delhi. K Asif/The India Today Group/Getty Images\n\nAnd as Hindu Mahasabha has grown in recent years, it has become more outspoken.\n\nIn 2015, Sadhvi Deva Thakur, then a senior member of the group, caused widespread controversy when she told reporters Muslims and Christians should undergo forced sterilization to control their population growth. CNN has reached out to her for comment.\n\nPandey, who spoke at the December conference in Haridwar, was arrested in February 2019 after a video showed her shooting an effigy of Gandhi, according to CNN affiliate CNN News-18. Photos uploaded to her official Facebook page last May show her worshiping a statue of Gandhi’s assassin. CNN has not been able to confirm whether she was formally charged over the February 2019 incident.\n\nHindu Mahasabha isn’t the only right-wing Hindu nationalist group to espouse violent sentiment toward liberals and minorities – including India’s 200 million Muslims, who make up 15% of the country’s 1.3 billion population.\n\nAt last month’s conference, several speakers called on India’s Hindus to “defend” the religion with weapons. Another called for the “cleansing” of India’s minorities, according to video from the event.\n\nBut according to Verniers, Hindu Mahasbha one of the largest right-wing political groups aiming to make India the land of the Hindus.\n\nAnd while the group’s campaigns and ideas are decades old, they’re more bold about them now.\n\n“The escalation of their hate speech is reflective of the state of affairs in India,” said Verniers. “But they are able to get away with it more.”\n\nThousands of people gather to mark protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act law in Delhi, India, on January 26, 2020. Javed Sultan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nActing with impunity\n\nThe reason extremist groups appear to be on the rise is clear, according to experts: they have impunity and support.\n\nIndia prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes “deliberate and malicious acts” intended to insult religious beliefs.\n\nAccording to lawyer Vrinda Grover, any group inciting violence is barred under Indian law.\n\n“Police, states and the government are responsible to ensure (inciting violence) doesn’t happen,” she said. “But the state, through its inaction, is actually permitting these groups to function, while endangering Muslims who are the targets.”\n\nPandey’s rant and some of the other calls for violence were the “worst form of hate speech,” according to Verniers.\n\n“This is the first time I find myself using the term ‘genocide’ in Indian politics,” he said, referring to the comments made at last month’s conference. “They have tacit support in the form of government silence.”\n\nThat’s because Modi also has a Hindu nationalist agenda, experts say.\n\nModi swept to power in India in 2014, promising economic reform and development for the country.\n\nBut starting from his first term as Prime Minister, minority groups and analysts say they began to see a significant shift in India’s ideology from a secular to a Hindu nationalist state.\n\nThe BJP has its roots in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing-Hindu group that counts Modi among its members. Many RSS members are adherents of the Hindutva ideology that the Hindu Mahasabha preach – to make India the land of the Hindus.\n\nIn 2018, India’s current Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were “termites” and promised to rid the nation of them.\n\nThe BJP’s Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of the north Indian state Uttar Pradesh, known for his anti-Muslim views, once compared Muslim Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed, the alleged planner of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, according to the Press Trust of India.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, vigilante groups killed dozens of people – many of whom were Muslims – for allegedly consuming or killing cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus, according to a report from Human Rights Watch.\n\nModi publicly condemned some of the killings, but the violence continued, and in 2017, his government attempted to ban the sale and slaughter of cows –currently illegal in several Indian states – nationwide.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inauguratea the Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor, Varanasi, on December 13, 2021. Sanjay Kanojia/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHuman Rights Watch said many of the alleged murders went unpunished in part due to delayed police investigations and “rhetoric” from ruling party politicians, which may have incited mob violence.\n\nIn 2019, India’s Parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims. It led to extended protests and international condemnation.\n\nIn December 2020, Uttar Pradesh enacted a controversial anti-conversion law, making it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity.\n\nOther states, including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Assam, introduced similar laws, leading to widespread harassment and, in some cases, arrests for interfaith couples, Christian priests and pastors.\n\nThe chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state Yogi Adityanath addresses a public rally in Allahabad on December 26, 2021. Sanjay Kanojia/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAll of this has only served to encourage extremist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha, say experts.\n\nZakia Soman, a women’s rights activist and co-founder of the Muslim group Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said “a failure of governance” had given rise to more right-wing extremists.\n\n“Our community is realizing that we have become second-class citizens in our own country,” Soman said. “Minority bashing and hate is becoming regular and normalized. As the intensity increases, the venom and violence in their language also increases.”\n\nA 21-year-old Muslim student in Delhi, who chose to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from right-wing groups, said Muslims are filled with “a sense of fear” every time right-wing Hindu groups make hateful comments.\n\n“It gives us a sense that we don’t belong here,” he said.\n\nThe future of the Hindu-right\n\nDespite police investigations and public outrage, legal action against those who spoke and were present at December’s event have been slow.\n\nIn a letter submitted to Modi on Friday and seen by CNN, students and faculty of the prestigious Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and Ahmedabad said his silence “emboldens” hate, adding there is “sense of fear” among minority groups in India.\n\nSome experts agree the government’s silence has only emboldened these groups further.\n\n“Hate speech precedes hate crimes,” Grover, the lawyer, said. “And we are witnessing a crescendo of hate crimes. These groups are rapidly spreading poison through society.”\n\nA 2019 US intelligence report warned that parliamentary elections in India increase the possibility of communal violence if Modi’s BJP “stresses Hindu nationalist themes.” It added that state leaders “might view a Hindu-nationalist campaign as a signal to incite low-level violence to animate their supporters.”\n\nThe BJP – which rarely gives statements on the issue – says it does not discriminate against minorities, adding in a statement last March that it “treats all its citizens with equality” and “laws are applied without discrimination.”\n\nBut analysts fear the BJP’s divisive politics will could lead to increased violence against minority groups in the lead up to pivotal state elections this year.\n\nAnd reported episodes of violence against Muslims have already increased ahead of this year’s state elections.\n\nIn December, crowds of India’s Hindu-right confronted Muslims praying on the streets in the city of Gurugram, just outside of Delhi. They prevented Muslims from praying, while shouting slogans and carrying banners in protest.\n\n“It is an electoral strategy,” said Verniers, the political scientist. “Create religious tension, activate religious polarization and consolidate on the Hindu vote.”\n\nGrover, the lawyer, said criminal laws are “weaponized” in India, adding anyone who challenges those in power “face the wrath of the law.”\n\n“Muslim lives in India are demonized,” she said. “The Indian state is in serious crisis.”\n\nOn January 1, Pandey held a live broadcast for her more than 1,500 Facebook followers. The subject was “Religious Parliament,” her post said.\n\nFor the 21-year-old student, it is difficult to “expect any sense of justice” for Indian Muslims. He says even having a Muslim name is enough to make him feel unsafe.\n\n“It is really scary to carry the Muslim identity in India today.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul Swati Gupta", "Rhea Mogul", "Swati Gupta"], "publish_date": "2022/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/middleeast/iran-evin-prison-fire-survivors-guards-tear-gas-intl-hnk", "title": "Iran Evin prison fire: Inmates say guards fired tear gas after deadly ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDetails of a chaotic night marked by tear gas and explosions have emerged from an Iranian prison following a deadly fire at the facility on Saturday.\n\nThe death toll from the blaze at Tehran’s Evin prison has risen to eight, state-aligned news agency Tasnim posted on Twitter Monday. Citing Iranian authorities, earlier reports by state-run news agency IRNA said dozens of others were injured after prisoners set fire to a warehouse.\n\nThe notoriously brutal facility is known for housing political prisoners in the country, which has seen mass protests in recent weeks against the Islamic regime that has ruled it for decades.\n\nAward-winning film director Jafar Panahi, 62, who is among the dissidents jailed at Evin, said guards fired tear gas at inmates, according to his wife, Tahereh Saeedi.\n\nIn an interview with Radio Farda – the Iranian branch of the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty – Saeedi said her husband called her from the prison and told her that he and fellow jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof are in good health.\n\nSaeedi added that from the time the fire broke out Saturday night to when she got a call from her husband the next day were the worst hours of her life.\n\nActivist group 1500tasvir reported earlier that, in videos posted on social media, gunshots were heard and Iranian special forces were seen heading to the area where the prison is believed to be located.\n\nSources inside the prison told pro-reform outlet IranWire that guards fired tear gas all night after the fire broke out. In many cases, prisoners had to break their windows to so they could breathe, IranWire reported.\n\nIn a Twitter post Sunday, human rights activist and former Evin inmate Atena Daemi said tear gas was fired by security officials, citing a woman prisoner.\n\nInmates on Ward 8 have no water, gas, or bread and 45 of them were transferred “to an unknown place,” Daemi said. “Now everyone is fine, but they are worried about being transferred to other prisons, solitary confinement and interrogation.”\n\nMany inmates had been transferred to Rajaei Shahr prison, about 20 kilometers west (12 miles) of Tehran, Mostafa Nili, a lawyer who represents a number of prisoners, said on Twitter. Video from IranWire shows a bus taking prisoners away from Evin.\n\nAll eight prisoners who died had been jailed for theft, Tasnim reported Monday, citing Iran’s judiciary media center.\n\n‘Terrifying sounds’\n\nJailed journalist Niloofar Hamedi is also safe following Saturday’s fire, according to a tweet from her husband, Mohamad Hosein.\n\n“She told me she didn’t know what had happened at Evin last night but said that she heard the terrifying sounds and thought something terrible happened,” Hosein said his wife told him, adding she was doing well.\n\nHosein said Hamedi is being held in Evin’s Section 209 – notorious for housing prisoners of conscience – and did not have information about other areas of the prison.\n\nIranian-American Siamak Namazi, who has been detained in Iran for seven years and was forced to return to prison on Wednesday after briefly being released on furlough, is also safe, according to the Namazi family lawyer Jared Genser.\n\nNamazi was moved to a secure area of the prison and has spoken to his family, Genser said.\n\nA workshop at Evin prison in Tehran on Oct. 16, 2022 following the blaze.

Iranian authorities have since unleashed a brutal and deadly crackdown on demonstrators, who have united around a range of grievances with the country’s authoritarian regime.\n\n“No prisoner is safe in Iran, where people are maimed and killed for criticizing the state,” the head of New York-based Independent Center for Human Rights in Iran, Hadi Ghaemi tweeted Sunday. “Political prisoners in Evin & Iran should be freed. All prisoners should have proper medical treatment + access to counsel/families.”\n\nGhaemi also urged the United Nations to hold Iran’s leaders accountable in a call echoed by Amnesty International secretary general and former UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard.\n\nA special session of the UN Human Rights Council should be held to create a “UN investigative and accountability mechanism on Iran government and religious authorities,” Callamard said in a tweet Sunday, citing “far too many crimes against the Iranian people.”", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian Hira Humayun", "Artemis Moshtaghian", "Hira Humayun"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/middleeast/iran-unicef-children-death-intl", "title": "Children's deaths 'must stop' in Iran, says UNICEF, as protests ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United Nations children’s agency, UNICEF, said it remains deeply concerned by reports of children being killed, injured, and detained in Iran, it said in a statement on Friday, adding that the reported deaths of children at anti-government protests “must stop.”\n\nAn “estimated 50 children have reportedly lost their lives in the public unrest in Iran,” UNICEF said in the statement.\n\nThis comes as the unrest in Iran has continued for more than two months, and amid increasing calls from protesters and activists online to UNICEF, Amnesty International and other human rights organizations to take action on human rights violations and crimes against children taking plane in Iran.\n\nMany tell CNN that they feel their voices have not been heard. “They just say, hey, Islamic Republic, what are you doing is bad,” one protester in Iran told CNN. “Yes, everybody knows it’s bad.

I believe they know better than us what they can do.”\n\n“In Iran, UNICEF remains deeply concerned by reports of children being killed, injured, and detained,” the statement read, citing the death of a young boy named Kian Pirfalak, one of seven people killed during Wednesday’s protests in the southwestern city of Izeh. “This is terrifying and must stop,” the organization added.\n\nUNICEF reported Pirfalak’s age as 10-years-old.

Nor can media directly access the government for their account on such cases, unless there is reporting on state media, the mouthpiece of the government.\n\n‘My broken flower’\n\nVideo shared by activist group 1500 Tasvir and others showed a large crowd gathered for Pirfalak funeral in his hometown in Izeh Friday.\n\nSurrounded by mourners, his mother Zeynab Molaeirad is heard singing a children’s song, replacing the lyrics with words against Ayatollah Khamenei and the regime. She then reveals new details about the fatal incident, according to a video shared on social media.\n\n“Hear it from my mouth what really happened to Kian,” she told the crowd, “So the regime doesn’t lie and say it was a terrorist.”\n\nMolaeirad, who was traveling with her family in their car, said people on the street yelled at the vehicle to turn back and that her son told his father not to worry.\n\n“Kian said: ‘Baba trust the police for once and turn around, they are looking out for us,’” she said.\n\nHis father made a U-turn and drove towards the police, his mother said. But “because the car windows were rolled up, the police thought we may have wanted to shoot at them,” she said.\n\n“They opened a barrage of fire on the car.”\n\nKian’s mother also posted a photo with her son in her Instagram post. “My broken flower. Curse on the Islamic Republic,” she wrote.\n\nHuman rights groups have accused Iranian authorities of scaring victims’ families to silence. Iranian authorities are “systematically harassing and intimidating victims’ families to hide the truth” of their deaths, as Amnesty International’s Heba Morayef said in a recent report.\n\nThe United Nations on Friday said it was “deeply worried about growing violence related to the ongoing popular protests in Iran,” said deputy spokesman for the UN Secretary-General Farhan Haq.\n\n“We condemn all incidents that have resulted in death or serious injury, including the shooting in the city of Izeh on 16 November 2022. We are also concerned about the reported issuance of death sentences against five unnamed individuals in the context of the latest protests,” Haq said.\n\nHaq urged Iranian authorities to respect international human rights law and avoid the use of excessive force against peaceful protesters.\n\nDespite the UN’s condemnation, Iranians have been highly critical of the global organization and its agencies, saying the its words are not enough and that there is a lack of action against human rights violations taking place in Iran.\n\nStories like Parfalik’s “have led Iranians inside and outside the country to really be demanding justice asking what UNICEF is doing on the ground to stop this,” said Iranian American human rights lawyer Gissou Nia said in an interview with CNN’s Isa Soares Friday.\n\nNia, who is also director of the Strategic Litigation Project at the Atlantic Council went on to say that the UN Human Rights Council is meeting in Geneva on Thursday in a special session to address “the deteriorating human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran.”\n\n“The outcome of that special session will likely be an investigative mechanism or some kind of independent body that can collect, preserve and analyze evidence of what’s happening here for accountability purposes,” Nia said.\n\n“What would be absolutely shameful is if that 47-member body votes no” to creating such a mechanism, she added.", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian Jomana Karadsheh Hande Atay Alam", "Artemis Moshtaghian", "Jomana Karadsheh", "Hande Atay Alam"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/04/russia-ukraine-war-protests/9351061002/", "title": "Can Russian protests against war in Ukraine change anything?", "text": "By Courtney Subramanian and Anna Nemtsova\n\nMarch 4, 2022 Updated March 7, 2022, 12:00 p.m. ET\n\nWASHINGTON – Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has triggered an earthquake of global condemnation, including in his own backyard, where protests have swelled across the country in a remarkable outpouring of dissent against the Kremlin's deadly military assault.\n\nAntiwar protests erupted within hours of Russia's invasion Feb. 24 in more than 60 cities.

His ex-wife, Shelly Miles, confirmed Adams' death during a livestream on Jan. 13, weeks after Adams warned fans on a previous episode that his health was deteriorating.\n\n\"Hi, everyone. Unfortunately, this isn't good news,\" Miles said. \"Of course, he waited 'til just before the show started, but he's not with us anymore.\"\n\nMiles read a final letter written by Adams, which discussed his dedication to his religion and said, in part, \"If you are reading this, things did not go well for me. I have a few things to say before I go. My body failed before my brain.\"\n\nHere's what we know about Scott Adams, including his cause of death and who his family was.\n\nWho was Scott Adams?\n\nScott Adams was an American cartoonist, commentator and author best known for creating the popular \"Dilbert\" comic strip. At its height, the satirical series was circulated in thousands of newspapers, earning a TV spinoff and accolades.\n\nAdams wrote several books on religion and later became a political and social commentator, using his podcast \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams\" and other online platforms to continue creating content after a controversy wiped his comic strips from mainstream media sources.\n\nHow old was Scott Adams?\n\nScott Adams was 68 at the time of his death.\n\nAdams was born on June 8, 1957, in Windham, New York, to Paul and Virginia Adams, according to Britannica, bios and Adams' archived website. He graduated from Windham-Ashland-Jewett Central School in 1975 before earning a bachelor's in economics from Hartwick College and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nScott Adams' cause of death\n\nAdams shared a prostate cancer diagnosis in May, saying it had already metastasized, or spread, to his bones and other parts of his body. His health continued to deteriorate as the cancer spread to his spine and paralyzed him in the last months of his life.\n\nIn a New Year's episode of his podcast, he announced that his cancer had progressed to a point where his chances of recovery were \"essentially zero\" and told his fans to prepare for his death.\n\nScott Adams' family\n\nAdams was married to his first wife, Shelly Miles, from 2006 to 2014. The two remained friends after separating, living near each other and sometimes working together on his podcast.\n\nIn 2020, he married his second wife, Kristina Basham, the vice president of WhenHub. The two divorced in 2022.\n\nHe did not have any children but was a stepfather to Miles' two children, Savannah and Justin. Basham also had two children at the time she married Adams.\n\nScott Adams' career, controversy\n\nAdams worked a few corporate jobs early in his career, which provided him with fodder for his later work satirizing office life. After several publications rejected him, Adams launched his comic strip \"Dilbert\" with United Media in 1989.\n\nOver the next decade, the observational comedy cartoon would earn Adams acclaim, with the illustrator receiving the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award in 1997. By 2013, the series was featured in 2,000 newspapers in 65 countries and translated into 25 languages, as reported by USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, the pop cultural legacy of \"Dilbert\" screeched to a halt in 2023 after numerous newspapers, including the USA TODAY Network, announced they would stop running the strip due to racist comments made by Adams, who said that white people should \"get the hell away from Black people.\" Adams said at the time that his remarks were meant to be hyperbolic.\n\nAdams leaned into political commentary later in life, with his podcast and YouTube channel, supporting President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, making predictions and promoting right-wing talking points and ideologies. He garnered more pushback for several other controversial comments over the years, including anti-vaccine and anti-masking rhetoric, claiming he was discriminated against as a white man, making disparaging comments against women and questioning the number of people who died in the Holocaust.\n\n\"Dilbert\" was later relaunched as a webcomic on Locals under the name \"Daily Dilbert Reborn\" after it was dropped from newspapers.\n\nBesides the Reuben Award, Adams also received the Orwell Award in 1998 for his participation in the satire series \"Mission Impertinent\" for the San Jose Mercury News West Magazine. He was also listed on the Thinkers50 Ranking of the 50 most influential management thinkers in 2001, 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nContributing: Edward Segarra, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2026/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2026/01/02/dilbert-cartoonist-scott-adams-cancer-update/87992710007/", "title": "'Dilbert' cartoonist Scott Adams shares dire health update amid cancer", "text": "Jan. 2, 2026, 11:38 a.m. ET\n\nScott Adams, the cartoonist behind the popular strip \"Dilbert,\" is sharing a critical update on his battle with cancer.\n\nAdams, 68, shared in May that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.

The Jackson Fire Department responded and was able to contain and extinguish the blaze.\n\nStephen Spencer Pittman was arrested by JFD's Arson Division.

Sacred Torahs destroyed. We are thankful no one was injured, but this wasn't random vandalism — it was a deliberate, targeted attack on the Jewish community,\" Greenblatt said in a statement. “Beth Israel survived a KKK bombing in 1967. That it has been attacked again, amid a surge of antisemitic incidents across the US, is a stark reminder: antisemitic violence is escalating, and it demands total condemnation and swift action from everyone — including community leaders, law enforcement, and government officials We stand with Beth Israel and Jackson's Jewish community. An attack on any synagogue is an attack on all Jews. We will not be intimidated.

Press & Sun Bulletin\n\nDec. 6, 2016, 8:05 p.m. ET\n\nBINGHAMTON, N.Y. — An Endicott firefighter is accused of setting an \"obstacle course\" of gasoline-filled cans inside his home while his wife and two teenagers slept Aug. 10, prosecutors say, then starting a fire.\n\nWhile the house at 410 E. Main St. filled with smoke and as emergency responders rushed to the scene around 2 a.m., 41-year-old firefighter Jason T. Stokes and his family escaped unhurt, according to Broome County District Attorney Steve Cornwell. Gas cans and containers with flammable materials — alleged booby traps for firefighters — were found while searching inside after quickly extinguishing the flames, he said.\n\nCoupling the suspicious fire was the anti-police message, \"Lie with pigs, fry like bacon,\" that Stokes allegedly spray-painted on an outside wall of his residence, according to Cornwell, who called it a ruse to drum up suspicion toward nationwide sentiments that were making headlines at the time.\n\nFirefighter set fire to his own home, police say\n\nDuring Tuesday news conference, Cornwell described a disturbing crime scene, as he announced the indictment of Stokes on a felony count of second-degree arson.\n\nStokes pleaded not guilty and Broome County Judge Kevin Dooley ordered him jailed on $10,000 bail, with a trial tentatively set for April 17.\n\nAcknowledging the scandalous nature of the allegations in this case, Cornwell said Tuesday his office would pursue it no differently than any other prosecution by holding itself to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\"Arson cases ... contain a lot of evidence,\" Cornwell said Tuesday. \"Obviously, it's beyond disappointing when members of the public service sector don't follow through with their promise.\"\n\nFirefighters who entered Stokes' house first made sure everyone had gotten out, Cornwell said, then a senior fire investigator identified a gas can from the kitchen and brought it outside for safety.\n\nAdditional bottles with a flammable substance and gas cans were located elsewhere in the home, according to Cornwell, and investigators traced the fire's origin to the basement.\n\nDuring Tuesday's news conference, Cornwell declined to repeat the alleged \"Lie with pigs, fry like bacon\" statement, calling it \"absolutely despicable.\"\n\n\"It fuels this false narrative of what's going on this country when it comes to the work that police officers do,\" Cornwell said. \"It's a despicable display of how law enforcement should be viewed in society today and it's completely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe district attorney would not release a motive in the crime or how specifically the Endicott fire started.\n\nAccording to Endicott village records, Stokes was hired in the fire department March 14, 2005, and at the time paid an hourly rate of $13.83, or $28,766.40 annually. His most latest pay rate at the fire department is $27.68 per hour, according to records.\n\nVillage officials say Stokes has been placed on administrative leave as a result of the criminal charge.\n\nThe arson case was presented to the Broome County grand jury Thursday, Cornwell said, and a warrant was issued for Stokes' arrest after the panel voted to charge him.\n\nStokes was taken into custody late Thursday by state police, culminating their five-month investigation into the fire. If convicted of the arson charge, he could be sentenced to a maximum of 25 years in state prison.\n\nCornwell confirmed Tuesday the alleged arson scenario at 410 E. Main St. bears similarities to another suspicious Endicott fire: A Sept. 4, 2015 incident inside a former synagogue, at 117 Jefferson Ave., which is a Broome County-owned property just a block from the Endicott fire station.\n\nPolice say an elaborate setup of accelerants and trip wires were discovered inside the building by responding village firefighters. No arrests have been made in connection with that fire, though police have called it an arson.\n\n\"We will continue to investigate that case and we expect to have an announcement, one way or another,\" Cornwell said Tuesday.\n\nFollow Anthony Borelli on Twitter: @PSBABorrelli", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/communities/santa-paula/2018/10/30/southern-california-edison-sce-says-equipment-involved-thomas-fire/1823761002/", "title": "Southern California Edison says equipment involved in Thomas Fire", "text": "Updated Oct. 30, 2018, 8:08 p.m. ET\n\nSouthern California Edison said Tuesday it believes its electrical equipment was associated with one of two ignition points of the Thomas Fire, according to a statement from the company.\n\nWhile dozens of lawsuits claimed the utility company’s equipment sparked the blaze, Tuesday was the first time Edison acknowledged its ties to the fire that ripped through Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and burned nearly 282,000 acres.\n\nThe Rosemead-based company’s release of the information came as an update to investors but was released publicly to keep communities and customers informed, according to Edison.\n\nThomas Fire coverage:\n\nIn the third-quarter 2018 earnings call to investors, Edison International CEO Pedro Pizarro explained that the utility has been reviewing the cause of the blaze separately from the official investigation by the Ventura County Fire Department and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. An official cause has yet to be determined by the fire agencies .\n\n“Based on the progress of our ongoing work in these areas with the information currently available to us, we believe that the Thomas Fire which developed in Ventura County in early December 2017 had at least two separate ignition points. With respect to one of these ignition points, Koenigstein Road, SCE believes that its equipment was associated with this ignition,” Pizarro said during the call.\n\nThere was a separate ignition point that Edison identified as near Anlauf Canyon, north of Steckel Park near Santa Paula, but the company has not been able to determine whether its equipment was involved. Pizarro said the utility has not been granted access to that area. However, fire investigators have removed Edison equipment from both locations.\n\nThe announcement came a little over five weeks after Gov. Jerry Brown approved legislation allowing utilities to bill customers to pay for future legal settlements due to 2017 wildfires.\n\nVentura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen would not comment Tuesday on Edison’s announcement.\n\n“I’m not going to have a comment until we come out with Cal Fire and the formal report,” Lorenzen said.\n\nIt’s unknown when the report will be released. Lorenzen said the report is being reviewed at the state level, which is normal in the investigation process because the findings could be “pretty consequential.”\n\nBut it’s not typical for the investigation to take this long, Lorenzen said, “however this was not a normal fire.”\n\nOfficials in Ventura, where much of the fire damage was reported, were surprised by the statement.\n\n“I appreciate their candor in admitting their involvement but there are great lawyers to make sure they (homeowners) recover their losses,” said Ventura Deputy Mayor Matt LaVere.\n\nThe city of Ventura is also suing Edison over its alleged role in the Thomas Fire. The city is also facing its own litigation for damage caused by the fire.\n\nThe Thomas Fire was reported on the evening of Dec. 4, 2017, with firefighters responding to an area near Thomas Aquinas College in the Santa Paula area. Another report of a fire came in later in the area of Koenigstein Road in the Ojai Valley area, fire officials said.\n\nAmid record Santa Ana winds, the two blazes grew rapidly and merged into one fire, racing to Ventura and ultimately spreading to Santa Barbara County. It destroyed more than 1,000 structures, many of them in Ventura, fire officials said.\n\nThe fire claimed the life of a Cal Fire engineer and a Santa Paula woman as it reigned as the state’s largest ever recorded wildfire, a title held until the Mendocino Complex Fire broke out in July.\n\nIn numerous lawsuits filed in Ventura, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties hundreds of plaintiffs have alleged negligence on Edison’s part in maintaining their equipment, thus leading to the blaze.\n\nEdison was also sued by those affected by a deadly mud and debris flow in Montecito that destroyed more than 100 homes and killed 21 people. Plaintiffs alleged a rainstorm triggered on the fire-charred hills above the community led to the disaster.\n\nThe Thomas Fire and mudslide cases were all coordinated and sent to Los Angeles County, where they were to be handled together. A master complaint alleges electrical equipment at the top of Koenigstein Road “arced thereby igniting the second ignition point.”\n\nAlexander Robertson, a Westlake Village-based attorney, is part of a group of local lawyers representing victims of both events. In a statement Tuesday, he said the group welcomed Edison’s “admission.”\n\n“Since December of last year, we began filing lawsuits against SCE on behalf of residents of Upper Ojai who lost their homes and ranches due to SCE’s faulty equipment. Many of our clients saw a transformer explode on top of a power pole in the front yard of a home located at the top of Koenigstein Road,” Robertson said in an email to The Star.\n\nMore local news:\n\nThe attorney said the group is confident that Edison is also responsible for the first ignition point, as alleged in the complaint. He called on the utility to also take responsibility in that location so all parties can “move towards resolving the claims of thousands of victims, many of whom remain homeless due to this catastrophic tragedy.”\n\nRichard Atmore, a rancher and one of the plaintiffs in a case against the utility, said he appreciated the admission but found the timing to be too late.\n\n“I think their admission is long overdue. It’s something we’ve known for a while and now that they said it we can all move forward,” Atmore said.\n\nPizarro said in the investor phone call that the utility also expects material losses in connection with the Thomas Fire but said, “we are currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of losses that may be incurred.”\n\nA new law signed by the governor this year addresses the lawsuits filed in connection with a series of major wildfires reported in 2017.\n\nAccording to news reports, the law creates a special process for the 2017 fires and seeks to determine how much liability a utility can absorb without facing bankruptcy or other severe problems. From there, it’s possible for additional costs to be billed to consumers.\n\nFor future fires, the law allows the California Public Utilities Commission to consider factors like weather conditions, a utility’s fire-prevention efforts and mismanagement, to decide whether utilities can pass along costs to customers.\n\nThe law also mandates investor-owned utilities to make changes to equipment so it’s less likely to cause fires. The law makes it easier to conduct prescribed burns, clear dead vegetation and build fire breaks, and includes $1 billion over five years to help pay for these measures.\n\nStaff writer Jeremy Childs contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2026/01/12/mississippi-synagogue-beth-israel-jackson-ms-arson-fire-suspect-identified/88146645007/", "title": "Mississippi synagogue Beth Israel congregation fire suspect identified", "text": "Updated Jan. 12, 2026, 5:39 p.m. ET\n\nAI-assisted summary A suspect was arrested in connection with an arson fire at the Beth Israel Congregation synagogue in Mississippi.\n\nStephen Spencer Pittman was charged with maliciously damaging a building by means of fire.\n\nThe suspect confessed to lighting the fire due to the building's Jewish ties, according to an affidavit.\n\nNo one was injured in the blaze, which was contained by the Jackson Fire Department.\n\nA suspect was identified in connection with the arson fire at the Beth Israel Congregation synagogue in Mississippi, according to an affidavit filed Monday, Jan. 12, in U.S. Southern District Court of Mississippi.\n\nThe affidavit states Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, was charged with maliciously damaging or destroying a building by means of fire or an explosive.

Moments later, footage revealed the orange glow of a fire.\n\nWithin a couple of days, the court documents say, Sechriest scribbled again in his journal: “I set a synagogue on fire. … Get worried when it mentions they are ‘hopeful’ a suspect will be caught.”\n\nThe entries fell in a to-do list that also included surfing the dating app Tinder, doing laundry and meditating.\n\nSechriest, a member of the 6th Brigade of the Texas State Guard and a Texas State University student, now faces a federal arson charge related to the fire — he already was facing an arson charge in state court — and an affidavit made public Monday described the case against him in more detail.\n\nIt included photographs of racist and antisemitic entries from his journal and other evidence officials say link him to the fire.\n\nThe fire was among several alarming incidents in Austin in recent weeks that raised fears about an ongoing attack on the Jewish community. The affidavit in Sechriest’s case makes no mention of any larger, coordinated effort in which he is suspected of being involved, but officials say investigations into the incidents are ongoing.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people attended a rally at the Capitol for kindness to counter the hate-driven incidents, which also have included antisemitic graffiti at Anderson High School and a group that twice hung offensive banners from a MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) overpass.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Sechriest also wrote, “return to base,” under his entry about finding a target, but it is unclear whether he was in Austin that day or was referring to his Guard duties.\n\nThe Texas State Guard, part of the Texas Military Department, provides in-state service for emergency and disaster response and border security, among other things. The Guard said in a statement that it is cooperating with the investigation and “will not tolerate misconduct.”\n\nInvestigators with the FBI and Austin Fire Department wrote that they first linked Sechriest to the fire using security video that showed his license plate. Then they searched his home and SUV.\n\nOn Sept. 6, he bought a green 5-gallon racing fuel utility jug, according to a receipt in his car, and agents wrote that they also found three 32-ounce bottles of lighter fluid and matches in his car. The affidavit said the fuel container is similar to the one the suspect was seen on security video using.\n\n“Based on my training and experience, and that of other agents knowledgeable about explosive devices, these items are consistent with materials that can be used and combined to produce destructive devices known as Molotov cocktails,” FBI agent Thomas P. Joy Jr. wrote.\n\nThey also found stickers in Sechriest's car, including one that said: “They hate your ancestors. … They hate your culture. … They hate your nation. … They hate your religion. … It is okay to hate them back.” Another said: “No invader is innocent.”\n\nIn a search of his home, officials wrote that they found Sechriest’s journal and a 2021 planning calendar. Using a racial slur, he wrote on Aug. 19 that he had to take a “n----- appreciation class” the day after Texas State orientation, a picture of his calendar entry showed.\n\nFire Department investigators determined that the blaze caused at least $25,000 in damage — synagogue officials said Monday it is closer to $150,000 — and could have destroyed the building on Shoal Creek Boulevard.\n\nSechriest remained in federal custody Monday; a bail hearing on the federal arson charge had not yet been set. He was transferred to federal custody from Travis County jail Monday after being held in lieu of $100,000 bail on a local arson charge.\n\nUnder Texas law, Sechriest faces up to life in prison if convicted of the first-degree felony. He faces up to 20 years behind bars if convicted of the federal charge. Prosecutors might enhance his punishment by charging him with a hate crime.\n\nCongregation Beth Israel Senior Rabbi Steve Folberg, who spoke at Sunday’s rally at the Capitol, said in a statement: “We denounce all acts of bigotry and violence, especially those motivated by blind hatred of any of the proud and distinctive communities that enrich our civic life.

He received five years in 2018 and three years in 2019.\n\nClemmer had been receiving treatment at the prison hospital for a terminal disease.\n\nHe was pronounced dead around 1:11 p.m. by the on-duty physician at the prison.\n\nMDOC said in a news release that no foul play is suspected in either man's death. An autopsy will determine the official cause and the manner of their deaths.\n\nThe deaths mark the 23rd and 24th state inmates to die in custody since Dec. 29, when an eruption of deadly violence at Mississippi prisons began and lasted for nearly a week had turned the national spotlight on the state's long-troubled prison system, renewing calls for reform.\n\nOn Monday, 68-year-old Patricia Wilhite died at Baptist Medical Center in Jackson. She was an inmate at Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County. No foul play is suspected in her death, but the official cause will be determined by an autopsy.\n\nPrison violence and squalid living conditions have prompted investigations by the state and federal governments and protests from activist groups and celebrities like Jay Z and Yo Gotti.\n\nHard time, brutal conditions: A history of Parchman prison\n\nMississippi prison crisis: Inmate escapes work center in Harrison County but is recaptured hours later\n\nWhile some of the recent deaths have been attributed to fights and gang-related activities, others have been ruled suicides or from natural causes.\n\nThe number of deaths within the last two months are more than double the average for MDOC. Records obtained by the Clarion Ledger show that between January 2014 and September 2019, an average of 5.5 people died while in custody per month.\n\nThere also haven't been this many homicides and suicides per month since at least 2014. According to MDOC's records, the vast majority of past inmate deaths have been attributed to natural causes.\n\nContact Lici Beveridge at 601-584-3104 or lbeveridge@gannett.com.

Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia said in the release. “Our laws regarding the dispensing of opioids and other controlled substances are clear and apply to everyone. We will pursue whatever legal action is necessary to stop any enterprise, regardless of size, that places profit over the safety of our citizens.”\n\nDOJ: 'CVS' actions helped to fuel the opioid crisis'\n\nBy CVS allegedly ignoring evidence and violating both the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and False Claims Act (FCA), the pharmacy reached corporate-mandated performance metrics, received incentive compensation and abided by staffing policies that \"prioritized corporate profits over patient safety,\" the Justice Department said.\n\nCVS's staffing levels were far too low for pharmacists to meet their performance metrics and comply with their legal responsibilities, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The pharmacy also \"deprived its pharmacists of crucial information,\" including not warning them about certain prescribers.\n\n\"The complaint alleges that CVS’ actions helped to fuel the opioid crisis and that, in some particularly tragic instances, patients died after overdosing on opioids shortly after filling unlawful prescriptions at CVS,\" the Justice Department release reads.\n\nWhistleblower brought allegations against CVS to light\n\nThe Justice Department called Hillary Estright, a former CVS employee, a whistleblower after she filed an action on Oct. 17, 2019, alleging misconduct by the pharmacy. She filed under the qui tam provisions of the FCA, which authorizes private parties to sue on behalf of the U.S. for false claims and share in any recovery, the Justice Department said.\n\nThe FCA also allows the U.S. to intervene and take over lawsuits filed under qui tam provisions, which is what it has done in this case.\n\n'Unlawful' prescriptions were for an FDA-approved opioid medication, CVS says\n\nAccording to CVS' statement, the pharmacy said the government's lawsuit is seeking to \"impose a shifting standard for pharmacy practice.\"\n\n\"Many of the litigation theories laid out in the complaint are not found in any statute or regulation, and relate to topics on which the government has declined to provide guidance,\" the statement reads.\n\nCVS also said the prescriptions that the Justice Department is calling \"unlawful\" were for an FDA-approved opioid medication prescribed by a practitioner who \"the government itself licensed, authorized, and empowered to write controlled-substance prescriptions,\" according to the statement.\n\nAccording to the statement, CVS Health created a \"first-of-its-kind program to block controlled-substance prescriptions written by doctors of potential concern\" 12 years ago. To date, the pharmacy has blocked more than 1,250 practitioners, including 600 prescribers who the government continues to license, the statement says.\n\n\"This program is not required by any statute or regulation, and CVS Health repeatedly has defended lawsuits from those alleging we go too far in blocking opioid prescribers.\" according to CVS. \"The government’s lawsuit intensifies a serious dilemma for pharmacists, who are simultaneously second-guessed for dispensing too many opioids, and too few.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/30/stockton-california-shooting-wtk/87537366007/", "title": "Stockton, California shooting kills 4, injures 11.

Stockton is city in California’s Central Valley, located about 50 miles south of Sacramento.\n\nThe sheriff's office confirmed on Nov. 30 that a total of 15 people sustained gunshot wounds during the shooting. Heather Brent, a spokesperson for the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office, said three children – ages 8, 9 and 14 – and a 21-year-old were killed in the shooting.\n\nThe shooting left 11 others injured and several, including children and adults, were taken to local hospitals, according to Brent. Withrow said at least one person remained in critical condition.\n\nHere’s what we know so far.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAs of 11 a.m. PT on Nov. 30, the sheriff’s office said during a news conference it had limited information about the shooting.\n\nPolice received reports of gunfire at the banquet hall shortly before 6 p.m. Nov. 29. It occurred at a shopping mall complex that includes a Dairy Queen, a donut shop and an Asian restaurant.\n\n\"They were coming together as a family, having a time to enjoy,\" Brent said.\n\nWithrow said during the Nov. 30 news conference that it appeared the shooting began indoors before moving outdoors. The sheriff added that investigators have finished processing the scene and were looking through the evidence.\n\nMultiple vehicles were towed from the scene, including some that had bullet holes, according to Withrow. He also said \"some firearms\" were discovered on the roof of the building but investigators have not confirmed whether they were connected to the shooting.\n\nA Modesto Sutter Health Memorial spokesperson confirmed to The Stockton Record, part of the USA TODAY Network, that there are three adult patients at their hospital. All three are in \"stable condition,\" according to the spokesperson.\n\nSan Joaquin District Attorney Ron Frietas said at a Nov. 29 news conference, shortly after the incident, that the suspect was still at large. Officials asked anyone with information to contact the sheriff’s office.\n\nThe sheriff said investigators are reviewing witness statements and are asking the public to share any video of the incident that may help in the investigation.\n\nSan Joaquin County sheriff says shooting was 'not a random act'\n\nEarly indications suggest the shooting may have been a \"targeted incident,\" according to Brent. Withrow reiterated that investigators are still pursuing all possible leads and searching for a possible suspect or suspects involved in the shooting.\n\n\"We're going to say that we're confident that this was not a random act,\" Withrow said at the Nov. 30 news conference. \"They walked into this area and was probably looking for somebody in particular. Why they did that, what they're part of, who they are — we don't know.\"\n\nStockton mayor announces $25,000 reward\n\nOn Nov. 30, Stockton Mayor Christina Fugazi announced that a $25,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the arrest of the suspected shooter or shooters.\n\n\"Crimestoppers is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved,\" Fugazi said in a social media post. \"I am matching that with another $10,000, and with a $5,000 contribution from Councilwoman Mariela Ponce. The total bounty now stands at $25,000.\"\n\nThe mayor also gave a warning to anyone who may be assisting the suspect or withholding information from investigators.\n\n\"Let me be very clear to anyone who hides, shields, or harbors these terrorists,\" Fugazi said. \"You are putting yourself at risk of having your door kicked in, your home raided, and being arrested for aiding and abetting. If you protect them, you become part of this. And you will face the consequences.\"\n\nCommunity members attend prayer vigil to honor victims\n\nFaith in the Valley, a faith-based community organization in California’s Central Valley, held a prayer vigil at 3 p.m. PT on Nov. 30 to honor the victims in the shooting. The event was held a few streets away at Victoria Square on Thornton Road, near the site of the shooting.\n\nMore than 150 people, including state and local leaders, were in attendance. Many held red or white roses in their hands while others held candles.\n\nSeveral religious leaders took turns at the podium praying and remembering those killed or injured in the shooting. The clergy’s calls to actions were all similar: stop the violence and report what you see.\n\n“If you use your voice, it’s not snitching,\" said Pastor Pamela Houston of God’s Church City of David. She said no family deserved to endure such trauma, loss or senseless violence.\n\nStockton Vice Mayor Jason Lee said parents brought their children to the party and those kids left with the medical examiners. He said he spoke with a woman who brought her niece and nephew, and both of the children were killed.\n\n\"That trauma lives on forever and this community is dealing with a lot of trauma,\" Lee said.\n\nHow have officials responded?\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office issued a statement on social media hours after the shooting, calling it a \"horrific\" incident. The governor said he was monitoring the situation and coordinating with local officials.\n\nStockton has a population of about 320,000, according to the latest Census data. It has one of the highest rates of violent crime of all municipalities in California. In 2024, there were 51 homicides in Stockton, according to data collected by the California Attorney General's Office.\n\nFugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\" during a news conference.\n\n\"This is Thanksgiving weekend. This is when families come together, celebrate, share memories, and give each other love,\" she said. \"Unfortunately tonight, heaven is a little bigger with the individuals, children and adults that unfortunately did not make it.\"\n\nIn a statement on behalf of the San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors, Supervisor Paul Canepa said he was \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the shooting.\n\n\"On behalf of the entire Board of Supervisors, I want to extend our heartfelt condolences to the victims and their families,\" Canepa said. \"We stand united in our commitment to seek justice, and we have full confidence in our Sheriff’s Office and District Attorney as they work to identify and prosecute those responsible for this senseless act of violence.\"\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nContributing: Sheyanne N.

Djokovic, the world’s No. 1 player, already has won the tournament in Melbourne five times in his career, and he holds three Wimbledon and two U.S Open titles. Murray will be a familiar face; it's the Brit’s fifth final in Australia. He has lost the previous four, including three times to Djokovic. In the women’s Australian Open final on Saturday, Serena Williams was foiled in her pursuit of her 22nd career grand slam, which would've tied her with Steffi Graf for most major titles in the Open era. Williams lost to Angelique Kerber Saturday.\n\nSAG Awards could hint at Oscars winners\n\nThe 22nd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards are being held on Saturday in Los Angeles, honoring the best performances on the big and small screens in 2015. It's the only award show where the votes are only cast by actors themselves. The SAGs are one more step in the journey to the Academy Awards, and the winners may tell us a little something about who will win in February, because actors are the largest voting branch of the Academy. The show starts at 8 p.m. ET on TNT and TBS, and USA TODAY’s reporters will be live on the red carpet.

Then flip to the NFL Pro Bowl at 7 p.m. ET, played in Hawaii’s Aloha Stadium. This year’s game pits two Hall of Famers — winning 2014 Pro Bowl captain Jerry Rice and winning 2015 Pro Bowl captain Michael Irvin — against one another in a Team Irvin vs. Team Rice showdown.\n\nSyria peace talks set for Sunday\n\nThe main Syrian opposition group agreed to join long-awaited peace talks, now set for Sunday. The talks were supposed to begin earlier this week, but were postponed twice. Steffan de Mistura, the United Nation's coordinator for the talks, said he has \"good reason to believe\" that the opposition group will show up. If the talks take place, the meeting would be the third time members of Syria’s many opposition groups meet with representatives of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government to discuss how to end a civil war that has lasted nearly five years, resulted in 300,000 deaths and displaced half of the country's pre-war population of 22 million.\n\nWho'll win Sundance?\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival awards go out Saturday night. Some of the most buzzworthy movies to keep an eye on heading into the ceremony: The Birth of a Nation, about Nat Turner's 1831 slave rebellion, is already garnering 2017 Oscar talk. Sing Street, about a teen who starts a band to win a girl, was \"probably the biggest crowd-pleaser at the festival.\" And Manchester by the Sea reunites Matt Damon (as producer) and Affleck (Casey, not Ben).Manchester already made news, as Amazon scooped it up for $10 million.

Experts stress that a child's age and interests should come before gender.\n\nThe debate over gender-specific toys was stirred again recently after toymaker Hasbro said it will start selling its classic Easy-Bake oven in gender-neutral colors. The oven will debut Feb. 10-13 at the New York Toy Fair; it will be in stores in the fall.\n\nHasbro's announcement followed news stories about McKenna Pope, a 13-year-old girl from Garfield, N.J., who started a petition asking the toymaker to redesign the oven in other colors. She found it only in pink and purple, but wanted to buy it for her 4-year-old brother for Christmas.\n\n\"We value input from our consumers, and given the widespread interest in McKenna Pope's story, we extended an invitation to McKenna and her family to visit Hasbro,\" the company said in a statement. \"During her visit we showed her a new black and silver EASY-BAKE Oven design that has been in development over the past 18 months.\"\n\nResearchers agree with Pope that toys should be inclusive of boys and girls.\n\nEmily W. Kane, a sociology professor at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, says playing with a wide range of toys can cultivate different capacities in children, such as developing nurturing by playing with dolls.\n\nPlay also can contribute to the development of practical skills. For example, Kane says, little kitchen centers and plastic vacuum cleaners can help children learn domestic skills such as cooking and cleaning.\n\nKane adds that it is easier for girls to play with toys considered traditionally for boys than for boys to play with toys targeted to girls.\n\n\"Boys really face strong pressure from peers if they do things considered stereotypically feminine,\" she says. The boys could get teased or bullied, she adds.\n\nKane says her ideal toy store would be organized by theme. \"I would love to see something in which colors varied within aisles,\" she adds. \"That would make a difference for kids wandering up and down the aisles.\"\n\nPeggy Orenstein, author of Cinderella Ate My Daughter, agrees that marketing certain toys to only girls or just boys discourages children from experiencing the whole range of potential playthings. It also prevents them from exploring a range of behaviors, she adds.\n\n\"There is a much greater division between boys and girls right at the time when more than ever they're going to be playing and working together,\" says Orenstein, a writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nAdrienne Appell, a spokeswoman for the Toy Industry Association, with headquarters in New York, says, \"The perfect toy is one that matches age and interest.\" She adds, \"The age is heavily based on a safety perspective.\"\n\nSusan Linn, director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, based in Boston, says, \"A good toy is 90% child and 10% toy. A good toy just lies there until a child invests it with life and/or meaning. A toy that is 90% child encourages play that is driven by a child's interests, needs and experiences.\n\n\"You know it's a good toy when different children do different things with it and it can be used lots of different ways,\" says Linn, the author of The Case for Make Believe: Saving Play in a Commercialized World.\n\nShe says it is important for parents to be thoughtful about which toys they give to their children because they are passing on their beliefs, biases and values in doing so. For example, she says, \"When we give them dolls, we are telling them that this is what we think people should look like.\"\n\nLinn adds, \"Children learn from everything.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2022/07/19/toys-r-us-macys-stores/10094231002/", "title": "Toys R Us is back?

Not that there is anything wrong with that.\n\nMichigan State’s senior quarterback was in a own zone Saturday night, hitting receivers downfield and making plays on rollouts. There was no need to worry about which offensive linemen were in front of him.\n\nBecause they, too, were locked in.\n\nThat also got the rest of the offense moving and producing, just four days after being called out by coach Mark Dantonio.\n\n“I think it pissed a lot of them off, and I think it was good that they got that challenge,” said Lewerke, who threw for 314 yards and three TDs without being sacked. “But there are guys today that said it felt really good to hit a guy in the mouth and bring the hitting to them.”\n\nMSU went with a consistent group in the first three possessions: Kevin Jarvis at left tackle, Luke Campbell at left guard, Matt Allen at center, Matt Carrick at right guard and Jordan Reid at right tackle. That unit produced three straight touchdown drives to open the game en route to the 19th-ranked Spartans’ 51-17 blowout of Western Michigan.\n\n“Zero sacks,” Dantonio said pointedly Sunday night on his weekly teleconference. “You don’t have sacks, no penalties and a lot of explosive plays, good things are gonna happen.”\n\nWHAT'S LOOMING: Michigan State's Mark Dantonio worried about a win, not a record this week\n\nIt was a quick-strike, no-huddle approach most of the way. MSU (2-0) needed just 18 plays for the scores, going 79 yards on four plays to open the game and following that with a nine-play, 69-yard march and a five-play, 80-yard TD drive before coaches started working in other linemen.\n\nThe Spartans produced 582 total yards, including 251 rushing. That came eight days after posting just 303 overall yards, 108 on the ground and just one touchdown in a 28-7 season-opening win over Tulsa, which prompted Dantonio to demand more toughness and precision at the point of attack from his line.\n\n“This was big for us,” Lewerke said. “I think we definitely needed this on the offensive side. It puts confidence in the whole team.”\n\nAnd it began with two explosive plays — a 33-yard Lewerke-to-Darrell Stewart pass on the first snap, then a 29-yard run around right end from new starting running back Elijah Collins. Lewerke hit tight end Matt Dotson for a 2-yard TD pass to cap the first score.\n\n“It was a major confidence-booster,” Reid said Saturday. “Just like (against Tulsa), our first drive was real explosive and ended in a touchdown. We came out this week with the same type of mentality. … We were challenged, and we completed the challenge today.”\n\nSenior Tyler Higby — who started all 13 games last season at center, left tackle and left guard — worked in at right guard as a backup. Blake Bueter saw time at both right guard and center in the first half as MSU got 365 yards and posted 31 points in the first half. Bueter was at center and Higby at right guard for the Spartans’ fourth TD in the second quarter.\n\nNEXT UP: Three things we're watching against Arizona State\n\n“I think it’s always collective,” Dantonio said. \"The tight ends are always involved in this, play-calling is involved in this. Certainly, you gotta get on your guys from an offensive line standpoint, and then you gotta see and have vision in terms of where you’re going with the ball sometimes. So it’s all-inclusive, pretty much like I’d said last week, it was all-inclusive in the opposite direction.\n\n“Again, what we need to get is consistency in our performance, and I think we’ll get that. Western Michigan had nine starters back on defense, they do a lot of movement, a lot of pressure, a lot of blitzing. So for us to be able to do what we did in that type of fashion was a big positive.”\n\nBuilding a big lead allowed MSU to work in some of its younger linemen in the second half, including projected left tackle starter A.J. Arcuri, who missed the opener with an ankle injury. Highly touted freshmen Devontae Dobbs and Nick Samac got their first exposure to college football, and redshirt freshman Mustafa Khaleefah also saw time late and were part of the Spartans’ sixth and final TD run from Alante Thomas.\n\n“We got what we asked for — we got a lot of effort, a great effort,” Dantonio said. “And we got great toughness. They came to play with enthusiasm. And we focused on the moment, which was sort of the theme.”\n\nHayes plays\n\nSophomore Jalen Nailor, the Spartans’ third starting wide receiver alongside senior Darrell Stewart and junior Cody White, is out indefinitely with a right foot injury. MSU turned to third-year sophomore C.J. Hayes as the No. 3 option in the passing game.\n\nHayes responded with three catches for 31 yards, including a 22-yarder on a quick in-route from Lewerke that he turned into a big play by plowing through defenders after the catch. He added a 10-yard catch on the next play from Lewerke as a safety valve on a QB option that dried up, turning it into positive yardage.\n\n“Just trying to make the most of the opportunities you got and do just basically everything you can to help the team win,” Hayes said. “There’s no secret we didn’t play that good (against Tulsa), so we tried to do everything we possibly can to not have that happen again.”\n\nStewart had a game-high 10 catches for a career-best 185 yards and a TD. White added five catches, 63 yards and a score as Lewerke went 23 of 32 through the air.\n\nNorthwestern time\n\nThe Spartans’ first road game and Big Ten opponent, at Northwestern on Sept. 21, will be a noon ET kickoff at Ryan Field in Evanston, Ill. ABC will broadcast the game.\n\nMSU has lost three in a row the past three seasons to the Wildcats and last beat them at Ryan Field in 2013 to clinch the East Division title en route to a Big Ten championship and Rose Bowl victory. The Spartans’ previous visit to Evanston was a 39-31 overtime loss in 2017.\n\nIt likely will be Lewerke’s fourth straight start against the Wildcats, against whom he made his starting debut in 2016.\n\nThe Spartans host Arizona State on Saturday (4 p.m./Fox).\n\nContact Chris Solari at csolari@freepress.com.

It will later rollout to Walmart stores nationwide in March.\n\nAutism in the spotlight\n\nThe new Barbie doll arrives as the autism community has faced extra attention in the national spotlight over controversial assertions from President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nIn September 2025, Trump and his top health aides announced that Tylenol use during pregnancy could contribute to the development of autism in children, a position many in the medical community have disagreed with for years.\n\nHealth agencies across the world and other medical experts have not found a definitive link between Tylenol and autism, though that hasn't stopped some in the autism community from championing efforts to find a cure or reason why their child is autistic.\n\nMeanwhile, portrayals of people with autism have increased in popular culture thanks to shows like \"Love on the Spectrum\" and \"The Good Doctor.\" And with the advent of the new Barbie, people with autism will now see themselves reflected in the iconic quintessential children's doll.\n\n\"It is so important for young autistic people to see authentic, joyful representations of themselves, and that’s exactly what this doll is,\" Colin Killick, executive director of ASAN, said in a statement. \"Partnering with Barbie allowed us to share insights and guidance throughout the design process to ensure the doll fully represents and celebrates the autistic community, including the tools that help us be independent.\"\n\nSee Barbie's new doll with autism\n\nAutism is not a physically visible disorder. But some people with autism may rely on certain items or types of clothing as they move through the world, which Barbie tried to reflect in the doll and its accessories.\n\nThe Barbie with autism is designed with an eye gaze shifted slightly to the side, which \"aims to reflect how some members of the autistic community may sometimes avoid direct eye contact,\" Mattel said in a release.\n\nAccording to a 2022 study in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, researchers have varying theories about why autistic people may avoid eye contact, but many studies point to hyperactivity in a part of the brain known as the amygdala.\n\nEach doll comes with the same accessories: a pink finger clip fidget spinner, pink noise-canceling headphones and a pink tablet.\n\nThe tablet shows symbol-based augmentative and alternative communication apps, which help people who have an impairment or limitation in speech, language or reading including those with autism, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.\n\nThe Barbie's outfit is a loose-fitting pinstripe A-line dress and purple Mary Jane-style flat shoes. Mattel said the dress is flowy so as to provide less fabric-to-skin contact, and the shoes promote stability.\n\nAutistic Barbie is latest in inclusive doll line\n\nThe autistic Barbie is the latest addition to the Barbie Fashionistas collection, which is aimed at being the most diverse and inclusive line of the doll. Recently, in July 2025, Mattel launched a Barbie with Type 1 diabetes.\n\nAs part of the autistic Barbie's launch, Mattel also said it is teaming up with several prominent faces in the autism community: Madison Marilla from Netflix's \"Love on the Spectrum,\" mother-daughter influencers Precious and Mikko Mirage and fashion designer Aarushi Pratap.\n\nIn statements, they all said the new autistic Barbie will allow others to feel understood.\n\n“When other families see this Barbie, I hope it helps bridge the gap.

Nyenhuis is the president and CEO of UNICEF USA. He previously served on USAID’s Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid and chaired the board of the Integral Alliance, a global network of faith-based nongovernmental organizations. Sherrie Westin is the president of Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit educational group behind “Sesame Street.” The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nSesame Workshop recently introduced Ameera, a witty, inquisitive 8-year-old girl Muppet who loves science and uses a wheelchair and forearm crutches due to a spinal cord injury.\n\nMichael J. Nyenhuis Michael J. Nyenhuis/UNICEF USA\n\nAmeera helps to represent the nearly 1 in 10 children with disabilities worldwide. Among the outpouring of messages welcoming the character, Sesame Workshop received a singularly important one of concern from UNICEF: Ameera was not using the right wheelchair for her needs.\n\nSherrie Westin Michael J. Nyenhuis/UNICEF USA\n\nAmeera can walk using crutches, meaning she has good balance and strong arms. The design of her wheelchair should be an active, compact chair with a low backrest, no armrests and tucked-in footplates. Instead, Ameera has a bulky, basic folding frame wheelchair that is not the most appropriate fit for her.\n\nThis was not news to Sesame. The creators had intentionally given Ameera a chair that would reflect the realities of children growing up in areas affected by conflict and crisis, because these children are a core part of the audience Ameera is intended to reach.\n\nThis had been a topic of debate. Should the wheelchair reflect Ameera’s reality or accurately represent her needs? Is it more powerful to show the world as it is, or how it should be?\n\nThe latest data shows more than 2.5 billion people require one or more assistive technologies such as wheelchairs or hearing aids, according to the World Health Organization-UNICEF Global Report on Assistive Technology from May 2022. It’s a figure expected to reach 3.5 billion by 2050, the report found.\n\nAccess to assistive technology is a human right and prerequisite for equal participation and opportunities, yet most people do not have sufficient access, especially in areas affected by conflict, displacement and other crises.\n\nBoth Sesame Workshop and UNICEF agreed that Ameera’s wheelchair belonged at the center of a broader discussion about how to balance representing the current reality of access to assistive technologies while advocating to change it.\n\nRepresentation is critical to ending stigma and discrimination against people with disabilities and promoting understanding and inclusion. That’s why Sesame created Ameera as a multidimensional character with her own humor, interests and bright personality that make her a natural leader among her Muppet friends. These character choices were just as intentional as the design of her wheelchair.\n\nWhile developing Ameera, Sesame and its advisers on inclusion considered the audience for the show in which she would debut, “Ahlan Simsim,” which means “Welcome Sesame” in Arabic.\n\nIt’s the award-winning local version of “Sesame Street” in the Middle East and North Africa. Through “Ahlan Simsim,” millions of children across the region have met Ameera, including children who have been displaced and those living in host communities, many of whom do not have access to appropriate assistive technology.\n\nAmeera also stars in a new library of videos designed to deliver playful learning to children affected by conflict and crisis worldwide. Many of these children have life-changing injuries and need access to affordable, appropriate assistive technology, yet these products are out of reach for the majority.\n\nAdvisers also acknowledged other realities. For example, an adviser who previously distributed wheelchairs in the Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan noted that parents often asked for larger wheelchairs because they wanted equipment their children could continue to use as they grew. Families also needed the wheelchairs to transport water or belongings.\n\nAmeera’s wheelchair therefore reflects children’s world as it is — one where too many youths have inadequate or ill-fitting assistive equipment. At the same time, Sesame and UNICEF want to advocate for the world as it should be — one in which every child with disabilities has access to affordable, appropriate assistive technology.\n\nChildren’s access to such technology often determines if they can go to school, are able to play, participate in civic life and eventually become employed. Realization of these rights is central to the lives of children and their families while also benefiting communities and societies at large.\n\nOne of UNICEF’s priorities is to work with governments and other partners to improve access to assistive technology, from directly helping children and families receive equipment to supporting countries in understanding the wider needs of citizens, refugees and other individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe recent WHO-UNICEF Global Report on Assistive Technology also offers recommendations for people-centered, multisectoral actions to improve access to assistive technology for everyone who needs it.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAs a Muppet with a physical disability, Ameera was designed to reflect children’s lived experiences. In too many cases, those experiences include the world’s failure to meet the needs of children living with disabilities.\n\nFull representation means speaking to this reality, even as we continue to work toward a day when all children with disabilities have access to the appropriate assistive technology they need to thrive.", "authors": ["Michael J.

Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n'Only 33% of sitting U.S. state judges are female'\n\n\"Barbie has had over 200 careers,\" global head of Barbie Lisa McKnight told USA TODAY. \"We like to say, 'There isn’t a plastic ceiling that Barbie hasn’t broken.' \"\n\nStill, every year, Barbie highlights a new career, especially one that is lacking female representation.\n\nThis year is Judge Barbie.\n\n\"We learned that only 33% of sitting U.S. state judges are female,\" McKnight said on Barbie's decision to introduce the judge dolls.\n\nThere are four dolls to choose from in a range of of skin tones and hairstyles and all of them wear the customary black robe and come with a gavel. Judge Barbie retails for $12.99 and is available at Barbie.com, Target, Walmart and Amazon.com.\n\n\"Our hope is that girls will enjoy playing with the dolls and imagine themselves protecting the rights of others,\" McKnight said.\n\nBut Barbie is going even further than its toys to close the \"dream gap.\"\n\nA partnership with GoFundMe\n\nA year ago, the company launched the \"Barbie Dream Gap Project\" in an effort raise awareness of the issue. Now, near the project's anniversary and Day of the Girl, Barbie is partnering with GoFundMe.org, the social fundraising site’s non-profit and advocacy arm, to raise money to support girl-empowerment programs.\n\n\"We need not only to continue to heighten awareness and consciousness about this phenomenon that is happening, but we also need to start working towards solutions to close the dream gap,\" McKnight said.\n\nThe company is encouraging donations to the Barbie Dream Gap Project Fund to help close the dream gap. The money will benefit three nonprofit organizations: She's The First, She Should Run and Step Up.\n\nThe Barbie brand is 'thriving'\n\nBarbie has made headlines in the past few years as it tries to keep up with kids' shift from analog toys to electronics.\n\nIn 2016, the company launched a Iine of dolls that come in different body shapes: tall, petite and curvy. Earlier this year, Mattel launched Sally Ride Barbie and Rosa Parks Barbie.\n\nMost recently, the company debuted a line of gender-neutral dolls.\n\nMcKnight said that the evolution has been successful.\n\n\"We have the most diverse and inclusive doll line in the world,\" she said, adding that the brand is \"thriving.\"\n\n\"We've had seven consecutive quarters of growth we are gaining market share in a very competitive environment.

The two Koreas also agreed to hold military talks aimed at easing border tensions and to re-open a key military communications hotline suspended two years ago, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.\n\nNorth Korea said it would not discuss its nuclear weapons program with the South because it was aimed only at the United States.\n\nThe announcement was made during the first meeting between the two Koreas in over two years. It was held at the border village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone that has divided the Korean Peninsula since 1953.\n\nSouth Korean Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae Sung, who relayed the news in a briefing, said Pyongyang would also send performing troupes and a taekwondo demonstration team to the Games, according to South Korean media reports.\n\nSouth Korea proposed that both sides march in together during the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games, which will be held from Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang. The last time both countries marched together under the same flag was at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n\nOlympic participation from the North would mark a return to the Winter Games after the reclusive state didn’t participate in the Sochi 2014 Games. North Korea has participated in every Summer Games since 1972, with the exception of the 1984 Los Angeles and 1988 Seoul Games, both of which it boycotted.\n\nNorth Korea has won one silver and one bronze medal in its Winter Games history.\n\nPyongyang would likely send figure skating pair Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik to the Games, who qualified after capturing a bronze medal in February 2017 at the Asian Winter Games in Japan. The International Olympic Committee has also said it would consider wild card entries for North Korean athletes.\n\nIOC president Thomas Bach released a statement Tuesday welcoming the proposals agreed upon between North and South Korea. \"These proposals mark a great step forward in the Olympic spirit,\" Bach said.\n\nThe IOC will discuss the number and names of athletes from North Korea.\n\nDuring Tuesday's talks, Seoul suggested discussing a reunion of families separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953, around the Lunar New Year's holiday in February, Vice Minister Chun told reporters.\n\nSouth Korea’s foreign ministry said Seoul may also consider temporarily lifting sanctions against North Korea if it is necessary to enable North Korean officials to attend the Games. Foreign ministry spokesman Noh Kyu Duk said the decision would be considered in close consultation with the U.S. and other relevant countries.\n\nThe inter-Korean dialogue is happening at a period of heightened tension on the peninsula, highlighted by several North Korean long-range missile launches over the past year and the isolated country’s sixth nuclear test in September.\n\nThe meeting began with warm words from the leader of the North Korean delegation, Ri Son Gwon, who is chairman of Pyongyang’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country.\n\n“I came here with hopes that the two Koreas hold talks with a sincere and faithful attitude to give precious results to the Korean people who harbor high expectations for this meeting, as the first new year present,\" he said, according to Korea’s Yonhap News Agency.\n\nSeoul’s delegation leader, Unification Minister Cho Myoung Gyon, said that the talks came after a period of long-frayed ties and that just getting started is a step in improving relations.\n\n“Well begun is half done,” he said. “I hope (the two sides) could hold the talks with determination and persistence.\"\n\nThe talks came together after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent an overture in his New Year’s Day address that the Olympics would be a “good occasion” to show the greatness of the Korean people and suggested that Pyongyang was willing to send a delegation to Games.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae has repeatedly stressed he wants the Pyeongchang Olympics to be a means for re-engagement and conflict resolution with the North.\n\n“I will strive to make the Pyeongchang Olympics the ‘Peace Olympics’ and furthermore to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue so that this can be a year when peace is cultivated on the Korean Peninsula,” Moon told a group of leaders from the Korean Senior Citizens Association at the presidential Blue House on Jan. 5.\n\nPresident Trump on Saturday expressed hope that the talks would move to issues beyond the Olympics and said that he would be willing to talk with Kim Jong Un, with whom he has engaged in a war of words over the past several months.\n\nHowever, Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Sunday that Trump’s comments didn’t indicate a change in policy.\n\n“There is no turnaround,\" Haley said. \"What he has basically said is, yes, there could be a time where we talk to North Korea, but a lot of things have to happen before that actually takes place.”\n\nThe International Olympic Committee said Monday it has \"kept the door open\" for North Korea to take part in the Games.\n\nA State Department adviser told reporters in a conference call Tuesday that while Washington viewed Tuesday’s talks as a good start, it was far too early to know if the discussions would be meaningful beyond the Olympics preparations.\n\nBrian Hook, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said the U.S. would insist on \"the complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nWin the gold!

But in the meantime, here's a quick look at what a summer without the Olympics will mean for all of the parties involved.\n\nHERCULEAN EFFORT:What does it take to move the Olympics?\n\nMOUNTING PRESSURE: How national Olympic committees pushed for decision\n\nWhat does this mean for athletes?\n\nAccording to the IOC, more than 6,000 athletes from around the world had already qualified for these Games. Thousands more were still hoping to clinch a spot in the coming months.\n\nFor many of them, this news will be devastating.\n\nThough there's been a growing sentiment among athletes in recent weeks it wouldn't be safe to hold the Tokyo Olympics as scheduled, the reality of postponement is still difficult to stomach. Remember that Olympic athletes quite literally construct their lives around the Games calendar. The daily training regimens are intense. Other endeavors, like college degrees, are often put on the backburner. It's a commitment of time and energy over a span of four years, not a few months.\n\n\"As an Olympic athlete, you live your life in (four-year) cycles,\" wrestler Jordan Burroughs said last summer. \"Everything we do is cyclical.\"\n\nNow those athletes, who had carefully crafted training programs to peak in July, must go back to the drawing board if they want to take another crack at it, likely one year from now. Some may choose not to. Bach, for example, likely would have won a second gold medal in fencing at the 1980 Games before boycotts derailed that plan. He retired shortly thereafter, at the age of 27.\n\nHow will this impact Olympic qualification?\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, about 57% of Olympic spots had been clinched, according to the IOC. Are those athletes now automatically qualified for next year's Games? Or do they have to re-earn their spots?\n\n\"In the event of postponement, I want every athlete that has earned their spot to be locked into it,\" U.S. weightlifter and Olympic qualifier Katherine Nye wrote on Twitter before Tuesday's decision had been announced. \"We have earned our spots and I don’t even want to THINK about them being taken away.\"\n\nAs for the other 43%, what does the qualification process look like moving forward? Is it as simple as rescheduling events like the larger U.S. Olympic trials in sports such as wrestling, swimming, track and field and gymnastics to this winter or next spring and calling it a day?\n\nHow will this impact the global sports calendar?\n\nThere are 33 sports that make up the Summer Olympics, which means there are 33 international sports federations that must now adapt to the new timing of the Games.\n\nIn some sports, this will be simpler than others. The track and field world championships, for example, were scheduled to take place in August of 2021. If the Games are held over the same dates, those would presumably be canceled or moved, and athletes would simply compete at the Olympics instead.\n\nWorld Athletics, the sport's international governing body, has already indicated it is open to the possibility of rescheduling its event around the Games.\n\nIn sports like soccer, however, the calendar is already plenty crowded — both with international competitions, and the schedules of major pro leagues — and rescheduling could prove daunting.\n\nThe exact meaning of moving the Games \"to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021,\" as the official statement says, remains unclear. But somewhere, a sports calendar is going to be impacted, including the NBA season if the Games were to be held in spring.\n\nWhat are the financial implications of this decision?\n\nThe IOC has insurance to guard against potential disruptions to the Games, and about $2 billion in reserve to keep itself (and its membership) afloat until its next big payday.\n\nNBC, which owns the American broadcasting rights, also has insurance. The company is in the sixth year of a $7.75 billion deal with the IOC, which will run through 2032. The IOC's top sponsors, such as P&G and Visa, also pay millions for the right to be associated with the Games.\n\nThe Japanese economy, already hurting by a drop in tourism this spring, will probably take the biggest hit, from a financial standpoint. The country spent about $28 billion to host these Games, according to the Associated Press, and it was anticipating an economic uptick in return, with spectators flying in from around the world and spending money at hotels, restaurants, etc.\n\nNow, all of that projected revenue — at least for 2020 — is gone. And some of the money the local government had already spent to host the Games this summer might be needed in 2021, to do it all over again.\n\nCould the Olympics still ultimately be canceled?\n\nIt's possible, yes.\n\nThough the IOC and Japanese government have explicitly ruled out a cancellation, there remains a chance that the logistical hurdles could prove insurmountable in the coming months.\n\nThe Olympics are one of the largest events in the world, sports or not, and as such, there are an incredible amount of moving parts involved. Venues need to be maintained. Contractors need to be re-hired. Hundreds of contracts need to be reworked.\n\nThe IOC and Japanese government are obviously confident those obstacles can be overcome, and their decision to postpone is evidence of that. But actually overcoming them is something different.\n\nWill this decision impact the 2022 Winter Games?\n\nIn all likelihood, no. The IOC has never offered any indications that the Summer Games will impact the Winter Games, which are scheduled to start in February 2022 in Beijing.\n\nThis does create an interesting situation, however, in which both the Summer and Winter Olympics will now likely be held in a span of about eight to 12 months.

I doubt this unified team would be more than a one-time event,” said Cho Ganghoon, 30, who works in the accounting department of a Seoul logistics company.\n\nKim Hee Ryeong, who works at a tourism information kiosk in Gangneung, the city which will be hosting the ice sports at the Games, complained: \"They didn’t really consider the South Korean players. They prepared for years to be in the Olympics but now they cannot play.\n\n\"As usual the (South Korean) government is too willing to be fooled by North Korea,” Kim said.\n\nWidespread negative reaction has lit up social media, with many expressing mistrust of North Korea’s motives — that it is using its Olympic participation for propaganda purposes and to ease international isolation over its development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\n\nOne Twitter user wrote that the joint hockey team is \"backstabbing all the athletes who sweat blood and everyone else who spared no effort to host the Olympics, just to use it as (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un’s propaganda.”\n\nAn online protest petition on the website of Moon's office, the Blue House, has received more than 40,000 signatures.\n\nSarah Murray, the American-born coach of the women’s hockey team, told reporters Tuesday that she had “mixed feelings” about the joint team.\n\n\"It's exciting to be a part of something that's so historic, to have two countries so divided come together through sports,\" Murray said, according to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency. \"I think the story is great and to be a part of it is important. But at the same time, it's mixed feelings because it's at the expense of, 'We don't get to play our full roster.'\"\n\nNorth Korea’s participation in the Games — including a 140-member orchestra, a 230-person cheering squad and 30-athlete taekwondo exhibition team — has been seized upon by Moon's conservative opponents.\n\nThe leader of opposition Liberty Korea Party, Hong Joon Pyo, said Monday that the Olympics were becoming the “Pyongyang Olympics,” a reference to North Korea's capital. He claimed that the administration is “attempting to put the destiny of this country and its people into the hands of Kim Jong Un.”\n\nConservative protesters met a North Korean delegation led by one of the country’s most popular singers, Hyon Song Wol, in Seoul Monday, shouting anti-Pyongyang slogans and burning an image of dictator Kim.\n\nThe appearance by Hyon, who leads the North Korean all-female group Moranbong Band, attracted breathless coverage of the type normally reserved for South Korea’s K-pop megastars.\n\nThe singer was rumored to have dated North Korean dictator Kim, and it was reported widely in South Korea in 2013 that she had been executed by a firing squad as a result of a pornography scandal. Her appearance was obsessively discussed and dissected in the news and on social media.\n\nMoon, who was elected in a landslide last year on a platform of improved ties with the North, has referred to the Pyeongchang Games as the “Peace Olympics.” He said Monday that the event has led to a “precious opportunity to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula,” where the two countries have held an uneasy truce since the end of the Korean War in 1953.\n\nDuring a visit to the national team’s hockey training facilities last week, Moon told players that the inter-Korean team at the Olympics would “make sporting history.”\n\nThe controversy around the joint team has dented Moon’s still strong popularity. In a poll released Friday by Gallup Korea, his approval dropped to 67% from 73% the week before.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/04/u-s-south-korea-agree-delay-military-exercises-during-winter-olympics/1003364001/", "title": "U.S., South Korea agree to delay military exercises during Winter ...", "text": "Updated Jan. 4, 2018, 9:24 p.m. ET\n\nAt the request of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, President Trump agreed Thursday to delay regular joint military exercises during the Winter Games in South Korea next month, the Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nThe agreement came in a phone conversation between the two leaders, according to the South Korean news agency.\n\nThe Pentagon and White House confirmed the decision to delay the annual exercises, which North Korea regular denounces as a provocation.\n\nIn a statement, the White House confirmed the leaders agreed to \"de-conflict the Olympics and our military exercises so that United States and Republic of Korea forces can focus on ensuring the security of the Games.\"\n\nUnification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun said Friday that North Korea accepted Seoul’s offer to meet in the border village next Tuesday to discuss cooperating during the Olympics and improving the two countries' ties, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Winter Olympics will be held in South Korea from Feb. 9 to Feb. 25, with the Paralympics on March 8-18.\n\nThe deal follows a slight warming in relations between South Korea and North Korea, which said it may send athletes to the games The two countries also spoke on a cross-border hotline this week for the first time in two years.\n\n\"I believe it would greatly help ensure the success of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games if you could express an intention to delay joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises during the Olympics in case the North does not make any more provocations,\" Moon was quoted as telling Trump, according to Yonhap.\n\nMoon was elected last year on a pledge to reopen a dialogue with the North and pursue better relations.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea usually hold military exercises in March and April that involve about 17,000 U.S. troops and more than 300,000 South Koreans.\n\nThe agreement comes after weeks of rising tensions over North Korea's nuclear weapons program and its testing of long-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.\n\nThis week, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un traded Twitter barbs over their nuclear programs. Trump said his \"Nuclear Button\" is \"much bigger\" and \"more powerful\" than the one Kim claimed to have on his desk.\n\nIn a New Year's Day speech, Kim boasted he had a \"nuclear button\" ready to launch weapons against the United States, and proposed negotiations with South Korea about easing military tensions and its possible participation in the upcoming Winter Games.\n\nThe prospect of North Korean athletes at the Games has stirred criticism among some Republicans in the U.S. Congress.\n\nSouth Korea looked to delay the joint exercises, known as Foal Eagle, so as not to increase tensions with North Korea when athletes from around the world converge on the Korean Peninsula to compete in the Winter Olympics.\n\nNorth Korea considers the joint exercises rehearsals for invasion and often conducts missile tests in response.\n\nThe decision to delay Foal Eagle, one of the largest war games in the world, comes after North and South Korea have expressed a new openness for high-level talks. For now, the sides say the talks would focus only on allowing North Korea to participate in the Olympics.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tweeted on Monday that allowing North Korea to participate in the Olympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet.\"\n\n\"I’m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not,\" he wrote.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/01/11/winter-olympics-lindsey-vonn-talks-challenges-of-retirement-skiing/9168451002/", "title": "Winter Olympics: Lindsey Vonn talks challenges of retirement, skiing", "text": "Jan. 11, 2022, 2:04 p.m. ET\n\nLindsey Vonn recently returned from a European vacation, skiing in France with a few family members and friends.\n\nShe said it was the first ski vacation she's had since she was 9 years old.\n\n\"It's a much different experience now,\" the Olympic gold medalist said Monday. \"I enjoy kind of going slow – I mean, maybe not as slow as I should.\"\n\nNearly three years after retiring, Vonn, 37, said she remains as competitive as ever – giving friends a head start on the mountain, for instance, and racing to catch them. She will not be competing at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, the first Games since a string of injuries ended her professional career. But she said she's enjoyed the new stage of her relationship with the sport.\n\n\"I think in a lot of ways it made it easier that my decision was kind of made for me, in the sense that my body really was telling me that that enough was enough,\" Vonn said. \"I think it would be very difficult for me to just stop on my own because I love it so much.\"\n\nOne of the most decorated U.S. female skiers in history, Vonn competed in four Winter Games and was, at one point, arguably the face of Team USA. She won three Olympic medals in her career, including a gold in downhill in Vancouver, on top of 82 victories in World Cup races. She retired in February 2019 after winning bronze in downhill at the world championships.\n\nVonn said she was \"obviously sad\" and \"a little bit resentful\" in the immediate aftermath of her retirement. She wanted to continue racing and said she would have tried to compete in Beijing if her body had held up. But in time, she's both processed those feelings and tried to spend time appreciating what she achieved in her career. Working on her new memoir, \"Rise,\" has helped.\n\n\"I think in general it was very therapeutic,\" Vonn said. \"Life is totally different once I retired. So I think it was an important time for me to be able to look back and remember my journey, appreciate my journey and be proud of where I am today.\n\n\"I think sometimes when you're in the moment you lose perspective of how hard you've worked and how far you've come. And I definitely, again, think I had a different perspective after a while of being retired.\"\n\nUS SKATING STARS FOR BEIJIN: Five things we learned from nationals\n\nIn the book, which was released Tuesday, Vonn takes readers through her early days in the sport – she and her father started mapping out her path to the Olympics when she was 9 – and her feelings at key junctures along the way. She writes about feeling overlooked and insecure as a teenage skier, for instance, and about the decision to use men's skis midway through her career.\n\nVonn also writes in detail about her battle with depression, which she managed throughout her career, in part with medication. She credits a new therapist with helping her work through retirement, which she describes as \"harder than any of my injuries, harder than anything I’ve done.\"\n\n\"I’ve been all over the spectrum, from thinking I didn’t need a therapist, to having a difficult time opening up to someone, to where I am today,\" Vonn writes in the book. \"Eventually, I came to realize that you won’t just wake up one day and discover that all your problems are gone. No one can do everything on their own — not even someone as independent and stubborn as I am.\"\n\nThough it might feel a bit strange, Vonn said she's looking forward to just being a \"regular spectator\" for the upcoming Winter Olympics, which begin Feb. 4. It will help that the first Games after her retirement are being held in China, at a venue where she's never raced.\n\n\"I think if it were somewhere else, I would always think, 'Well, I could have skied that section better,' or I would've wanted maybe to ski there more,\" she said. \"Because it's a new venue, because I'm retired, I think I'm going to be able to watch these Olympics and just be excited for my teammates.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/01/12/newly-named-hockey-olympian-wisniewski-its-icing-cake/1022201001/", "title": "It's icing on the cake for U.S. hockey Olympian James Wisniewski", "text": "Updated Jan. 12, 2018, 2:19 a.m. ET\n\nWith a new lease on his hockey life, James Wisniewski feels rejuvenated.\n\nThe 33-year-old Canton native and former Plymouth Whalers defenseman is among 15 former NHL players who will skate for 25-man U.S. squad next month in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games at PyeongChang, South Korea.\n\nThe door was opened last April, when NHL players and owners couldn't resolve scheduling issues, among others, during the 17-day February Winter Olympic break with the IOC and International Ice Hockey Federation. That ended a streak of participation by NHL players for five Winter Olympics.\n\nBut for players like Wisniewski, who is currently playing for the EC Kassel Huskies of the Deutschland Elite League 2 in Germany, it's become the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nWisniewski played a total of 552 NHL games, scoring 53 goals and totaling 274 points with stops along the way in Chicago, Anaheim, Columbus, Montreal, the New York Rangers and Carolina.\n\nCareer highlight\n\n\"It's got to be right up there with my first call-up to the NHL, my first game, my draft day, World Junior gold medal,\" Wisniewski said. \"But I think it's even got a little bit more special aspect to it, because of what I have been through the past 2½ years of almost retiring a couple of times. Just having the perseverance, dedication and drive to keep on moving and keep on going ... so everything has happened for a reason and I couldn't be happier and more blessed.\"\n\nThe official announcement for the U.S. team came Jan. 1, but Wisniewski was notified three days earlier.\n\n\"I actually missed the call from Jim Johannson (U.S. general manager) and I got a text and he said, 'Call me back, this could be a fun phone call,'\" Wisniewski said. \"I got the family together and told them that, called them. I got the news of a lifetime.\"\n\nHow Wisniewski made it all the way back to a spot on the Olympic team is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nIn the 2015-16 season opener with the Carolina Hurricanes, Wisniewski tore his anterior cruciate ligament, which scrapped him for the entire year. It was his fourth ACL surgery, but the first on his left knee.\n\nHis contract was then bought out by Carolina and, after rehabbing and getting back into shape that summer, Wisniewski landed in Tampa Bay's training camp in fall 2016, only to be released.\n\nChange of scenery\n\nHis NHL job search all but ended, but after four weeks off, he found himself in Russia with Admiral Vladivostok of the Kontinental Hockey League, where played in 16 games, scoring a goal and totaling 39 penalty minutes.\n\n\"Russia is different, it was good,\" Wisniewski said. \"The language barrier is a little bit tougher there. English is not such a common language as you can call it. (Vladivostok) was actually right there where we're going to play in PyeongChang. It was, like, a 2½-hour drive to North Korea. For me, it was just about really getting in shape and knowing that I could still play. So after missing a full year, I did my best, enjoyed the time and actually got to know the guys.\"\n\nJust before Christmas 2016, Wisniewski decided to leave the KHL and then found his way to Switzerland.\n\n\"I was really having a good time (in Russia) and moved on to play in the Spengler Cup with HC Lugano, which was an unbelievable city,\" said Wisniewski, who is nicknamed \"The Wiz.\" \"We lost in the finals to Canada. I made the all-star team and after that came back home.\"\n\nJob searching again, Wisniewski signed a minor league deal the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League, the NHL's St. Louis Blues affiliate team. He finished the 2016-17 season with the Wolves, posting 11 points in 21 games (along with five in the playoffs).\n\nBouncing around\n\n\"St. Louis, they kind of wanted their guys to play,\" Wisniewski said. \"I had a great time there and the guys were unbelievable to me. But again, still it's a development league. I kind of got pushed around there.\"\n\nOnce his AHL season ended, Wisniewski rejoined his family in Columbus, contemplating his next move.\n\n\"After playing a year, maybe I can get a tryout with an NHL team,\" Wisniewski said he thought. \"I'm waiting and waiting and I'm hearing about NHL and Olympics and the guys not able to go. So got a call from Jim Johannson and Chris Chelios (assistant coach) telling me they want me to go over there (Germany) and play overseas.\n\n\"I told them I want to wait and make sure I exhausted every option of going to the NHL. After that didn't happen, I tried to get a job and it wasn't as easy as I thought it was going to be. So I waited around and, finally, Jim actually helped me get a job with Kassel Huskies of DEL2 League. The owner and GM Joe Gibbs treated me very well. I called them up and got this gig.\"\n\nWisniewski, who started the season in Kassel, thought he'd get an invite for the U.S. in the Deutschland Cup, the world's oldest international ice hockey tournament. Seven days prior to the Nov. 10-12 tourney in Augsburg, Germany, Wisniewski's name was nowhere to be found on the U.S. roster.\n\nCrack in the door\n\n\"From what I heard, it was going to be hard to make the Olympic team if you're not on the Deutschland Cup team,\" he said. \"They announced the team and I'm not on it, so I'm devastated. Beginning in November, I went back home to visit the family during the seven-day break.\n\n\"I was just thinking I got to know if I'm going to go back over. My wife (Nicole) convinced me, 'Hey, you don't want to leave any stone unturned, go back over, play your heart out.' I called Jimmy and said, 'Is there any way possibly I can still make the team and get an evaluation?' He said, 'I already know you, so go back over, get in shape and see what happens.'\"\n\nThe 5-foot-11, 203-pound defenseman returned to Kassel and made the most of it. He's scored eight goals and added 31 assists during his first 25 games (through Jan. 7). He was also selected the DEL2's Player of the Month in November.\n\n\"I just kept on grinding, kept on grinding,\" Wisniewski said. \"And sure enough, I got a phone call around Dec. 29 that I made the team. Quite of a worldwind of an experience.\"\n\nThe U.S. roster, which also includes four current collegiate players, is a mixture of former NHL, minor league and European talent. Wisniewski, one of the team's elder statesmen, is one of three Michigan players on the roster, joining Jim Slater, who played a Michigan State, and Chad Billins, who played at Ferris State.\n\nNew intinerary\n\nWisniewski will leave Kassel on Feb. 7 and then take part in the Olympic Games opening ceremonies. The 12-team men's hockey tourney competition on Feb. 14, with the gold medal game set for Feb. 25.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Tony Granato, will play three preliminary-round games against Slovenia (Feb. 14), Slovakia (Feb. 16) and Russia (Feb. 17) before the quarterfinal elimination round starts (Feb. 21).\n\n\"They said make sure you play every game like it's the Olympics,\" Wisniewski said, \"You're playing for the red, white and blue jersey and make sure you're ready to come, because I trust all you guys will be professionals and we'll be in contact with the type of style that we'll have and what not. It's a lot of pressure on us to make sure we're ready to go and ready to move on, because we only actually have three days of practice before the first game.\"\n\nGold medalist twice\n\nAfter becoming the highest scoring defenseman in Whalers history with 187 points from 2000-04, Wisniewski was drafted in the fifth round, 156th overall, by the Blackhawks in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nHe won a gold medal at the 2002 IIHF Men's Under-18 World Championship and was part of the first-ever U.S. gold medal at the 2004 IIHF World Junior Championship.\n\nWisniewski has appeared for the U.S. four times, including the 2008 IIHF Men's World Championship, appearing in six games with a goal and assist as the U.S. finished sixth.\n\nWisniewski will have a strong cheering section supporting him in PyeongChang.\n\nAlong with his wife Nicole, daughters Jamie, who will be 5 next month, and Sadie, 3½, will be in attendance, as well as his mother Sharon and father Jim.\n\nWisniewski will stay and play in Kassel, a city located on the Fulda River in northern Hesse, Germany, until embarking on his first Olympics.\n\n\"The good thing is that I've been seeing the world,\" Wisniewski said. \"Not many people can say they've been as many places as I have. It's been fantastic. The people over here have been unbelievable. The team and everybody on the coaching staff and in the locker room welcomed you with open arms. The organization has been absolutely fabulous. For me, it's been pretty easy of a turnaround and it's been real enjoyable because, actually, it's gotten me to enjoy hockey again because the last 2½ years has been really tough. I was ready to turn the page on my career and move on, but this year has actually lighted another spark. And I still feel I have a lot more hockey left to give.\"\n\nStrong on links\n\nThis won't be the first time Wisniewski has been to South Korea.\n\nA scratch golfer with a plus-two handicap, he won the club championship at Jack Nicklaus's Muirfield Village course in 2012, which earned him in a spot in the World Golf Club Championship.\n\n\"They take 24 of the top 100 private clubs in the world,\" Wisniewski said. \"The winner of the club championship brings a partner, so I went to Seoul for three days, then played at Nine Bridges, where they had a PGA Tour stop, on Jeju Island.\"\n\nWinning a gold medal for the U.S. in South Korea would certainly be frosting on the cake for Wisniewski, who feels he's been reborn as a hockey player.\n\n\"Honestly, every day at the rink I have fun,\" he said. \"Next month is going to be one of the best birthdays of all time. I'll be 34 on Feb. 21 and, I'll tell you, I'll never forget that birthday in PyeongChang and being an Olympian for the best country in the world.\"\n\nbemons@hometownlife.com\n\nTwitter: @BradEmons1", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2025/02/18/2026-winter-olympic-games-info-how-watch-milano-cortina-dates-times/79070124007/", "title": "2026 Winter Olympic Games: When does it start and what to know", "text": "Feb. 18, 2025, 10:55 a.m. ET\n\nAfter a thrilling 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris that gave us huge triumphs and significant upsets, the world is now eagerly anticipating the 2026 Winter Olympics, which are officially a year away.\n\nItaly, a country with a rich history in winter sports, will host the Winter Games for the third time as Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo prepare to host the 2026 Winter Games.
